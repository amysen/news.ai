We have seen this movie before. Sexual harassment complaints to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission increased 73 percent in the year after Anita Hill’s televised testimony about Clarence Thomas’s behavior in 1991. Still, Mr. Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court, while Ms. Hill went quietly back to being a law professor in Oklahoma. In the ensuing years, the issue cycled between headlines and whispers in a seemingly endless loop.

But this sequel seems to have a surprise ending, or at least a plot twist: The public outrage is deeper and more sustained, and the dominoes continue to fall.

Meet Our New Gender Editor .

Maybe it’s that the accusers this time were famous, media-savvy and mostly white actors with more star power than the accused (unlike, say, Paula Jones vs. Bill Clinton). Maybe it’s reflective of a specific period in American history, in which working women of a new generation — those who had grown up with working mothers — decided that enough was enough.

Certainly the endlessly expanding power of social media plays a role: The #metoo hashtag has been used in millions of posts over the past few weeks; been translated into Italian (#QuellaVoltaChe, or “that time when”) and French (#BalanceTonPorc, or “out your pig”); and inspired a congressional spinoff.

Several experts likened it to a dam breaking, the cumulative effect of harassment claims over decades and especially the last few years. Some see it as the other shoe dropping after Donald J. Trump’s taped boasting about offensive behavior did not block his path to the presidency: He may have gotten away with it, but women were no longer going to let that boss, that mentor, that colleague get away with it, too.

“There is no doubt that having an accused sexual predator in the White House is hanging over this,” said Jaclyn Friedman, the author of “Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power, and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All,” scheduled for publication this month. “People feel like they can’t do anything about that right now, but at least they can do something about this.”

An Army of Voices

If you are a woman, or know somebody who is, it’s safe to assume you have talked about Mr. Weinstein at the dinner table, on the subway, in bed, at work, and any other place where people gather. Perhaps you’ve asked your partner, your mother, your boss or your friend for the first time, as I have, if she, too, is among this strange new tribe. (“Who was your Weinstein?” we all suddenly want to know.)

I’ve heard from women who said they’ve retroactively confronted their harassers and those who enabled them, and from men who are re-examining, perhaps somewhat nervously, their own behavior. The new conversation goes way beyond the workplace to sweep in street harassment, rape culture and “toxic masculinity” — terminology that would have been confined to gender studies classes, not found in mainstream newspapers, not so long ago.

“In the women’s movement of the 1970s we had this phrase ‘the click moment,’” Barbara Berg, a historian and the author of the 2009 book “Sexism in America: Alive, Well and Ruining Our Future,” said. “This is the click moment. It’s like, ‘Enough.’ And then there’s a snowball effect: Once you see women speaking truth to power and not being told, ‘This is just what you have to put up with,’ then it encourages other women to stand up.”

With Mr. Weinstein, the accusers were on the record, poised, and more of them seem to emerge each day, so no individual had to bear the burden alone, as Professor Hill had. “When you have Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow in the same sentence, well, people take note,” the sociologist Michael Kimmel said.

But behind these famous faces was an army of ordinary voices, too, using social media to collectively tell their stories — but also for action. In the case of Bill O’Reilly, remember, it was a coordinated effort, by groups that included the organizers of the Women’s March, that urged advertisers to #DropOReilly. They, and Fox News, ultimately did.

Another significant new element is the presence of what many have called silent co-conspirators: dozens of people, over dozens of years, who knew what was going on but did nothing.

“There is this web of enablers,” Professor Kimmel, who runs the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University, said. “Bob Weinstein doesn’t say to Harvey, ‘You better stop or I’ll kick you out of the company.’ Billy Bush does not say to Donald Trump, ‘That’s disgusting, not to mention illegal.’ In the sexual assault world we often talk about how we incorrectly interpret women’s silence as consent. Well, we also mistake men’s silence for assent.”

A Look Back

If this is a moment of historical social change, it is worth looking at what led us here.

It was two years after that Ms. magazine cover, in 1979, that Catharine A. MacKinnon published a groundbreaking legal argument: that sexual harassment was a form of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was based on a legal theory she had developed while in law school.

Photo

That legal argument was tested with Mechelle Vinson, one of a number of African-American women who were involved in early sexual harassment lawsuits — this one a bank teller who said she was repeatedly raped by her married boss. In 1986, her case, with Professor MacKinnon’s help, was part of a Supreme Court ruling that enshrined the harassment-as-discrimination theory into law.

Then came Professor Hill, whose televised testimony about Mr. Thomas, her former boss — at the E.E.O.C., of all places — was, Ms. Berg said, in effect “home-schooling a generation of Americans in what sexual harassment was.” Almost immediately, the phone hotline for 9to5, a support group for working women, began ringing off the hook.

“People were almost bewildered,” the group’s director told The New York Times in 1992. “You mean this is sexual harassment? You mean I could do something about this?”

Ms. Berg said she remembers a former colleague calling to ask, of their former boss, “Did he proposition you, too?” (He had.) Professor Kimmel said his mother told him over dinner that she was harassed in graduate school.

“It was literally water-cooler conversation everywhere,” said Freada Kapor Klein, who conducted one of the first surveys on sexual harassment in the 1970s.

But most of those stories were shared in private — in part because of what the world watched Professor Hill endure. Before an all-male Senate judiciary panel, she was accused of bringing “sleaze” into the nomination process, portrayed as suffering from delusional fantasies, and famously called, by the pundit David Brock, “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.”

“I remember the anger of that moment,” Teresa Younger, then a 22-year-old nanny and now president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, said. “Anita Hill was the example of a strong, accomplished black woman, and if she of all people could be discredited then it seemed women, particularly women of color, had no voice when it came to sexual harassment.”

From ‘I Believe’ to #metoo

It’s worth noting that the campaign slogan back then, on buttons and bumper stickers rather than Facebook and Twitter, was not “Me Too” but “I Believe Anita” — a message of solidarity, not self-exposure.

After Professor Hill came Ms. Jones, whose lawsuit against Mr. Clinton was dismissed. Others won in court but struggled in the aftermath: Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was sexually assaulted by drunken officers, was sidelined and ultimately quit her job. Rena Weeks, a law secretary who was harassed by a partner, never worked again.

“I think for a long time it shut women up, at least publicly,” Professor Kimmel said.

In her 2017 book, “Butterfly Politics,” Professor MacKinnon adapts a concept from chaos theory in which the tiny motion of a butterfly’s wings can trigger a tornado half a world away. Under the right conditions, she posits, small actions can produce major social transformations.

“Ashley Judd is the butterfly of this moment,” Professor MacKinnon said of the actor who began the recent groundswell of accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “She is the one who broke it open, who has made this possible for so many other women. And so you have an explosion of it because it’s for so long been suppressed.”

Professor Kimmel, the sociologist, said, “There comes a tipping point when the ‘frame’ changes.”

”One day, segregated water fountains seemed ‘normal’ if you were a white Southerner,” he noted. “It’s just how things were. Then they’re illegal, and a few years later you say, ‘Wow, how did we ever see that as O.K.?’”

Ms. Friedman, though, said she is waiting for an important moment: “When are we going to start believing people the first time?”

“When is it going to be that one instance is enough, and that you don’t have to find out 30 years later?” she asked. “I also worry that there is the possibility for this to be treated like a cancer, and now Harvey is gone so the cancer is excised. But Harvey is not the only cancer.”",The ‘Click’ Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/sexual-harrasment-weinstein-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It’s a good question to ask when planning a menu. The original New World Thanksgiving dinner — a several-days-long feast — was lavish, but it is likely that green vegetables were not abundant.

Gourds, melons, pumpkins and squashes were the vegetables of choice, or carrots and parsnips grown from seed brought by the settlers. Dried native corn was ground, and either baked into cakes or cooked for porridge. Berries and other wild fruits such as plums, gooseberries and grapes were much appreciated.

But mostly there was game to eat, and plenty of it. Wild turkeys and pheasants, ducks, geese and swans were spit-roasted, as was a vast supply of venison. Cod and lobster were plentiful. Shellfish was abundant, too; huge coastal beds were stacked with oysters, clams and mussels, just waiting to be plucked.

Over centuries, the Thanksgiving menu has changed. Giant turkeys and hams now dominate the meal, and vegetables have more real estate on the sideboard. In many respects, however, the repertoire has remained the same — somewhat bland and soft. We put forth mashed potatoes, soggy peas, green-bean casserole, creamed onions, marshmallow-topped canned sweet potatoes and bread stuffing. Salads are shunned by many Thanksgiving cooks. (With exceptions, of course.)

I get it. Nostalgia makes us, myself included, crave these dull and mellow accompaniments. Even so, I’m usually inclined to tinker just a little. I monkey around with the bird’s seasoning, and, for the vegetables, I want some bright flavors and colors to contrast with the generally monochromatic basics. I always turn my cranberries into spicy chutney, for instance. This year, I’m playing with basic vegetables like carrots, cauliflower and brussels sprouts.

Mashed carrots may bring baby food to mind, or a fancy French purée, but these “smashed” ones are something else, and they have texture. Add the salty tang of feta cheese and lots of chopped fresh mint, and the carrots’ sweetness becomes a playful partner in a new scheme.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

Afterward, the president was formally received by Mr. Abe on a red carpet at Akasaka Palace, a neo-Baroque building that resembles Buckingham Palace. The two men inspected an honor guard, glittering in gold braid, their rifles fixed with bayonets.

Earlier, however, Mr. Trump used a breakfast meeting of Japanese and American business executives to deliver a scathing critique of the trade relationship between the two countries. Japan, he said, bought virtually no cars from the United States while exporting millions of vehicles into the American market.

“Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over,” Mr. Trump said, disregarding the fact that Japanese carmakers have built huge assembly plants in the United States. “That’s not too much to ask,” he continued. “Is that rude to ask?”

In somewhat gentler terms, Mr. Trump told Mr. Abe that the United States was seeking a new kind of trade relationship. Though he praised the Japanese economy, the president added, “I don’t know if it’s as good as ours. I think not, O.K.?” he said, shooting Mr. Abe a gimlet-eyed glance. “And we’re going to try to keep it that way, and you’ll be second.”

Still, Mr. Trump also showed a keen appreciation of the domestic politics of his host. At Mr. Abe’s behest, the president met with the families of Japanese people kidnapped by North Korea, an issue that has deep political resonance among Japanese.

At the news conference, Mr. Trump likened the plight of these families to that of the family of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and died a few days after being returned to the United States in a coma-like state.

Whether by design or otherwise, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly rejected the idea of direct negotiations with North Korea over curbing its nuclear program, seemed to suggest his stance could change if Mr. Kim returned the Japanese people his regime had abducted. North Korea has said that most of the abductees are dead.

“Now the spotlight is on, and perhaps we could have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong-un would send them back. If he would send them back that would be the start of something — I think it would be just something very special if they would do that.”

Mr. Abe, for his part, played to his guest’s appetite for ceremony — and spontaneity. As the two leaders strolled to lunch in a private dining room overlooking a koi pond, they were each given a wooden box of fish food and a spoon. After a few moments of delicately spooning the flakes into the pond, a restless Mr. Abe tossed in the remains of his box, leading Mr. Trump to dump his, too.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe then took seats at a long, low table on a floor covered with straw tatami mats. At the news conference, the prime minister referred repeatedly to Mr. Trump by his first name, Donald, recounting their meetings at Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, the president’s Florida estate, and a dinner here on Sunday so enjoyable that he said they lost track of time.

“How many hours of dialogue have we had?” Mr. Abe asked. “I believe there have been never been such close bonds.”

Mr. Abe reacted mildly to reports in the Japanese media — which Mr. Trump implicitly confirmed during the news conference — that Mr. Trump was dismayed by Japan’s decision not to shoot down missiles North Korea fired over Japanese territory in August and September. The missiles flew over the island of Hokkaido before landing harmlessly in the sea.

In conversations with other Asian leaders, a senior American official said, Mr. Trump asked why a country of “samurai warriors” did not shoot down the missiles, which the North Koreans launched in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Mr. Trump did not directly address the issue on Monday, though he noted that over the weekend an American antimissile system had shot down a missile fired on Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Japan had tracked the missiles North Korea fired over Japan, Mr. Abe said, and would have shot them down if they had posed a threat to Japanese citizens.

Japan’s American-made missile defense systems would have enabled it to shoot down the missile that flew over Hokkaido on Aug. 29, though not a subsequent one tested on Sept. 15. It is also possible Japan could have missed if it tried to shoot the missiles down, which would have been an acute embarrassment.

Legally, the question is even more complicated. Japan can only intercept a missile if its citizens are in danger or if there is an attack on an allied country that could jeopardize Japan’s security, said Noboru Yamaguchi, professor of international relations at the International University of Japan in Niigata.

Since North Korea has so far only conducted missile tests — as opposed to launching missiles armed with live warheads — Japan does not have the legal right to intercept them. Moreover, said Mr. Yamaguchi who is a retired lieutenant general in Japan’s military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, the prime minister would need approval from Japan’s Parliament for any such action.

Mr. Yamaguchi dismissed Mr. Trump’s reference to samurai warriors as a caricature. “Samurais are quiet up until the last moment,” he said. “And at the last moment, samurais do things decisively.”

At a dinner at the Akasaka Palace on Monday night, Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe showered praise on each other, reminiscing about how the Japanese prime minister was an early visitor to the newly elected American president before he took office.

Mr. Trump laid responsibility for the episode squarely on Mr. Abe, saying in his toast that he tried to prevent the visit after aides said it would be inappropriate to meet with a foreign leader before the inauguration, but Mr. Abe was already on his way to New York.

“I said, “There’s no way he lands and I don’t see him,’” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Abe. “I saw him, and it worked out just fine.”",Trump Tells Japan It Can Protect Itself by Buying U.S. Arms,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/asia/trump-japan-shinzo-abe.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And over the last several weeks he has ordered enough high-profile arrests of intellectuals and clerics to frighten the remainder of the academic and religious establishment into acceding to his will as well.

Apolitical scholars who used to speak freely in cafes now look nervously over their shoulders, as Crown Prince Mohammed has achieved a degree of dominance that no ruler has attained for generations.

“It is the coup de grâce of the old system,” said Chas W. Freeman, a former United States ambassador. “Gone. All power has now been concentrated in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.”

Why the crown prince acted now — whether to eliminate future opposition or perhaps to crush some threat he saw brewing — was not immediately clear.

At 32 years old, he had little experience in government before his father, King Salman, 81, ascended to the throne in 2015, and the prince has demonstrated little patience for the previously staid pace of change in the kingdom.

He has led Saudi Arabia into a protracted military conflict in Yemen and a bitter feud with its Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar. He has taken on a business elite accustomed to state subsidies and profligacy by laying out radical plans to remake the Saudi economy, lessen its dependence on oil and rely instead on foreign investment. And he has squared off against conservatives in the religious establishment with symbolic steps to loosen strict moral codes, including a pending end to the longstanding ban on women driving.

Crown Prince Mohammed’s haste, however, may now come at a price, because the lack of transparency or due process surrounding the anticorruption crackdown is sure to unnerve the same private investors he hopes to attract — including through a planned stock offering of the huge state oil company, Aramco.

Saudi Arabian businessmen and royals anxious about the crown prince’s plans were quietly moving assets out of the country even before the arrests.

“Some of these are businessmen with international status, and if they are caught in this web then it could happen to anyone,” said James M. Dorsey, who studies Saudi Arabia at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “How is that going to inspire confidence and attract foreign investment?”

The Saudi Arabian news media, however, celebrated the arrests as a long-awaited cleanup, appealing to populist resentment of self-enrichment enjoyed by the sprawling royal family and its closest allies.

Almost everyone in the capital, Riyadh, and other big cities like Jidda has heard stories about princes absconding with vast sums that had been allocated for a public project.

The arrests are “a frontal assault on some members of the royal family and the impunity with which they have operated in the past,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.

“It was something that had to be done,” he said, even though the absence of a judicial process “sends a chill down the spine of foreign investors.”

President Trump on Sunday appeared to give a tacit endorsement of the arrests in a phone call with King Salman. A White House summary of the call contained no references to the arrests, and said Mr. Trump had praised Crown Prince Mohammed for other matters.

Three White House advisers, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned just days ago from the latest in at least three high-level Trump administration visits to Saudi Arabia this year.

Nearly 24 hours after the arrests were announced, no Saudi authority or spokesman had identified those arrested or the charges against them.

The Saudi-owned satellite network Al Arabiya reported only that a large number of arrests, including 11 princes, had been ordered by an “anticorruption committee” that just hours earlier had been formed under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed. A royal decree granted the committee powers to detain individuals or seize assets without any trial, process or disclosure.

A list of those arrested began circulating over social media shortly after midnight Sunday, and by Sunday evening senior government officials were reposting the list. News organizations around the region were reporting its contents without contradiction by either the Saudi government or individuals.

In the case of the most politically potent of the detainees, the former security chief Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the Saudi government appeared on Sunday to have started a social media campaign seeking to make him the new face of public corruption.

Analysts said the list appeared to reflect individuals with a reputation for self-enrichment and those representing rival power centers within the kingdom. Others included the power broker who once ran the royal court under King Abdullah, and the owner of one of the biggest private media companies in the region.

But another was a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed himself — Adel Fakeih — who had been considered a driving force behind the ambitious program of economic reform, leaving analysts puzzled about the motives.

In what appeared to be an unrelated episode, a helicopter carrying another Saudi royal, Prince Mansur bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir Province, which borders Yemen, crashed on Sunday, killing the prince along with a number of other officials. Al Arabiya, which reported the crash in a brief dispatch, did not identify the cause.

The history of the House of Saud was sometimes punctuated by violent intrafamily strife in the decades before the founding of the modern dynasty, in 1932. Since then, the family has maintained its unity in part by spreading its top government roles and vast oil wealth among different branches of the sprawling clan. Most important was the division of the three main security services, which constitute the hard power on the ground.

King Salman, however, quickly named his favorite son, Mohammed, as his defense minister, chief of the royal court, a top economic adviser and deputy crown prince. Then, this June, the king removed his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, from his position as crown prince and his powerful role of interior minister in charge of the internal security forces, secret police and counterterrorism operations. Evidently anxious to forestall resistance, the king also placed the demoted nephew under house arrest. A campaign of leaks spread rumors that he had become addicted to painkillers and other drugs.

It was unclear why the crackdown targeted Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is best known for his past and present investments in brand-name Western companies including Twitter, News Corporation, Apple and the Four Seasons. Prince Alwaleed has been a vocal supporter of the crown prince’s plans to attract outside investors to Saudi Arabia. But when a committee of 34 senior family members — known as the allegiance council — approved Prince Mohammed’s elevation to crown prince, one of the three dissenters was from Prince Alwaleed’s branch of the family, the Talals, according to people familiar with the voting.

Michael Stephens, who studies Saudi Arabia at the Royal United Services Institute in London, recalled the bloody purges other leaders in the region have sometimes used to eliminate rivals. What Crown Prince Mohammed was doing, Mr. Stephens said, “is a more genteel way of making sure there are no challenges to your power.”

Time will tell, Mr. Stephens said, whether the arrests signal a slide into despotism or “whether we will look back and say Mohammed bin Salman is the one guy who saw the wall coming and managed to hurdle it.”",Saudi Crown Prince’s Mass Purge Upends a Longstanding System,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/middleeast/saudi-crown-prince-purge.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Just before the fall of the czar, Lenin reflected to his wife that revolution “won’t happen in our lifetime.” Ultimately, it was a spontaneous, disorganized popular uprising and a crisis of military loyalty that forced Nicholas’s abdication. When that moment arrived, Lenin was in Zurich, Trotsky in New York and Stalin in Siberia.

Lenin initially thought it was “a hoax.” He was lucky that Germany inserted him like a bacillus (via the so-called sealed train) to take Russia out of the war. Back in Petrograd, Lenin, aided by fellow-radicals Trotsky and Stalin, had to overpower erring Bolshevik comrades, who proposed cooperation with the provisional government, and force them to agree to his plan for a coup. The government should have found and killed him but it failed to do so. He succeeded.

Even the “storming” of the Winter Palace — restaged in a 1920 propaganda spectacular as a people’s triumph — was no storming at all. Lenin rages as it took days to seize the main buildings of the government, while the palace itself was taken by climbing through unlocked windows, undefended except for adolescent cadets — followed by a bacchanalia, with drunk Bolsheviks slurping the czar’s Château d’Yquem 1847 out of the gutters.

October might have heralded a short-lived interim, like so many other failed revolutions of that era. Any coordinated attack by White armies, the other side in the Russian civil war, or any intervention by Western forces would have swept the Bolsheviks away. It all depended on Lenin. He was very nearly overthrown in a coup by rebellious coalition partners but he made his own luck, though, by a combination of ideological passion, ruthless pragmatism, unchecked bloodletting and the will to establish a dictatorship. And sometimes, he just got plain lucky: On Aug. 30, 1918, he was shot while addressing a crowd of workers at a factory in Moscow. He survived by inches.

Had any of these events foiled Lenin, our own times would be radically different. Without Lenin there would have been no Hitler. Hitler owed much of his rise to the support of conservative elites who feared a Bolshevik revolution on German soil and who believed that he alone could defeat Marxism. And the rest of his radical program was likewise justified by the threat of Leninist revolution. His anti-Semitism, his anti-Slavic plan for Lebensraum and above all the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 were supported by the elites and the people because of the fear of what the Nazis called “Judeo-Bolshevism.”

Without the Russian Revolution of 1917, Hitler would likely have ended up painting postcards in one of the same flophouses where he started. No Lenin, no Hitler — and the 20th century becomes unimaginable. Indeed, the very geography of our imagination becomes unimaginable.

The East would look as different as the West. Mao, who received huge amounts of Soviet aid in the 1940s, would not have conquered China, which might still be ruled by the family of Chiang Kai-shek. The inspirations that illuminated the mountains of Cuba and the jungles of Vietnam would never have been. Kim Jong-un, pantomimic pastiche of Stalin, would not exist. There would have been no Cold War. The tournaments of power would likely have been just as vicious — just differently vicious.

The Russian Revolution mobilized a popular passion across the world based on Marxism-Leninism, fueled by messianic zeal. It was, perhaps, after the three Abrahamic religions, the greatest millenarian rapture of human history.

That virtuous idealism justified any monstrosity. The Bolsheviks admired the cleansing purges of Robespierre’s Reign of Terror: “A revolution without firing squads is meaningless,” Lenin said. The Bolsheviks created the first professional revolutionaries, the first total police state, the first modern mass-mobilization on behalf of class war against counterrevolution. Bolshevism was a mind-set, an idiosyncratic culture with an intolerant paranoid wordview obsessed with abstruse Marxist ideology. Their zeal justified the mass killings of all enemies, real and potential, not just by Lenin or Stalin but also Mao, Pol Pot in Cambodia, Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia. It also gave birth to slave labor camps, economic catastrophe and untold psychological damage. (These events are now so long ago that the horrors have been blurred and history forgotten; a glamorous glow of power and idealism lingers to intoxicate young voters disenchanted with the bland dithering of liberal capitalism.)

And then there is Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union. President Vladimir Putin’s power is enforced by his fellow former K.G.B. officers, the heirs of Lenin and Stalin’s secret police. Mr. Putin and his regime have adopted the Leninist tactics of “konspiratsia” and “dezinformatsiya,” which have turned out to be ideally suited to today’s technologies. Americans may have invented the internet, but they saw it (decadently) as a means of making money or (naïvely) as a magical click to freedom. The Russians, bred on Leninist cynicism, harnessed it to undermine American democracy.

Mr. Putin mourned the fall of Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, yet he regards Lenin as an agent of chaos between two epochs of national grandeur — the Romanovs before Nicholas II (Peter the Great and Alexander III are favorites) and Soviet Union’s superpower glory under Stalin.

Mr. Putin presents himself as a czar — and like any czar, he fears revolution above all else. That is why it is victory against Germany in 1945, not the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 that is the founding myth of Putinist Russia. Hence the irony that while the West has been discussing the revolution at length, Russia is largely pretending it never happened.

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

PhotoIn his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.","Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.

No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.

A Russian Billionaire Investor’s Stake in American Technology Companies The Kremlin controls Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank. Gazprom Investholding lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Kanton Services. Kanton Services owned DST USA II, which was used to invest in Facebook. VTB Bank gave $191 million to DST Investments 3 for its stake in Twitter. The venture capitalist Yuri Milner founded DST Global, which managed DST USA II and DST Investments 3.

Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America’s technology giants.

“Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind — not just commercial interests but state interests as well,” said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. “They go hand in hand.”

Mr. Carpenter added, “Oligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia’s crony capitalist system.”

There is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.

As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple — “nothing more than business,” he said, adding: “We are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it’s a commercial arrangement.”

(A statement from DST Global, Mr. Milner’s venture capital firm, appears here.)

The Path to Silicon Valley

Mr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.

He returned to Russia and in the late 1990s and worked as an executive at Bank Menatep, which was founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil tycoon who was stripped of his company, prosecuted and imprisoned after a televised confrontation with President Vladimir V. Putin.

Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov — an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev — and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.

Mr. Milner’s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia’s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.

In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner’s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner’s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.

“A number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said at the time.

The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection — through a succession of shell companies — to the Kremlin.

Ties to the Russian State

In those years, as part of its diplomatic “reset” with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia’s dependence on exporting oil and gas.

For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.

Gazprom Investholding is “used for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,” said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding’s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Over several years, Gazprom Investholding and a subsidiary made hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to a company called Kanton Services, according to records from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. Kanton, in turn, owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook. While it is unclear precisely when Kanton first received its stake in the DST entity, Kanton received $197 million of the Gazprom Investholding loans three months before Facebook announced its first deal with Mr. Milner, the records show.

Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner’s backer, Mr. Usmanov.

Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov’s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a “private investment company, (facebook and twitter).”

In the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors’ identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. “I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,” he said. What’s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.

Photo

To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like “Alleged Russian government funds,” “Mr. Usmanov” and “Facebook.” He pulled out a large bag of green M&M’s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M’s from one cup to another. “Money is fungible,” he explained, adding, “You can’t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.”

A spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, “did not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.”

Lucrative ‘Synergies’

The Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia’s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government’s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.

In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as “synergies.”

The Kroll report — a “reputation audit” — had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.

The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals — involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. “Usmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the ‘most improved’ oligarch over the past eight years,” one source told Kroll.

Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner’s Facebook investment.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a “passive investor” and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.

Gazprom Investholding called the loans “prudent,” saying they were “provided for general corporate purposes” at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he “operated in accordance” with the company’s charter.

To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.

After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.

In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company’s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.

At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. “I think it’s actually the opposite,” he replied. “I sometimes get informal advice from them.”

Obscure Financial Maneuvers

Mr. Milner’s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB.

Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB’s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank’s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.

VTB has operations across the world, including in the United States. In recent years, it has been involved in a number of politically sensitive deals, including a loan that financed the Russian government’s murky privatization of 19.5 percent of the oil giant Rosneft.

Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.

Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers “unsubstantiated.”

“VTB is really a slush fund for Putin,” said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is “the black cashier of the Putin crowd.”

Mr. Milner’s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB’s involvement.

In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global’s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.

The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.

On May 7, 2014 — six months after Twitter’s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares — VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.

DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.

In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was “solely a financial investment,” sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, “VTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.”

Twitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.

Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.

Beyond Social Media

Mr. Milner has also been active beyond Silicon Valley. He is a founder of the Breakthrough Prize, a series of lucrative scientific awards. And in July 2015, he was one of several high-profile investors in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother, Joshua. (Other investors and partners include Goldman Sachs, George Soros and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.)

Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global’s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.

Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.

In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.

Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, “if you’re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it’s easy to say, ‘Please don’t get involved in politics.’”

That “was my principle back then and still now,” he said, adding: “I prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy.

Ditto with “Dinkins years” (the “gorgeous mosaic,” tennis rackets, Crown Heights riots), “Giuliani years” (squeegee men, Derek Jeter, Twin Towers) or “Bloomberg years” (bike lanes, luxury condos, waterfront parks). Love ’em or hate ’em, each of them had their drama.

The “de Blasio years”? The mind goes blank. It’s hard to say, four years in, what represents this era. Gourmet food trucks, maybe? Food halls? As the mayors got taller, the mayoralty got smaller.

The public scourges Minnie Mouse and Elmo are confined to mascot ghettos in Times Square known as designated activity zones. There was, if memory serves, a blizzard that everyone freaked out about, although it’s hard to remember when, or why. It’s hard enough to remember just how to spell the mayor’s name. (It’s not “DiBlasio,” but you can be forgiven if you have to Google it.)

Mayor de Blasio’s New York is neither a city on the brink (despite this past week’s deadly terror attack) nor a city reborn. Crime is down, and test scores are up, but few seem to be paying close enough attention to know that.

At last, here’s an image that floods to mind: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

To be fair, no one was shrugging at Terminal 5, the music club on West 56th Street, this past Monday, as the mayor took the stage with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and Senator Bernie Sanders, in what passes for a climactic campaign appearance in a mayoral battle that is shaping up to be as lopsided as ... something incredibly lopsided. Polls show the mayor, seeking a second term, ahead of his Republican challenger 61 percent to 17 percent. (Extra credit if you can name Mr. de Blasio’s Republican challenger — double extra credit if you can spell it: It’s Nicole Malliotakis.)

Despite the presence of Mr. Sanders, the hall was maybe half full. Efforts to get a “four more years!” chant faded quickly as the mayor, looking like a retired Knicks power forward (he is 6-foot-5), rose to tower over the podium in a gray suit and yellow power tie.

“I want to start with a tale of audacity,” Mr. de Blasio said, sounding more amiable than audacious, before ticking off his administration’s accomplishments, which included universal pre-K, two rent freezes and free legal counsel for people facing eviction.

The mayor spoke glowingly of Mr. Sanders as the shining beacon of his own “progressive” politics. (Mr. de Blasio backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.)

“Bernie Sanders defines the idea of audacity,” he said, showing America’s left “that we had a power that we didn’t even know we had.”

A crowd of union members in red jackets sipped beer from plastic cups in the back. That seemed fitting: The affable, jocky Mr. de Blasio, more than any mayor in memory, certainly fits the time-honored political test of “who would you want to have a beer with?” (If you tried to play quarters with Mr. Giuliani, he’d probably arrest you for gambling.)

But the mayor tacitly acknowledged that he is more of a conduit for a political philosophy than a lightning rod.

“The candidate matters,” he said, quoting a Sanders talking point, “but the movement matters even more.”

Mayor de Blasio’s movement, such as it is, has left a mark. Despite howls that changes to policing would send the city spiraling back to the “Death Wish” 1970s, school crime is down and major crimes are down 9 percent during his tenure — with, the administration says, a 93 percent reduction in the “stop and frisk” tactics by police that long have marred the daily life of, in particular, young African-Americans. What’s more, a recent Quinnipiac University survey reported that 82 percent of likely African-American voters expressed a favorable opinion of the mayor.

The problem is that Mr. Giuliani long ago cemented his legacy as the crime fighter mayor in the public imagination, however deserved that may be. Any mayor who follows is simply Crime Fighter 1B.

Mayor Bloomberg never achieved quite the same action-hero persona, but as an archetype of the politician-as-C.E.O., he was nationally famous enough that he is still having to explain why he did not grace the 2016 presidential ticket with his presence.

Mayor de Blasio, in theory, might someday enter the White House (without joining a group tour). But as what, exactly? What is his “brand?” Many of his administration’s headline-making initiatives seem comically pointillist in scope, even absurdist, as if conjured by a late-night Mad Libs sessions in City Hall. Who can forget the crackdown on motorcycle wheelies? The striking down of the ban on ferret ownership? The new curbs on subway pole dancing?

That is the outsider’s view, anyway. To those who work in or around city politics, this administration has been anything but dull. The mayor — at times feisty, at times aloof — has become embroiled in countless headline-grabbing tussles with the tabloids, the police force and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. He has had to fight off both a state and federal investigation into his fund-raising.

Legacy, however, is about perception, not policy, and when it comes to perception, timing is everything. It is neither fair nor sane to credit (or blame) a mayor with everything that happens in the city on his watch. Everyone does it anyway.

New Yorkers, for example, tend to forget the patronage scandals and crack wars of the years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. What they remember is “Hizzoner,” a cuddly cartoon vision of an irrepressible New Yorker who we think brought New York back from the dead.

Not that Mr. Koch had much to do with the booming stock market, which flooded the streets with Salomon Brothers bonus money that heated up the market for TriBeCa lofts, bad installation art and squid-ink pasta to surface-of-Mercury levels. Mayor Koch was not out there on the floor at Danceteria, teaching a young Madonna her moves, or scribbling rhymes for Slick Rick, or guiding Basquiat’s paintbrush. But it is all part of the lore of the “Koch years.”

Mayor de Blasio, by contrast, inherited a city that was in fine health, but even so, we’re left feeling around for its pulse.

The new mayor had not even moved from his home in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Gracie Mansion when celebrated New Yorkers, including David Byrne, the former frontman of the Talking Heads, started to decree the city “over.” In an oft-quoted Guardian essay from 2013, Mr. Byrne decried the sterile, moneyed New York as a lifeless museum city, like Venice — since “most of Manhattan and many parts of Brooklyn are virtual walled communities, pleasure domes for the rich.”

The next year, Moby, the techno pioneer, tea shop entrepreneur and longtime cultural truffle pig, went so far as to declare Los Angeles, not New York, the new mecca for young bohemians, in another Guardian essay. Having done the Horace Greeley thing himself, Moby, a former East Village resident, hailed his new West Coast headquarters as a place where young artists “can really experiment” — and live cheap and fail fast.

This creeping bouge-ification that left the city a sea of chain stores and Starbucks did not happen overnight. But even Mr. Bloomberg had the Strokes.

Those tattooed New York cool kids who haven’t yet decamped for Silver Lake might at least give Mayor de Blasio credit for trying. His tenure has seen the loosening of marijuana enforcement (low-level possession often results in a summons, not arrest, particularly for whites), and the overturning of the oft-derided cabaret law, which made it illegal to dance in bars, going back to the days of the Charleston.

Even so, the aging hipsters who forever croak about the grit and glamour of the bad old days will hardly find solace in a New York where CBGB is still a John Varvatos boutique, smoking remains taboo unless we’re talking lox at Barney Greengrass, and the police hand out $190 tickets for running a red light ... on a bicycle. Sodom and Gomorrah this ain’t.

Maybe we should count it as a blessing that, after a four-decade journey back from the brink, New York as a whole has, for what may be a very brief moment between recessions and terror attacks, the luxury of worrying about small things.

On a recent trip home to Brooklyn on the F train, for instance, I spotted a poster sponsored by the Office of the Mayor. “Midnight Snack,” the message read, over a close-up of a raccoon’s masked face. “Like all New Yorkers, raccoons know where to find a good meal. Please don’t feed NYC’s night life.”

Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil’s operations there. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.

Mr. Ross emerges as a particularly valued client for the offshore law firm, whose records provide more insight into his financial holdings beyond the public ethics disclosures he made upon joining the Trump administration. His ethics agreement filed in January listed the partnerships he intended to keep, but not the investments they held. Previously, Navigator had been mentioned in a separate, 57-page description of his holdings for the year that ended in December 2016, but with no hint of its ties to Sibur.

Sibur’s top ownership — including Gennady Timchenko, who is Mr. Putin’s friend and judo partner and is subject to American sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, who is married to the Russian president’s youngest daughter — makes it “a company with crony connections” in Moscow, said Daniel Fried, a Russia expert who served in senior State Department posts in Republican and Democratic administrations.

Another of Navigator’s major customers is PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company, controlled by the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on PDVSA this summer.

In a written response to questions by the Times, James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, said that Navigator’s relationship with Sibur began before Mr. Ross joined the board in March 2012, and that he had never met the Russian oligarchs who are Sibur’s major shareholders. Public records show that Mr. Ross’s firm became a major investor in Navigator in November 2011, three months before the company chartered its first ships to Sibur.

“Sibur was not under sanctions at the time the contract was signed and is still not subject to sanctions,” Mr. Rockas said.

More broadly, he said that Mr. Ross “recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration’s sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities.”

“Secretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption,” Mr. Rockas said, “and he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards.”

It is perhaps unsurprising that Navigator would have a relationship with a major Russian company during Mr. Ross’s tenure. Much like President Trump, whose company sought approval for a hotel project in Moscow as recently as last year, Mr. Ross has long shown an appreciation for the untapped potential of Russian markets when seeking investment opportunities. His involvement there dates at least to the 1990s, when he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund, established to promote American business interests in Russia.

In addition to Navigator, his firm also acquired a German rail car company, VTG, which pursued an expansion strategy in Russia before Mr. Ross sold his stake in 2016. And Mr. Ross led a private bailout of the Bank of Cyprus, long regarded as a favorite financial haven of wealthy Russians, after the worldwide economic crisis crippled the Cypriot banking system.

In the wake of reports of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, multiple investigations have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of the Trump administration. While several Trump campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior administration officials and members of Mr. Putin’s family or inner circle.

During Mr. Ross’s confirmation process, he was asked repeatedly about his business ties to Russia, mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he dealt with Russian investors but also forced some of them out of the bank. He was also asked about his investment in another shipping company, Diamond S, and whether its dealings with China could pose a conflict with his government duties. But he faced no questions about Navigator and its significant financial relationship with Sibur.

Mr. Rockas did not respond to questions about the current status of Mr. Ross’s investment. If Mr. Ross stands to benefit, albeit indirectly, from a Russian firm controlled by members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, it poses a potential conflict with his role as the lead cabinet member on trade policy, ethics experts said. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and has emerged as a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said that while Mr. Ross’s continued investment in Navigator would not violate any laws, it created other ethical concerns.

“Apart from those legal issues,” Mr. Painter said, “I’d be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians.”

As for Navigator, its leadership sees blue skies ahead with one of its key investors now at the helm of American trade policy.

On Nov. 30 of last year, hours after being nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross celebrated at Gramercy Tavern, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, at an event hosted by Navigator. He and David J. Butters, Navigator’s chief executive, arrived early to a private room and had a chat.

“Your interest is aligned to mine,” Mr. Butters recalls Mr. Ross saying, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. “The U.S. economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.”

Looking East

Mr. Ross’s foray into transoceanic shipping took off in 2011, when his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., assembled teams of investors to acquire major stakes in Diamond S Shipping and Navigator Holdings. Both firms specialized in chartering tankers to petroleum companies that need to move gas, oil and petrochemicals around the world. With Mr. Ross’s involvement, they would expand their business interests in China and Russia.

The investments — eventually totaling more than $600 million in Diamond S and about $240 million in Navigator — were in keeping with Mr. Ross’s strategy of scooping up shares in undervalued companies and turning them around. It is a business model that has earned Mr. Ross, a 79-year-old Ivy League-educated son of middle-class parents from New Jersey, the sobriquet of “king of bankruptcy.”

Over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the British banking firm Rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at Rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering Trump casinos in Atlantic City, preserving a stake for Mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the Trump name was “still very much an asset.”

Mr. Ross’s business practices have occasionally drawn criticism for moving American jobs overseas in an effort to improve profits. A Reuters analysis of Labor Department statistics found that his takeovers shifted 2,700 jobs in automotive, textiles and mortgage finance to, among other places, China, India, Mexico and Nicaragua.

In the statement to The Times, Mr. Ross’s spokesman said, “Private equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and Secretary Ross has decades of experience that he is now using to benefit American workers.”

As worldwide shipping concerns, Diamond S and Navigator did not have much of a labor footprint in the United States when Mr. Ross and his investors took over. But the way both companies did business would pose potential conflicts with American interests in other ways.

Alongside Mr. Ross, another large investor in Diamond S was a company controlled by the Chinese government, according to securities filings. And Navigator signed a charter agreement with Sibur shortly after Mr. Ross’s firm made its investment. Sibur said in a statement that any negotiations with Navigator over the years were carried out by its executives, not its major shareholders, and that “no meetings were held with Mr. Ross.”

Initially, Navigator chartered two vessels to Sibur, and later increased the fleet to four. The relationship proved to be so profitable that Navigator’s chief executive, Mr. Butters, told investors in a 2016 conference call how Navigator benefited as Sibur beat out American competitors in the growing European energy market.

“Russia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into Europe, and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts, all in competition with longer-haul U.S. exports,” Mr. Butters said.

Putin Connections

As one of the largest gas companies in Russia, Sibur is not just any private business.

It was created by the Russian government and maintains a close dependency on Moscow, even after its sale in 2010 to Mr. Timchenko and Leonid Mikhelson. The two men are typical of Russian moguls who have benefited from state-owned assets and are expected to remain loyal to the Putin government, said Amos J. Hochstein, a top energy diplomat under the Obama administration.

Photo

“When you start doing business with Russian energy companies like Gazprom and Sibur, you’re not just getting into bed with the company,” Mr. Hochstein said. “You’re getting into bed with the Russian state.”

The ties to the Russian president, however, proved to be a double-edged sword for Sibur’s owners. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, American and Western allies imposed economic sanctions on key Putin associates, including Mr. Timchenko. A few months later, the United States barred banks from providing new financing to another gas company, Novatek, belonging to Mr. Mikhelson.

Sibur itself was not targeted. But financial institutions, including Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland, backed away from loans to the company, according to news reports at the time. Moscow stepped in to help in May 2014, when a government-backed financial consortium bought a shipping terminal from Sibur and pledged to expand export capacity, while allowing Sibur to remain the terminal’s sole exporter of gas.

Then, in September 2014, as sanctions pressure was growing, Mr. Timchenko reduced his holdings in Sibur by selling a 17 percent stake to a junior shareholder, Mr. Shamalov. A year earlier, Mr. Shamalov, whose father is a friend and former business partner of Mr. Putin’s, had married the Russian president’s daughter Katerina. His Sibur purchase, which pushed the 32-year-old Mr. Shamalov’s investment to more than 20 percent of the company, was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from the state-backed Gazprombank. Mr. Shamalov sold part of his stake in April, reducing it to 3.9 percent.

Most of these financial machinations were carried out through offshore companies on Cyprus, where Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko held their investments in Sibur and did business with several Cypriot banks. During the summer of 2014, Mr. Ross had become the Bank of Cyprus’s vice chairman, though there is no indication that he crossed paths with the two oligarchs during his tenure there.

His position at the bank required him to step down from the board of Navigator, however, even as he retained his investment in the company. His close associate at WL Ross & Co., Wendy L. Teramoto, took his place at Navigator and, later, left to join Mr. Ross as chief of staff at the Commerce Department.

Despite the reluctance of Western financial institutions to do business with Sibur and its owners, Navigator’s relationship with Sibur continued to grow.

From 2014 to 2015, the portion of Navigator’s total revenue that came from Sibur jumped to 9.1 percent from 5.3 percent, making the company one of its top five clients, according to securities filings, before dipping to 7.9 percent last year.

Ethics Disclosures

As WL Ross & Co. expanded over the years, it used Appleby, the offshore specialist, to set up an increasing number of entities in tax havens, many in the Cayman Islands. This British territory in the Caribbean levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction, and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. By 2014, Mr. Ross and his investment company were among Appleby’s top 20 clients.

After he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross filed an agreement with the federal Office of Government Ethics saying he would resign from WL Ross & Co. and divest from 80 companies and partnerships, but would keep a stake in nine others that held assets in “real estate financing and mortgage lending” and “transoceanic shipping.” The underlying assets were not specified.

Photo

His financial disclosure form offered more detail, including a list of assets that had been held by each of the partnerships that he retained. Navigator Holdings appeared in connection with four Appleby-managed Cayman partnerships. Mr. Ross’s ethics filing valued his stake in those partnerships at between $2.05 million and $10.1 million, a fraction of the partnerships’ combined 31.5 percent stake in Navigator, which, based on the firm’s recent stock price, was worth roughly $179 million. In all, WL Ross & Co. remains Navigator’s largest shareholder, according to the shipping company’s most recent annual report.

Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have “a direct and predictable” effect on their financial interests or cause a reasonable doubt about their impartiality. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his continued business holdings and his cabinet post.

After the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Coates reminds us, the initial popular reaction was mournful and respectful — it was only after Obama offered the mildest of identifications with the dead child (“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon”) that negative responses flooded the airways. White people posted pictures of themselves “Trayvoning”: wearing hoodies and pretending to be dead with a package of Skittles. Rather than ushering in a post-racial paradise, Coates writes, the election of Obama became a rallying cry for racists and “effectively racialized white Americans’ views, even of health care policy.” The fear has now become a formula, and “Fear of a Black President,” which was published in the fall of 2012, now feels like both prophecy and jeremiad. (A small criticism: The book doesn’t clearly provide these original publication dates in the text itself, making the exact timing hard to parse.)

In Coates’s essays from the early years of the Obama administration, he regularly identifies a conservatism that black culture often aligns with but that outsiders find hard to name. There is, in fact, another unrealized book here, one in which Coates would have traced this tradition as he started to in an early essay on Bill Cosby. Thankfully he didn’t — instead, the prologues introducing each year often serve as retrospectives, letting him amend the record; with Cosby, Coates says he should have made more of “the torrent of rape allegations that swirled around him even then,” missing a chance to point out the hypocrisy of Cosby’s moralizing “call-outs” about the black community. Coates senses a strain of “the organic black conservative tradition” in both Malcolm X and Obama, calling the former president “a conservative revolutionary” and comparing him to Booker T. Washington. This feels a bit too simplistic. In reality Obama complicates any genealogy of radicals or reactionaries, just as Coates rewrites the narrative of being a public intellectual.

At the start of Coates’s own “two terms,” he is writing in Harlem while living check to check, hoping to give his young family stability; by the following year, he has been invited to attend the Aspen Ideas Festival. The leap seems both unexplained and now inevitable, with the book’s episodic form letting Coates gloss over such gaps. Still, the emotional journey he does detail feels real, and realized. “It is, I think, the very chaos of America that allowed me to prosper,” he writes in “Notes From the Eighth Year.” “I suspect, though I do not know, that the lack of both ceilings and safety nets is how we got a black president. I suspect it is how, at least for these eight years, I came to thrive.”

Always passionate, the essays grow increasingly precise. With “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” Coates found not so much his subject as a language for it. He starts to quote historians to show where we’ve been; makes regular reference to Reconstruction and the regression and receding of the American dream; invokes the demonization of “super-predators” and Sistah Souljah — all with elegance and insight. His is one of the chorus of voices (following, I’d argue, those of our poets) critiquing not only American nostalgia, both black and white, but the very notion of progress.

It is the record of his struggle as a writer that is of great interest here. As in Baldwin, the struggle of the writing dovetails with the struggle of the race. This becomes clearest in his 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations,” which became Coates’s calling card, and rightly so: It provides a remarkable pocket history of the financial toll of white supremacy, from disenfranchisement to land grabs to redlining, offering a harrowing account of the economic injustices imposed on African-Americans. Framed by one man’s moving from Mississippi to Chicago during the Great Migration only to encounter the same-old systematic shafting in what we used to call “Up South,” it isn’t cross-burning but the slow burn of oppression that makes the blood boil. Compelling and compulsory, “The Case for Reparations” is as convincing in its restraint and pacing as it is in its depth of research and recognition of black humanity. Even if readers don’t see their own families, as I did, in the tales of the Federal Housing Administration’s discriminatory practices or the “kleptocracy” of black-owned land “taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism,” we can see the forms of injustice that persist and speak to basic rights: Where can one live? Indeed, who gets to live?

“Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred,” Coates points out. “It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.” He also highlights the effect of racist policies on the polity — and just how “plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient,” affecting everything from subprime mortgages to mandatory minimum sentencing. This story is now one that others are telling more fully — books like Carol Anderson’s “White Rage” and Ibram X. Kendi’s “Stamped From the Beginning” help detail the history of reactions to and restrictions of black advances — yet few have done it more succinctly than Coates, or with more power: “What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.”

Obama remains an important foil for Coates, one he fruitfully returns to with “My President Was Black,” a feature begun before the 2016 election (and published after) that shows Coates’s new status — he is now a regular enough White House visitor that he scores an extensive interview — while foreshadowing the ways both men underestimated the opposition, if for different reasons. To Coates, and to many, Obama “became a symbol of black people’s everyday, extraordinary Americanness”; but where Obama’s blindness to Trump’s electoral victory stems, Coates believes, from Obama’s essential optimism, for Coates, any unseeing came from a well-earned pessimism: “I was shocked at my own shock.”

The election of President Obama inspired not only Coates but, as he points out, “a crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during his two terms.” The undeniable black renaissance in poetry and cinema, from documentaries like “I Am Not Your Negro” to horror films like “Get Out,” has been met by fellow adventurers in the essay, from Teju Cole to Jesmyn Ward to Kiese Laymon to Roxane Gay. Obama also embodies a phrase that might serve as an alternative subtitle of “Eight Years,” since it appears so often: Being Twice as Good. This phrase is simultaneously the injunction black families have had to give their progeny in a world redlined against them, while also being the very idea that Coates examines as an unjust “double standard.” It is this double standard, he argues, that brought about President Trump: “Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that in working twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump’s counter is persuasive — work half as hard as black people and even more is possible.”

As Coates turns the heat lower, his brilliance cooks more evenly — and more urgently. Never is this more true than in “The First White President,” his recent cover story for the Atlantic. The essay, presented here as an epilogue, manages to be as bloodless as it is blistering. Coates rebukes those on the left who try to pawn Trump off “as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning.” To Coates, Trump’s “ideology is white supremacy in all of its truculent and sanctimonious power”; to pretend otherwise is to treat “white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else.”

If there’s anything to critique in Coates, it is that for him black autobiography — the story black folks tell themselves and sometimes others — is chiefly trauma. There is another, blues-based tradition, embodied by the likes of the poet Lucille Clifton or Zora Neale Hurston — an ethos that is often as Southern, countrified and womanist as Coates’s vision is Northern, urban and male — which, while forgoing easy optimism, sees black life as a secret pleasure, or at least sees joy, however hard-earned, as “an act of resistance.” (The depiction of joy is from the poet Toi Derricotte; Clifton used to inscribe her books with “Joy!,” which I always took not as balm but challenge.) Coates means to address this when he says that black cultural identity offers “the balm for such trauma,” yet he insists “it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.” Hurston would offer something else: “Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world — I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.” Her declaration, suffused with a blues aesthetic, even rhymes.

For Coates, his tragic view is usefully defiant: “Our story is a tragedy. I know it sounds odd, but that belief does not depress me. It focuses me.” Coates’s book brings us to a boil, then lets us simmer, and anyone who wants to know who we are — and where we are now — must sit with him for a good while. “Eight Years” confirms why Coates is enjoying his extended moment, while also pulling back the curtain on all the hard work that preceded and produced his success. It should inspire us as writers, and as Americans, that he urges us, in exile or online, to become better — or at least clearer on why we’re not.",Between the Presidency and Him,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/books/review/we-were-eight-years-in-power-ta-nehisi-coates-essays-memoir.html

On Monday, the latest round of post-Paris international climate talks begin in Bonn, Germany, to discuss how to step up efforts.

Under the Paris deal, each country put forward a proposal to curtail its greenhouse-gas emissions between now and 2030. But no major industrialized country is currently on track to fulfill its pledge, according to new data from the Climate Action Tracker. Not the European Union. Not Canada. Not Japan. And not the United States, which under President Trump is still planning to leave the Paris agreement by 2020.

Worse, even if governments do take further steps to meet their individual pledges, the world will still be on pace to warm well in excess of 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the threshold that world leaders vowed to avoid in Paris because they deemed it unacceptably risky.

“One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Program.

United States

Even before the election of Mr. Trump, the goal set by former President Barack Obama of slashing United States emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 would have been difficult to hit. While emissions from the United States power sector are falling rapidly — as hundreds of coal plants retire in favor of cleaner natural gas, wind and solar — other sectors, like transportation and heavy industry, have proven harder to clean up.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has disavowed his predecessor’s pledge and is dismantling Obama-era regulations designed to push down emissions further, such as the Clean Power Plan. And while states like New York and California are still pursuing their own policies on renewable energy and electric vehicles, they may not prove sufficient to close the gap.

For now, analysts think the United States will fall well short of its Paris pledge. That, in turn, could make it harder for future administrations to pursue the deeper emissions cuts by mid-century needed to help keep the world below 2 degrees of global warming.

Climate Action Tracker provides a rough estimate of the cuts each country would need to make to avoid 2ºC of warming, with wealthier nations expected to do more. How to divide up the burden remains a major debate within climate talks.

European Union

The E.U. may fall slightly short of its promise to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. While European officials have created a continent-wide cap-and-trade system to curb emissions from electricity and heavy industry, that regulation leaves out sectors like transportation and agriculture.

Progress among individual European countries has been mixed: Over the past two years, Britain has been rapidly phasing out coal power, aided by a national carbon tax and cheap natural gas. But Germany is expected to miss its near-term emissions goals, as recent rapid growth in renewables has been partly offset by the closure of nuclear power plants.

China

Outside experts say that China crafted a Paris pledge that was relatively easy to meet: overall emissions would peak around 2030 and the country would get 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil sources.

Several recent studies suggest that China’s emissions could now peak years ahead of schedule as the country’s once-insatiable demand for energy has slowed (though other analysts have questioned the accuracy of China’s emissions reporting). The central government has already canceled plans for a hundred coal plants and is investing heavily in cleaner sources like solar, wind, and nuclear. The country also plans to sell millions of electric vehicles in the years ahead.

Yet keeping the world below 2 degrees of warming would likely require China’s coal emissions not just to flatten, but to fall sharply by 2030.

India

Because India is still relatively poor, with 240 million of its citizens lacking access to electricity, the nation has long argued that wealthier countries should take the lead on cutting emissions.

As such, India’s pledge was less restrictive than pledges from Europe or the United States. The country vowed to install more clean energy and improve its carbon intensity — the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of gross domestic product — while still allowing total emissions to rise between now and 2030. India’s per capita emissions would likely remain below those of China or the United States.

Some recent studies have suggested that India can achieve those modest goals, as the falling cost of renewables and shifting market conditions have allowed the country to scale back its plans for new coal plants after 2022. A recent report from the U.N. Environment Program argued that India had “ample room” to strengthen its emission pledges — as would likely be necessary to help keep the world below 2 degrees of warming. But the Indian government has asked for aid from wealthier countries to do so.

What happens next in climate talks?

Negotiators will meet in Bonn this month to discuss guidelines for making national pledges and policies more transparent, so that outsiders can gauge individual countries’ progress (or lack thereof) more precisely.

In 2018, climate negotiators plan to embark on a major effort to assess the world’s progress on climate change to date and measure it against the 2 degree goal. Countries can then revise their individual climate pledges accordingly — and will do so every five years thereafter.

Right now, many of the Paris pledges remain fairly opaque, and most nations have been vague on what specific policies they will take to meet them. There is no official mechanism for quantifying progress. As a result, groups like Climate Action Tracker have had to make rough estimates as to whether nations are on pace to meet their pledges — and how much further each country would need to go for the world to stay below 2 degrees of global warming.

Increasing the transparency of pledges would make it easier for countries to pressure each other do more, which is how the Paris Agreement was designed, said David Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego.",Here’s How Far the World Is From Meeting Its Climate Goals,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

Photo“Whoever is president has to genuinely want to work with Sunil, because that’s the only way we can bring U.S. Soccer forward,” Martino said.
But whether Sunil runs again or not, my motivation will always be to protect U.S. Soccer from a president not capable of fixing our soccer problems.
But he’s admitted he’s not a soccer guy, and he’s saying he’s going to hire the soccer guy.
“I just got to the point where I felt I had to serve — I had to take the leap,” Martino said.","“When a club in England is failing and they’re in jeopardy of going into administration and disappearing, fans, former players, business people — they all get together with their time, experiences and resources with the sole purpose of saving a club they love. We need to do that with U.S. Soccer.

Photo

“We need a group, to step up and say, ‘Enough is enough, we’re here to save this thing.’ I can mobilize that group.”

After having worked the weekend in his usual studio role, as the lone American on NBC’s team of Premier League broadcasters, Martino, 36, is leaving the network immediately to begin traveling the country to build out his consortium and learn to “speak every language of the U.S. soccer community” in advance of the federation’s election on Feb. 10. Candidates have until Dec. 12 to announce their intention to run and submit the required nominations.

Martino is the third prominent ex-U.S. player to announce his intention to run for the presidency, joining his fellow broadcaster Eric Wynalda and the two-time World Cup veteran Paul Caligiuri, who scored the 1989 goal that ended a 40-year absence for the United States from soccer’s biggest event and started a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.

But Martino’s profile could make him the biggest threat to Gulati, who has held the position since 2006. Gulati coasted to victory unopposed in the last three elections, but the entry into the race last week of his longtime aide, the U.S. Soccer executive vice president Carlos Cordeiro, led many to wonder whether that was a signal that Gulati, 58, would opt not to run.

Gulati, who holds a seat on the governing council of FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, and serves as chairman of the United States’ joint bid for the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, has been cagey about whether he will enter the race. But his connections, built over three decades in the federation, would make him a formidable opponent should he decide to run.

The election for president of U.S. Soccer is not so much a popularity contest as it is a coalition-building proposition. U.S. Soccer’s president is elected in a vote of representatives of its various councils: 25 percent shares for the youth, adult and pro councils; 20 percent to an athletes council; and the rest to a small group that includes board members, life members and even a fan representative.

Even as he began his campaign to supplant him, Martino stressed that he wants to work “in lock step” with Gulati in the future, despite the fact that he was one of the loudest voices calling for Gulati’s resignation after a 2-1 defeat at Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 10 eliminated the Americans from next summer’s World Cup in Russia.

“Whoever is president has to genuinely want to work with Sunil, because that’s the only way we can bring U.S. Soccer forward,” Martino said. “Sunil has gotten us a seat at the head table. But whether Sunil runs again or not, my motivation will always be to protect U.S. Soccer from a president not capable of fixing our soccer problems. Who we need right now is secondary to what we need, which is a soccer vision.

“Carlos entering the race raises the quality of the candidates. But he’s admitted he’s not a soccer guy, and he’s saying he’s going to hire the soccer guy. I’m saying the complete opposite. I am the soccer guy. And hiring the business guy is a lot easier when that part of the company is working so well.

“The first thing people are going to say when they see that I’ve come forward is, ‘What does he know about running a $100 million company?’ But the business side of U.S. soccer is thriving. We don’t need an M.B.A. right now. We need a soccer Ph.D. And that’s what I have.”

Martino said he would run on a three-pronged blueprint that he is calling “The Progress Plan,” which he spells out on his campaign website, everyonesgameusa.com, which went live Monday morning. Martino said he intends to keep building upon the plan, in part through his listening tour but also via a national soccer summit he is hoping to convene soon in New York.

The three pillars of Martino’s plan are:

■ Transparency. Chief among his goals are commissioning an outside audit to study “the ethics of how U.S. Soccer is being run” and to make the position of federation president a full-time, paid post. Martino said one of his initial motivations in publicly declaring that he would not run recently was to highlight the fact that the position is currently unpaid, because that “creates a barrier for entry to qualified candidates.”

■ Equality. A prime area of concern for Martino, he said, is youth players who are being priced out of the game by the financial barriers they encounter, but also players at all levels who feel “unsafe” in locker rooms and what he calls “the mistreatment of our female athletes.”

“Our women are World Cup winners,” Martino said. “Why are they playing on artificial surfaces? Why are they sleeping in beds with bed bugs? Why aren’t they paid the same as the men? And if you look at the U.S. soccer structure, why don’t women have positions of influence? There are no good answers to these questions.”

■ Progress. Martino wants to enact new standards to measure it and to create centers throughout the country to foster it by teaching a curriculum “aggregated from some of the business soccer academies around the world” — for free — to the top youth players in the sport after casting “a wider net” find more prospects that the current system is missing. He also wants to assemble an advisory board of former players, top coaches and representatives from a variety of levels to make recommendations to the president on major decisions, such as hiring the head coach or technical director for the men’s national team.

Martino said he had the backing of several well-known men and women in American soccer but was not yet prepared to reveal names because he wants “to make sure these people are not marginalized or punished for aligning themselves with a candidate.”

But to illustrate the sort of reach he has with influencers in the game, Martino, a former rookie of the year in Major League Soccer, provided The New York Times with letters of recommendation he has received from David Beckham and Thierry Henry, arguably the two most famous imports in M.L.S. history.

“I have support from high-profile U.S. players, but I’ve asked them not to back me publicly to protect them from the potential political retribution Thierry and David are immune to,” Martino said.

Other candidates who have publicly declared their intention to run include the Boston lawyer Steve Gans; the soccer administrator Paul Lapointe; and the New York lawyer Michael Winograd, who played professionally in Israel.

Martino, whose unpaid hiatus began Monday, said NBC would invite him to return to his broadcasting role in the event he does not win the February election. He said he would start a fund-raising drive to finance his campaign, and that he will promptly sell his minority share in the Spanish third division club Real Mallorca to its majority owner Robert Sarver, who also owns the Phoenix Suns.

“I just got to the point where I felt I had to serve — I had to take the leap,” Martino said. “I had a conversation with my wife in our kitchen, which went into the wee hours of the morning, and I told her I won’t be able to forgive myself if I don’t stand up for U.S. Soccer right now.

“I didn’t dream of doing this job, but I know I have to do it. And if Feb. 10 comes and goes and I’m not the president of U.S. Soccer, I can promise that whoever is, I will make sure that, if they beat me, they have soccer’s best interests at heart.

If an amalgam of McCarthyism and the notorious Willie Horton ad suits your taste, then you want to get hold of a mailer sent to Long Island voters on behalf of the Republican candidate for Nassau County executive. As odious campaign material goes, this one is hard to beat. Yet the candidate, Jack Martins, says he firmly stands by it.

The mailer shows three shirtless Latino men, covered in tattoos and representing MS-13, the vicious gang begun by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles that now menaces Long Island. “Meet Your New Neighbors!” a headline above them says, adding this about Mr. Martins’s Democratic opponent: “Laura Curran will roll out the welcome mat for violent gangs like MS-13!” Ms. Curran, the text says, is “MS-13’s choice for county executive.”

That was the Willie Horton part of the message — a blatant race-based appeal to fear. You may recall the Horton commercial, which the elder George Bush ran in his 1988 presidential campaign. It showed a black man who had raped a white woman and assaulted her husband while free on a Massachusetts prison-furlough program that was supported by Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate. As a vote magnet, it worked for Mr. Bush. Mr. Martins, a former state senator, clearly hopes it does the same for him in Tuesday’s election.

Now for the McCarthyism: “Laura Curran’s campaign is supported and funded by New York City special interest groups.” This is an attempted smear reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy’s heyday, with its suggestion that Ms. Curran shares the views of unnamed groups that “want to make Nassau County a sanctuary county for illegal immigrants.” It’s the old guilt by association.

In fact, Ms. Curran, a county legislator, supports neither sanctuary counties nor sanctuary cities, terms typically applied to localities whose police forces are ordered not to ask about the immigration status of people taken into custody. “It makes MS-13 look like a PAC that’s supporting me,” she said, understandably offended.","Willie Horton, Updated for the Trump Era",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/opinion/jack-martins-long-island-ad.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“We don’t trust,” said Ms. Weaver, a psychologist who had never before held elected office.
Far from intimidating voters, Ms. Weaver said, the police were investigating allegations that people had been duped into signing recall petitions.
“Mayor Weaver won’t be for the people,” said one candidate, Arthur Woodson, who accused of her corruption and of using the water crisis for political gain.
Though their posts are officially nonpartisan, Ms. Weaver and the City Council members are Democrats.","“The mayor is trying to turn this into a racial campaign, and it has nothing to do with me being white and her being an African-American female,” said Scott Kincaid, a longtime city councilman and labor-union employee who is widely considered the main challenger in the recall. “It has to do with her inability to govern the City of Flint.”

It has been more than three years since a state-appointed emergency manager made a cost-saving switch in Flint’s drinking water source, which led to discoloration, lead poisoning and a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. As the scope of the contamination was becoming clear, Ms. Weaver defeated the incumbent mayor in 2015 by staking her campaign on solving the water crisis and promising to bring in resources to help residents.

Life and politics remain upended here by the water. Many Flint residents, including Ms. Weaver, still use bottled water to drink and to brush their teeth, even though tests show the tap water is improving.

“We don’t trust,” said Ms. Weaver, a psychologist who had never before held elected office. “Something that’s difficult to re-establish is trust, when you’ve been lied to at every level of government.”

Ms. Weaver inherited a city that had struggled long before the water turned toxic. About half as many people live here now as when the auto industry was booming, and 41 percent of the 97,000 current residents live in poverty. Flint’s murder rate is consistently among the country’s worst.

Over the years, voters in this heavily Democratic city have blamed politicians for some of that decline, successfully recalling one mayor and attempting to oust others. Michigan governors have been criticized for sending in emergency managers to run Flint and take control away from local leaders elected by residents. In one sure sign of disgust with the entire political system, a pet pig named Giggles made national news here in 2015 as a write-in candidate for mayor, a mock campaign rooted in dissatisfaction with the human options.

Ms. Weaver’s opponents say she has further tainted the public’s perception of city government. Among their grievances: Her attempt to do business with a trash-collection company that has been accused of corruption elsewhere; the lack of working relationships with Council members; and a long-running dispute about where Flint should get its drinking water in the future and how much residents should pay.

“There’s been a constant, general incompetence,” said Kate Fields, a City Council member who is supporting Mr. Kincaid in the recall. Ms. Fields has accused the Weaver administration of corruption and complained to the state about her campaign practices.

Stirring intense debate, Flint police officers have knocked on the doors of people whose names appeared on recall petitions against Ms. Weaver to ask if they had in fact signed the document. The county clerk, John Gleason, who certified the petitions, called that “voter intimidation and harassment.”

Ms. Weaver denied any wrongdoing and said the criticisms were politically motivated. Far from intimidating voters, Ms. Weaver said, the police were investigating allegations that people had been duped into signing recall petitions.

“I guess if the police are investigating you, they’re going to show up at your house, at your job,” said Ms. Weaver, who filed and later dropped a lawsuit challenging the validity of the recall. “They were just doing their job.”

Ms. Weaver said her two years in office have been marked by progress in the midst of crisis. She points to state and federal disaster assistance funding, a fire station that reopened, new businesses downtown and a city-led effort to replace tainted pipes. So far, more than 5,200 houses have had pipes replaced.

Eric Mays, the mayor’s only consistent ally on the City Council, said Ms. Weaver has done well and that some of her opposition seems rooted in jealousy about her national fame. “Everybody is trying to be in the news, and they’ve kind of lost focus,” he said.

Others see it differently. At a forum last month at the Flint Public Library, a parade of mayoral hopefuls blasted Ms. Weaver’s policies; her collaboration with Rick Snyder, the Republican governor of Michigan; and her handling of the water crisis. “Mayor Weaver won’t be for the people,” said one candidate, Arthur Woodson, who accused of her corruption and of using the water crisis for political gain.

City Council members supporting Mr. Kincaid accused Ms. Weaver of injecting race into the campaign in a city where about 55 percent of residents are African-American and where votes have long been cast along racial lines. Though their posts are officially nonpartisan, Ms. Weaver and the City Council members are Democrats.

“I don’t like the fact that they came in playing the race-card game,” said Wantwaz Davis, a City Council member who is black and who signed the recall petition. “It’s not about blacks against whites.”

Mr. Gleason, the county clerk, said he was afraid that the recall had only exacerbated a long-festering sense in Flint that the political system is broken, that elections do not matter and that votes do not count. He predicted “a very dismal turnout” on Tuesday, perhaps around 13 percent of eligible voters.","Flint Mayor, Ushered in to Fix Water Crisis, Now Faces Recall",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/flint-mayor-karen-weaver-recall-water.html

Wheatcroft was using new technology that had not been tested in a race. He understood that many things could go wrong. The metal girders of bridges along the course scrambled the digital compass on his iPhone. He worried about other possible navigational glitches caused by Bluetooth interference.

What if someone stopped in front of him to take a selfie? How would he refill his water bottle? Could he remain on course as the race turned off Fifth Avenue and funneled into Central Park at Mile 24, curling around the reservoir, which had seemed to befuddle his GPS on some test runs?

He had used technology, such as Runkeeper, an app that gave his pace and distance with voice commands. But corrective navigation for visually impaired runners was in its infancy. As Sunday’s race approached, Wheatcroft described himself as excited, nervous, a little fearful.

“It’s a complicated course, there’s a lot of people, you can’t afford to make mistakes,” he said. “Reaction times need to be sharp.”

His biggest concern, he said, was correctly interpreting the patterns of vibrations on his arm and chest. If he became confused, he planned to do what marathon runners often did in times of stress: slow down.

Wheatcroft was a seasoned distance runner, having completed the Boston Marathon three times and ultramarathons as long as 83 miles. In 2014, he ran from Boston to New York as a warm-up, then ran the New York City Marathon. He hoped to finish in four and a half hours on Sunday, more than 40 minutes faster than his previous best in New York.

Wheatcroft and Kevin Yoo, one of three founders of WearWorks, had been testing the Wayband technology since April. As with any prototypes, there were advances and setbacks. On Friday afternoon in Central Park, and again Saturday, last-minute refining continued with the chest sensor.

Keith Kirkland, another founder of WearWorks, joked about running along the course during the race and calling out, “Anyone have a soldering iron?”

On Sunday, Yoo started his first marathon, hoping to accompany Wheatcroft for as long as he could. The Wayband device was turned off for the first two miles of the race on the ascent and descent of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Too many runners packed together. Too much risk of technological overload.

“Could we ask everyone to be considerate and please not use their cellphones?” Yoo joked before the race.

Crosswinds blowing over the chest sensor gave confusing signals to Wheatcroft on the bridge, but the roadway was wide and he had plenty of open space to run. Neil Bacon, a friend who has often accompanied Wheatcroft, reminded him not to get too exuberant.

“You’re doing 26 miles,” Bacon said. “Don’t go off like it’s a half-marathon.”

At the first water stop, about two and a half miles into the race, a guide for another runner stopped in front of Wheatcroft. His chest sensor was set to alert him when an obstacle was seven feet away. He did not have enough time to stop and clipped the woman from behind, but neither was hurt. At the second water stop, he slowed and moved to the center of the road.

Just after Mile 3, the Wayband device signaled incorrectly that Wheatcroft was headed in the wrong direction. He stopped and walked for a minute, then renewed his pace. Tall and thin, wearing a white cap on his shaved head, he had run four miles without any assistance.

Taking in the aromatic scents of late-morning cooking in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Wheatcroft said, “I could run this thing on smell.”

But he would have to be prepared if his digital compass went haywire later in the race — while on the Pulaski Bridge at the halfway point, the Queensboro Bridge between Miles 15 and 16 or the Willis Avenue Bridge at Mile 20 — and the vibrations from his armband signaled incorrectly that he was veering off course.",Blind Runner’s Wearable Technology Gets Off to Complicated Start,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/sports/blind-marathoner-technology.html

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Ms. Weiss called New York “the linchpin” that put our country on the path to pass the 19th Amendment in 1920, granting women across the United States the right to vote.

A century later, the work continues.

“All of these issues we’re dealing with now — voter suppression and voter rights and racial bigotry — they all come up in the fight for suffragists,” Ms. Weiss added. “It’s a lesson for today; it’s not just history.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

Photo

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

My parents were immigrants who came to America with virtually nothing, and after I finished law school, I owed more than $100,000 in student loans.

There’s a reason many people feel it’s harder to afford children now than in previous generations. It’s true. According to federal data adjusted for inflation, from 1960 to 2015 the average annual cost of raising a child in a middle-income family rose by over $11,000. It’s now estimated that middle-class parents will spend more than $230,000 over the course of their son or daughter’s childhood — and that doesn’t even include college tuition.

Ask just about any couple and they’ll tell you this absolutely influences their decisions about when to have children and how many to have. As the economist Lyman Stone has shown, by 2012, the average number of children American women intended to have was 2.37, and the total fertility rate was 1.88 — a gap of about 0.5 children on average. Since the 1960s, there has been a consistent gap between intended and total fertility, even as the number of children American women desire to have and the total birthrate have declined over time.

There are many causes for this gap, but the increasing cost of childbearing clearly has played a role in its development. For example, think of families who delayed having children for a few years until they were more financially stable and may not have been able to have as many as they initially wanted. Or parents who wanted more children, but after their first or second realized they couldn’t afford the combined cost of taking care of the child and reducing their work hours. The German economist Anna Raute has isolated this “opportunity cost” of childbearing as a significant factor in fertility decisions.

Tax reform is a key part of reinvigorating the American dream so that couples have the flexibility to choose how to best start and raise a family. The status quo means the cost of having children makes those choices for them, resulting in smaller families, riskier pregnancies, longer commutes from more affordable exurbs and more missed recitals.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

You now have your marching orders. Go forth and find all three MTE REBUSes. One of them is at the crossing of 11D’s WISDOM TEETH and 30A’s ASSAM TEA.

(The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one’s body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don’t just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early ’90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation?

HISTORICALLY, CONSERVATIVE dressing is most frequently associated with religious adherence, which makes the most recent, trendier iteration of the phenomenon especially surprising — considering the kind of woman who is newly sheathing herself in long, baggy silhouettes is often the type of liberal nonbeliever who’d be the first to eschew any traditional strictures on her choices, sartorial or otherwise. Orthodox Jews follow the laws of tzniut (literally “modesty” in Hebrew), according to which the body of a woman — and her hair, too, if she’s married — should be substantively covered; observant Muslim women often wear a version of the hijab and loose-fitting, figure-obscuring clothing in public settings; and women in traditional Christian communities, from Amish to Mennonite, wear long dresses and, sometimes, some form of head covering. But whether one believes it’s a marker of outdated patriarchal coercion or a choice to be made by the devout woman herself, what seems clear is that this kind of dressing has until recently been seen as miles away from what a modern secular woman would want to wear.

This contradiction might be best embodied in the story of the lifestyle magazine Kinfolk — a publication that led the charge in advancing the kind of woodsy-hipster design-and-fashion aesthetic that has grown popular in America’s most liberal enclaves, from Silver Lake to Fort Greene, but that also has its roots in the Mormon upbringing of its founders, who established it in 2011 while attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. The humble, homespun spirit usually associated with retiring, self-enclosed communities of believers has been imported, not unlike the covered-up dressing trend, to an arena that feels largely alien to it, but that embraces its tenets — the handcrafted, the natural, the rustic — at least inasmuch as they can be marketed as a kind of soothing artisanal salve to the alienations of late-capitalist life.

SPEAKING TO some nonreligious women who tend to dress modestly, however, goes a way toward clarifying the style’s utility and function, as well as some of its inherent ambiguities. Thirty-two-year-old Hannah Hoffman, who runs her own eponymous gallery in Los Angeles, says she prefers figure-enshrouding outfits, mostly from Céline, to any other look. This is a matter of being both mobile and versatile — with her low heels and wide-cut pants, Hoffman told me, she can always jump up to grab an artwork or walk clients through her space — but the roots of her choices go deeper. “Everyone who’s involved on the commercial side of the art world is transacting on desire, for an object but also for an experience,” she said. “So you have to walk a very particular line in order to not dilute it, or misrepresent it, so people won’t get confused about what you’re selling them.” As a young woman helming her own business, this is a line that Hoffman feels she has to be careful not to cross, and she told me that rather than a more conventionally feminine aura, she prefers to project a “rigor and intellectual thoughtfulness” with her clothing choices. Commenting on the body-conscious silhouette prevalent among assistant-level gallery girls when she was starting in the art world in the mid-2000s, Hoffman noted how the power of a certain breed of male gallery owner had often seemed to her to be transacted through exactly such specters of young female sexuality, “and that’s not something you want to do.” Still, sometimes she wonders why she is the one who has to police the boundaries of appropriateness: Why is it, she said, that “if you wear a short skirt and a collector hits on you, it’s your fault?”

There is something dispiriting (though perhaps not surprising, considering, for one, who America elected for president) about the ongoing need to consider such questions — after at least three waves of feminism have asserted a woman’s right to self-determination over her own body, and, by extension, her clothing choices. Haven’t we realized by now that women not only shouldn’t be held responsible for men’s misreading of their cues, but that, moreover, they might come to see their bodies and sexuality as a source of power to be reveled in rather than guarded? (Certainly, another recent leaning in fashion — that toward body positivity and acceptance — has been championing exposing rather than obscuring bodies of all sizes.)

Still, Hoffman’s perspective is familiar and understandable: Being a woman, one needs to frequently assess others’ expectations over and against one’s own. As the 21-year-old actress, writer and editor Tavi Gevinson told me, the relative modesty — or lack thereof — of her clothing choices reflects more than her own individual preferences. If she’s going on an audition, she won’t dress in what she called “a frumpy art teacher look” (a look, as she joked during our conversation, that could also be called “Brooklyn mom” or “European baby”). Rather, “I would dress in something that makes my figure look nice, because people are stupid, and most of the time when they say, ‘We want her to come in again,’ what they really mean is ‘Wear something more conventionally attractive.’ ” In the publishing world, however, when Gevinson wants to be taken more seriously, as a thinker rather than a body, a dowdier look is helpful, so she can seem, she said, “as if I’ve somehow matured past a quote unquote juvenile desire to be perceived as a woman.” The formula, then, is flipped, but not in a way that’s necessarily more freeing.

THE STATE OF wanting to be looked at is often mingled with self-consciousness about that very desire. I’ve always thought that one of the reasons the “Little House on the Prairie” books continue to be popular with tween girls, many decades after they were first published, is that their presentation of the difficulties inherent to a girl’s maturation into womanhood are mediated through the cushioning presence of yards of calico, wool and muslin. As a 10-year-old, excited but terrified at the prospect of my own encroaching puberty, reading the passages in “Little Town on the Prairie” (1941) detailing, say, Mary Ingalls’s going-away-to-college outfit, with its “gored skirt of brown cashmere,” and “overskirt ... of brown-and-blue plaid” not to mention its confusingly named “flounced train” and “pleated flounce” (were those one and the same?) acted as a balm, a calming litany; covered-up fashion, it seemed, could protect you from the grenade that your body was slowly but surely becoming.

Keeping this potential explosiveness to oneself, however, could also be understood as a sign of strength. As 32-year-old Aminatou Sow, a digital strategist and the co-host of the popular podcast “Call Your Girlfriend,” told me, “if you let women dress for themselves, we’d all be wearing muumuus and caftans.” Sow, who grew up Muslim in Guinea and Nigeria before moving to Europe and then the States, cited the comfort factor of these silhouettes (“anything that looks like a sack is my jam”), but also the sense of inner confidence that they foster, one that she first recognized in the women she grew up among in West Africa. “It’s part of my cultural heritage. ... I don’t need to show my shoulders, I don’t need to show my back. I know what I’m carrying underneath this thing,” she said. “I really disagree with women who think walking around naked is liberation. I’m like, ‘I’m sorry, too may people get to enjoy this for it to be liberation,’ ” she added, only half in jest. Instead, she cites figures like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who, first as actresses and street-style sensations and later as designers of the Row, made dressing in long, hobo-ish layers chic. “It was really jarring, and men didn’t like it,” Sow recalled to me. “But there was something disgusting and liberating about it. These were girls who didn’t care how anyone else was supposed to be dressing. It was the rejection of body politics.”

Navigating the world in a woman’s body remains a fraught proposition in the most quotidian and granular of ways. And a woman with her body de-emphasized, with her conventional calling card scrapped — what a puzzle she is! I recall a couple of years ago walking in downtown Manhattan and spotting the writer Sheila Heti across the street. It was late fall, and as far as I can recall, Heti, whom I’ve never met, was wearing a knee-length nubby coat over a long skirt and some practical lace-up shoes, all in varying shades of gray and brown. In all the more typical ways, she was looking maybe a little drab, maybe a little dowdy. And yet, there was something about her air that was enviable. There she was, walking along, her hair in a ponytail, carrying a book and swinging it at her side, as if without a care in the world. She seemed completely at home — and completely herself — in her essentially concealed body.","Modest Dressing, as a Virtue",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/t-magazine/modest-fashion-clothes.html

In that way, it would be the sort of proof that the crown prince has the power to get his agenda done.
“This is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,” said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.","The arrests came at an awkward time for the kingdom.

Prince Mohammed recently invited more than 3,500 investors, corporate chief executives, and leaders of nongovernmental organizations to Riyadh for a three-day conference intended to promote future business opportunities. Officials promised that the public offering of the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, would go forward and that the sovereign wealth fund would soon rank among the richest in the world with more than $400 billion in assets by 2020. They pledged to build a utopian megacity on a stretch of deserted land that would attract capital and talent from all over the world.

The conference attracted a slew of senior executives and officials, including Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain; Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of the Japanese technology company SoftBank; and Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman. Some of the attendees spoke highly of Crown Prince Mohammed’s economic ambitions. The planned initial public offering of Aramco, they noted, could free government capital to spend on urban investment and job development. Cultural changes like granting women the right to drive could encourage Western companies to invest in or start operations in Saudi Arabia.

Despite the goodwill, few had backed the effort with time and money. And the weekend’s arrests could add to that reluctance. But they could also change some perceptions, if the crown prince can eventually show a broader commitment to shaking up an entrenched royal bureaucracy.

“I think this is going to slow things down, but if the gambit is successful it will help,” said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas company now attempting to make energy deals with Saudi Arabia. Speaking of Crown Crown Prince Mohammed, he said, “Once he has consolidated power, he will do what he wants to do, which is to modernize the country and modernize Islam, which are all good things. But it might be very dangerous and it might not work.”

Even before the arrests, investors didn’t quite know what to make of the kingdom.

Saudi Arabia has unveiled a sweeping economic reconstruction called Vision 2030, intended to diversify the country’s employment beyond oil. The cornerstone of the economic effort is the proposed initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, which exchanges around the world have been vying to secure. In a tweet just hours before the arrests, President Trump said he would appreciate it if the Saudi Aramco public offering took place on the New York Stock Exchange.

The crown prince and his father, King Salman, have also won praise from local and international business leaders for their promises to return the kingdom to the kind of religious moderation that was more prevalent before a period of religious and sectarian unrest in 1979, when the royal family began to rely on conservative Islamic clerics to guarantee stability. They have had the temerity to take on the religious police and begin rolling back some social policies.

But Saudi Arabia has also faced unusual turbulence, complete with the sacking of two crown princes, a costly war in Yemen and a confrontation with Qatar. The weak price of oil has amplified the financial stress in the kingdom. The government has been forced to cut benefits for highly paid civil servants.

There remains a great deal of skepticism that the economic re-engineering can be pulled off, in part because much of the royal family and old guard have been made rich from payments by Saudi Aramco, whose books are essentially closed to the public. That is one reason there is growing talk that the Saudis will eventually turn to China, rather than the London or New York stock exchanges, to get around Western regulators and raise capital for Saudi Aramco.

“I don’t see them get investor interest unless they can produce a set of financial books that have been audited to Western accounting standards,” said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments, a firm based in New York that specializes in energy. “If this is a step to getting to that, then this is a good thing. But I don’t know that because I can’t read the palace intrigue.”

The arrests just make it harder to sort through the business climate.

Some interpreted the arrests as being disturbingly arbitrary. One of the officials arrested was the former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco board member. Another was Adel Fakieh, an early drafter of the crown prince’s reforms, who was ousted from his post of economy minister earlier Saturday.

“I don’t think it sends a particularly good signal to investors,” said Rachel Ziemba, managing director for emerging markets at Roubini Global Economics, a research firm in New York.

There is another school of thought among business leaders and analysts that the arrests were part of an effort to make the Saudi Aramco offering and other reforms unstoppable. In that way, it would be the sort of proof that the crown prince has the power to get his agenda done.

“This is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,” said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.

Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. “Does this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?” she asked. “It’s a high-stakes game.”",Investors Worldwide Size Up Palace Intrigue in Oil-Rich Kingdom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/business/saudi-arabia-arrests-investors.html

I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even.

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

About 70 years ago, Beulah Wilson and her husband, Jonah, set out to find a new place to call home outside San Antonio. They searched for seven years, looking for a safe area with good schools and friendly neighbors, before they found the perfect community: Sutherland Springs.

When they arrived, the area’s most promising days in south-central Texas had come and gone. The Great Depression had ended the wintertime flow of wealthy northern tourists who came to bathe in the sulfur springs on the Cibolo Creek. A 52-room luxury hotel had been deserted.

But Ms. Wilson saw something special in Sutherland Springs.

“Everybody knew everybody,” Ms. Wilson, 88, said on Sunday evening. “You didn’t keep your doors locked or your cars locked, unless you lived on the main street. We had no crime here.”

But everything in Sutherland Springs changed around 11:20 a.m. on Sunday, when a 26-year-old man wearing all black and a ballistic vest opened fire with a military-style rifle at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. The gunman, identified by law enforcement officials as Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 people and injured about 20 more.

In studies, mice that had a microbiota preconditioned by the typical American diet did not respond as healthfully to a plant-based diet.
Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome.","Depending on the body site, anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent of the organisms that make up the microbiota cannot be cultured and identified with the older, traditional techniques used by microbiologists.

If the institutes’ five-year project succeeds in defining changes in the microbiome that are associated with disease, it has the potential to transform medicine, assuming ways can be found to correct microbial distortions in the affected tissues.

Here are some of the demonstration projects already underway:

Skin: Dr. Martin J. Blaser, microbiologist and director of the human microbiome program at New York University School of Medicine, is directing examination of the organisms on the skin of 75 people with and without psoriasis, checking whether agents used to treat the condition adversely alter the microbiome.

Vagina: Jacques Ravel at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and Larry J. Forney at the University of Idaho are studying 200 women to determine the microbial changes that may result in a common and difficult-to-control infection called bacterial vaginosis, which afflicts more than 20 million American women of childbearing age.

Blood: At Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Gregory A. Storch, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease, and colleagues are examining the role of viruses and the immune system in the blood and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of children who develop serious fevers that result in some 20 million visits a year to hospital emergency rooms.

Gastrointestinal tract: Claire M. Fraser-Liggett, a microbiologist, and Dr. Alan R. Shuldiner, a geneticist, both at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, are exploring how the microbiome affects the body’s use of energy and the development of obesity.

Previous studies have already found differences in the gut microbiota of lean and obese adults. There is also evidence that the typical high-calorie American diet rich in sugar, meats and processed foods may adversely affect the balance of microbes in the gut and foster the extraction and absorption of excess calories from food.

Compared to lean mice, obese mice have a 50 percent reduction in organisms called Bacteroidetes and a proportional increase in Firmicutes, and lean mice get fat when given fecal transplants from obese mice. A similar shift has been observed in people, and the distorted ratio of organisms was shown to reverse in people who lose weight following bariatric surgery.

There is also evidence that microbes residing in the gut can affect distant sites through their influence on a person’s immune responses. This indirect action has been suggested as a possible mechanism behind rheumatoid arthritis. In mice, certain bacteria in the gut have been shown to foster production of antibodies that attack the joints, resulting in the joint destruction typical of rheumatoid arthritis.

Similarly, studies have suggested a role of the gut microbiota in the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and even chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers have suggested that in genetically susceptible people, altered microbes in the gut may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to the production of antibodies that adversely affect normal brain development.

Among the challenges in elucidating the microbiome’s role in health and disease is determining whether changes found in the microorganisms inhabiting various organs are a cause or an effect. Most of what is already known about the microbiota in people with various health problems is based on observation, making it difficult to say which came first: the disease or the disrupted microbiota.

Animal studies like those mentioned above are a clue but not proof of a similar effect in people. Until therapeutic studies now underway are completed, people with conditions thought to be influenced by the microbiome have no choice currently but to rely on possible treatments suggested by animal research and some preliminary human studies.

For example, people with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic disorders and infections with drug-resistant organisms may benefit from taking probiotics, though some probiotics sold in health food and drugstores may be ineffective. It may be necessary to tailor-make the remedy for each condition or even each patient.

Meanwhile, people interested in fostering a health-promoting array of gut microorganisms should consider shifting from a diet heavily based on meats, carbohydrates and processed foods to one that emphasizes plants. As Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, a genomics specialist at Washington University School of Medicine, told The Times last year, “The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food.”",Unlocking the Secrets of the Microbiome,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/well/live/unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-microbiome.html

If an amalgam of McCarthyism and the notorious Willie Horton ad suits your taste, then you want to get hold of a mailer sent to Long Island voters on behalf of the Republican candidate for Nassau County executive. As odious campaign material goes, this one is hard to beat. Yet the candidate, Jack Martins, says he firmly stands by it.

The mailer shows three shirtless Latino men, covered in tattoos and representing MS-13, the vicious gang begun by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles that now menaces Long Island. “Meet Your New Neighbors!” a headline above them says, adding this about Mr. Martins’s Democratic opponent: “Laura Curran will roll out the welcome mat for violent gangs like MS-13!” Ms. Curran, the text says, is “MS-13’s choice for county executive.”

That was the Willie Horton part of the message — a blatant race-based appeal to fear. You may recall the Horton commercial, which the elder George Bush ran in his 1988 presidential campaign. It showed a black man who had raped a white woman and assaulted her husband while free on a Massachusetts prison-furlough program that was supported by Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate. As a vote magnet, it worked for Mr. Bush. Mr. Martins, a former state senator, clearly hopes it does the same for him in Tuesday’s election.

Now for the McCarthyism: “Laura Curran’s campaign is supported and funded by New York City special interest groups.” This is an attempted smear reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy’s heyday, with its suggestion that Ms. Curran shares the views of unnamed groups that “want to make Nassau County a sanctuary county for illegal immigrants.” It’s the old guilt by association.

In fact, Ms. Curran, a county legislator, supports neither sanctuary counties nor sanctuary cities, terms typically applied to localities whose police forces are ordered not to ask about the immigration status of people taken into custody. “It makes MS-13 look like a PAC that’s supporting me,” she said, understandably offended.","Willie Horton, Updated for the Trump Era",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/opinion/jack-martins-long-island-ad.html

It was not that Mr. Urie, 37, hasn’t played larger-than-life roles over the course of his career, from Marc St. James on the ABC comedy “Ugly Betty,” to Barbra Streisand’s assistant in the one-man play, “Buyer and Cellar,” to the frenetic lead in Gogol’s “The Government Inspector” recently. And after “Torch Song,” which runs through Dec. 9, he will play Hamlet at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington.

But there was something about this part that Mr. Urie said he found daunting. “In the first scene, the character is in drag,” he said. “And I thought, ‘I could never do that. I could never be that guy. I’m never going to be that free, that brave.’ It was way too scary.”

Mr. Fierstein said one reason he had held off bringing the show back to New York for 30 years was to make sure that he had the right Arnold. And while he knew Mr. Urie’s work, mostly from “Ugly Betty,” and said that he was a “wonderful actor,” it wasn’t until a 2016 reading that he realized he had found his leading man.

“It was just there,” Mr. Fierstein said. “There was that thing you hope for, a magical connection between actor and role.”

The reading was equally revelatory for Mr. Urie: “At the end, I thought, ‘Maybe I am Arnold!”

“Michael understood the character at that first reading,” Mr. Kaufman said. And, he added, laughing, “Actors aren’t always the best judges of what parts they should play.”

Noticed, but Not Typecast

On a recent Saturday afternoon, in the three-hour break between the matinee and evening performances of “Torch Song,” Mr. Urie threaded his way through the crowds of Times Square to an early dinner at the Lambs Club, fashionably dressed in a dark green quilted jacket, a pair of skinny black jeans and black ankle high boots that he said were almost an exact replica of a pair his “Ugly Betty” character had worn.

As he passed a cluster of middle-aged men standing on the sidewalk, one spotted Mr. Urie, did a double-take and then yelled out, “You were great last night.”

“That was a trick,” Mr. Urie said, not missing a beat. “I don’t remember his name.”

He was joking of course.

Mr. Urie lives with his boyfriend, Ryan Spahn, also an actor, in an apartment on the northern fringe of Hell’s Kitchen decorated with items taken from the sets of previous jobs. (Their dining room table is Vanessa Williams’s desk from “Ugly Betty” and a bedroom lamp was lifted from the set of “Partners,” Mr. Urie’s short-lived CBS sitcom.) The two recently celebrated their nine-year anniversary by going to a disaster movie, the critically savaged “Geostorm.” (“It was wonderfully terrible,” he said, giggling.)

At the restaurant, he glanced at the menu, announced that he tried to avoid both red meat and alcohol when doing a play, because they make him sleepy, and ordered the halibut, a side of roasted carrots and a Diet Coke.

As the waiter walked away, Mr. Urie said he had only broken that dietary rule once, when he was in Washington doing “Buyer and Cellar,” and was up for a part in the Broadway revival of an award-winning play he declined to name: the role of the gay best friend to the female lead.

The audition had gone well, and he and the director seemed to be on the same wavelength, he said. But that day, in between his matinee and evening performances, he got a call. “You were great,” Mr. Urie said the director told him. “But there is one small, but probably insurmountable, obstacle: The estate that controls the rights is insisting that the role not be played by an openly gay character.”

The part went to someone else.

Mr. Urie said he was so angry, “I went out and had a beer and a huge hamburger. And then I went home to take a nap.”

That was perhaps the only time in his career, he said, when his sexuality might have lost him a role. (He said the producers were convinced that if audiences knew the actor was gay it would take the ambiguity out of the opening scene in the play.) In fact, he said, his openness about his sexuality had mostly been a boon to his career: “If I had never done these gay characters, you would have no idea of who I was,” he said. “You would never have heard of me.”

His Own Way In

Getting the role in “Torch Song” was one thing. But Mr. Urie said he struggled early on with how to make it his own.

Should he get to know Mr. Fierstein, who based the character on his early career experiences as a drag performer? Spend more time with him? “But I gradually realized he didn’t want me to ‘do’ him, or else he wouldn’t have hired me,” he concluded. “He would have hired someone who was just like him.”

Mr. Fierstein was, however, a frequent and unpredictable presence at rehearsals.

“What was so funny is that he would always walk in the room when I would be questioning something about the role,” Mr. Urie explained. “I would read a line and then ask, ‘Why do I even say this?’ And then I would hear from the back of the room, this voice yelling out” — he imitates Mr. Fierstein’s raspy growl — “‘Who wrote this?’’’

“I finally asked him, ‘Do you wait out there in the hallway for 20 minutes, and then pick the perfect moment to come in the room?’”

At another point, Mr. Urie asked Mr. Fierstein for guidance about his character’s relationship with Ed, his bisexual, on-and-off lover. “Why do I keep going back to him? Why do I love this guy? And Harvey said to me, ‘Because he lets you.’ Which is such a great answer, because when you think of the gay community — especially then — we can be so withholding with love.”

There are reports, for now unconfirmed, that this critically acclaimed “Torch Song” will move to Broadway in the fall. No one involved will discuss that possibility. But Mr. Urie is convinced that this production has firmly reestablished the play’s theatrical importance and the power of its message.

“I run into people all the time who tell me that they saw this play in its original run and it changed their lives,” Mr. Urie said. “In fact, I got a letter the other day from someone who wrote, “I’ve been in love with Arnold for 35 years.’”",‘Maybe I Am Arnold!’ How Michael Urie Agreed to Fill Harvey Fierstein’s Shoes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/theater/michael-urie-harvey-fierstein-play-torch-song.html

We have seen this movie before. Sexual harassment complaints to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission increased 73 percent in the year after Anita Hill’s televised testimony about Clarence Thomas’s behavior in 1991. Still, Mr. Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court, while Ms. Hill went quietly back to being a law professor in Oklahoma. In the ensuing years, the issue cycled between headlines and whispers in a seemingly endless loop.

But this sequel seems to have a surprise ending, or at least a plot twist: The public outrage is deeper and more sustained, and the dominoes continue to fall.

Meet Our New Gender Editor .

Maybe it’s that the accusers this time were famous, media-savvy and mostly white actors with more star power than the accused (unlike, say, Paula Jones vs. Bill Clinton). Maybe it’s reflective of a specific period in American history, in which working women of a new generation — those who had grown up with working mothers — decided that enough was enough.

Certainly the endlessly expanding power of social media plays a role: The #metoo hashtag has been used in millions of posts over the past few weeks; been translated into Italian (#QuellaVoltaChe, or “that time when”) and French (#BalanceTonPorc, or “out your pig”); and inspired a congressional spinoff.

Several experts likened it to a dam breaking, the cumulative effect of harassment claims over decades and especially the last few years. Some see it as the other shoe dropping after Donald J. Trump’s taped boasting about offensive behavior did not block his path to the presidency: He may have gotten away with it, but women were no longer going to let that boss, that mentor, that colleague get away with it, too.

“There is no doubt that having an accused sexual predator in the White House is hanging over this,” said Jaclyn Friedman, the author of “Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power, and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All,” scheduled for publication this month. “People feel like they can’t do anything about that right now, but at least they can do something about this.”

An Army of Voices

If you are a woman, or know somebody who is, it’s safe to assume you have talked about Mr. Weinstein at the dinner table, on the subway, in bed, at work, and any other place where people gather. Perhaps you’ve asked your partner, your mother, your boss or your friend for the first time, as I have, if she, too, is among this strange new tribe. (“Who was your Weinstein?” we all suddenly want to know.)

I’ve heard from women who said they’ve retroactively confronted their harassers and those who enabled them, and from men who are re-examining, perhaps somewhat nervously, their own behavior. The new conversation goes way beyond the workplace to sweep in street harassment, rape culture and “toxic masculinity” — terminology that would have been confined to gender studies classes, not found in mainstream newspapers, not so long ago.

“In the women’s movement of the 1970s we had this phrase ‘the click moment,’” Barbara Berg, a historian and the author of the 2009 book “Sexism in America: Alive, Well and Ruining Our Future,” said. “This is the click moment. It’s like, ‘Enough.’ And then there’s a snowball effect: Once you see women speaking truth to power and not being told, ‘This is just what you have to put up with,’ then it encourages other women to stand up.”

With Mr. Weinstein, the accusers were on the record, poised, and more of them seem to emerge each day, so no individual had to bear the burden alone, as Professor Hill had. “When you have Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow in the same sentence, well, people take note,” the sociologist Michael Kimmel said.

But behind these famous faces was an army of ordinary voices, too, using social media to collectively tell their stories — but also for action. In the case of Bill O’Reilly, remember, it was a coordinated effort, by groups that included the organizers of the Women’s March, that urged advertisers to #DropOReilly. They, and Fox News, ultimately did.

Another significant new element is the presence of what many have called silent co-conspirators: dozens of people, over dozens of years, who knew what was going on but did nothing.

“There is this web of enablers,” Professor Kimmel, who runs the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University, said. “Bob Weinstein doesn’t say to Harvey, ‘You better stop or I’ll kick you out of the company.’ Billy Bush does not say to Donald Trump, ‘That’s disgusting, not to mention illegal.’ In the sexual assault world we often talk about how we incorrectly interpret women’s silence as consent. Well, we also mistake men’s silence for assent.”

A Look Back

If this is a moment of historical social change, it is worth looking at what led us here.

It was two years after that Ms. magazine cover, in 1979, that Catharine A. MacKinnon published a groundbreaking legal argument: that sexual harassment was a form of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was based on a legal theory she had developed while in law school.

Photo

That legal argument was tested with Mechelle Vinson, one of a number of African-American women who were involved in early sexual harassment lawsuits — this one a bank teller who said she was repeatedly raped by her married boss. In 1986, her case, with Professor MacKinnon’s help, was part of a Supreme Court ruling that enshrined the harassment-as-discrimination theory into law.

Then came Professor Hill, whose televised testimony about Mr. Thomas, her former boss — at the E.E.O.C., of all places — was, Ms. Berg said, in effect “home-schooling a generation of Americans in what sexual harassment was.” Almost immediately, the phone hotline for 9to5, a support group for working women, began ringing off the hook.

“People were almost bewildered,” the group’s director told The New York Times in 1992. “You mean this is sexual harassment? You mean I could do something about this?”

Ms. Berg said she remembers a former colleague calling to ask, of their former boss, “Did he proposition you, too?” (He had.) Professor Kimmel said his mother told him over dinner that she was harassed in graduate school.

“It was literally water-cooler conversation everywhere,” said Freada Kapor Klein, who conducted one of the first surveys on sexual harassment in the 1970s.

But most of those stories were shared in private — in part because of what the world watched Professor Hill endure. Before an all-male Senate judiciary panel, she was accused of bringing “sleaze” into the nomination process, portrayed as suffering from delusional fantasies, and famously called, by the pundit David Brock, “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.”

“I remember the anger of that moment,” Teresa Younger, then a 22-year-old nanny and now president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, said. “Anita Hill was the example of a strong, accomplished black woman, and if she of all people could be discredited then it seemed women, particularly women of color, had no voice when it came to sexual harassment.”

From ‘I Believe’ to #metoo

It’s worth noting that the campaign slogan back then, on buttons and bumper stickers rather than Facebook and Twitter, was not “Me Too” but “I Believe Anita” — a message of solidarity, not self-exposure.

After Professor Hill came Ms. Jones, whose lawsuit against Mr. Clinton was dismissed. Others won in court but struggled in the aftermath: Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was sexually assaulted by drunken officers, was sidelined and ultimately quit her job. Rena Weeks, a law secretary who was harassed by a partner, never worked again.

“I think for a long time it shut women up, at least publicly,” Professor Kimmel said.

In her 2017 book, “Butterfly Politics,” Professor MacKinnon adapts a concept from chaos theory in which the tiny motion of a butterfly’s wings can trigger a tornado half a world away. Under the right conditions, she posits, small actions can produce major social transformations.

“Ashley Judd is the butterfly of this moment,” Professor MacKinnon said of the actor who began the recent groundswell of accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “She is the one who broke it open, who has made this possible for so many other women. And so you have an explosion of it because it’s for so long been suppressed.”

Professor Kimmel, the sociologist, said, “There comes a tipping point when the ‘frame’ changes.”

”One day, segregated water fountains seemed ‘normal’ if you were a white Southerner,” he noted. “It’s just how things were. Then they’re illegal, and a few years later you say, ‘Wow, how did we ever see that as O.K.?’”

Ms. Friedman, though, said she is waiting for an important moment: “When are we going to start believing people the first time?”

“When is it going to be that one instance is enough, and that you don’t have to find out 30 years later?” she asked. “I also worry that there is the possibility for this to be treated like a cancer, and now Harvey is gone so the cancer is excised. But Harvey is not the only cancer.”",The ‘Click’ Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/sexual-harrasment-weinstein-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

The word “Trump” is not mentioned in the two-minute ad. Nor is the word “Democrat.”",A Post-Obama Democratic Party in Search of Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/magazine/a-post-obama-democratic-party-in-search-of-itself.html

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

During a recent interview, Ms. Gatewood walked the green-and-white halls of the building in the financial district, her head held high, her pace brisk.","But when the luxury hotel closed its doors on March 1 for years of renovations, Ms. Gatewood found herself without a job, along with more than 1,200 unionized hotel employees. Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

On the afternoon that the Waldorf closed, Hilton Worldwide, which manages the hotel, treated employees to a party in the Grand Ballroom, complete with champagne.

“But champagne is for celebrations,” Ms. Gatewood said. “And what were we celebrating? We were losing our jobs. We needed a good strong vodka, or maybe a Scotch.”

At the end of the party, the employees turned toward the stage, where a large mock light switch was flipped and the lights went out.

Seeking a fit for her specialized skills was not Ms. Gatewood’s only concern: She feared the challenge of finding work in her 60s. She joined the 91,000 New York State residents who are 55 or older and looking for work. About a third of people in that demographic face long-term unemployment, or at least 27 weeks without work, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.

At the party, Ms. Gatewood said, many colleagues whispered hopes of returning when the hotel reopens. She hoped her $10,000 post-tax severance package would help carry her through, along with her savings of $50,000, roughly her annual salary. Ms. Gatewood provides for her two adult sons and her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. They live together in a home she rents for $1,000 a month.

Her younger son, Isaiah Page, 27, got a minimum-wage job about a year ago stocking shelves at a supermarket, but he is not yet able to contribute to the family’s expenses. His brother, William Page, 33, has been out of work for many years.

With her savings in jeopardy, Ms. Gatewood decided she needed to develop skills for a different career. In March, she enrolled at Grace Institute, a job-training program serving low-income women in New York City. During a recent interview, Ms. Gatewood walked the green-and-white halls of the building in the financial district, her head held high, her pace brisk.

“This is my home away from home,” she said with a smile.

She commuted an hour and a half from Staten Island to Lower Manhattan by train, ferry and CitiBike to attend classes five days a week in professional development and typing. In August, she graduated from the institute, which is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. That month, Catholic Charities provided her with $279 from the fund for a suit, shirt, shoes and coat for job interviews.

Last week, Ms. Gatewood started a temporary full-time job at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where she works as a room service attendant, filling in for a staff member on leave.

Hilton, when contacted this week for this article, offered to help Ms. Gatewood find a permanent job at one of its other locations in New York City.

Before securing temporary employment, Ms. Gatewood received $425 a week in unemployment benefits. She has many years of hospitality experience, but said she would like to one day work in real estate.

Ms. Gatewood said she wished that she could have spent more time with her sons when they were younger. After her partner left she began waitressing, and the flexible hours allowed her to see her sons off to school and day care. But long shifts kept her out sometimes until 5 a.m., leaving her older son to look after his brother. In 1998, they settled in the Staten Island neighborhood of Park Hill, where they still live today. Ms. Gatewood would occasionally work seven days a week and was not home enough, she said.

She wants her sons to find jobs they are passionate about and make lives for themselves.

“My job as a mother isn’t done,” she said. “I still have to continue to keep them, to assist them, to guide them. I have to fulfill my responsibility to them. If there’s parenting left to be done, you keep doing it.

Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries.

With Iran, which is largely Shiite, and Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, each trying to assert dominance over the Middle East, Yemen has emerged as a battleground.

With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since. The fighting has led to an immense humanitarian crisis — the United Nations has described it as the world’s worst — in which 10,000 people have died and at least three million have been displaced.

The latest step in the conflict came on Saturday, when a ballistic missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being intercepted by the Saudi military. Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile.

Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit the Yemeni capital, Sana, with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.

While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the “direct command” of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say.

It is unclear whether Tehran has sent, or even could send, missiles to Yemen, which is under a tightly controlled air and sea blockade. In recent years, ships believed to be from Iran have been intercepted transporting small weapons, but there have been no reports involving missiles or missile parts.

The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran denied that his country had provided the rebels in Yemen with missiles, describing the accusation as “baseless.”

“It is not possible for the Islamic Republic to transfer missiles to Yemen,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim. “These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry.”

The Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles nevertheless suggests there is some merit to allegations from Saudi Arabia, the United States and Israel that Iran is providing parts or technology. Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.

Saudi Arabia has set up a sea blockade around Yemen, assisted by others, including the United States Navy. The kingdom has also bought hundreds of billions of dollars of advanced weapons and bombs from the United States and Britain.

Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the notion that his country was involved in the attack on Riyadh. “The people of Yemen are defending themselves,” he said.

He also pointed to Saudi Arabia’s deals with Washington and London for arms being used in Yemen. “Today, we should ask Saudi Arabia under what pretext it has been attacking Yemen with all its equipment from air, land and sea,” he said.

On Sunday, in addition to shutting down Yemen’s points of entry, the Saudi-led coalition announced bounties for 40 members of the Houthi leadership, ranging from $20 million to $40 million each, describing the targets as “terrorists.” Most of the people on the list were members of the government that had been formed with the party of the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.

Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.

Separately, state television in Iran reported that Tehran and Riyadh had been unable to work out an arrangement that would allow Iranians to travel to Saudi Arabia for umrah, a minor pilgrimage that can be made at any time of the year. The major hajj pilgrimage, in contrast, is defined by specific dates on the Islamic lunar calendar.

There was no indication that the failure to reach an accord was linked to the developments in Lebanon and Yemen.

The Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Hamid Mohammadi, who leads the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization in Tehran, as saying that Iran and Saudi Arabia would hold talks in December for hajj travel next year.

No Iranians are thought to have traveled to the holy Saudi city of Mecca for the hajj in 2016 because of tensions between the two countries. A year earlier, thousands of pilgrims, including 464 Iranians, died in a stampede there, prompting Iranian leaders to accuse the Saudis of mismanaging the holy sites.

WASHINGTON — Senator Rand Paul suffered five broken ribs and bruises to his lungs in an altercation with a neighbor on Friday at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., one of the senator’s advisers said on Sunday. The injuries, which the adviser said left Mr. Paul in considerable pain, appear to be much worse than the “minor” injuries that the police had reported on Saturday.

Doug Stafford, a senior strategist to Mr. Paul, said in a statement that it was unclear when the senator would be able to return to work.

According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Paul told the police that he was tackled from behind after the neighbor entered his property, NBC News has reported. The senator also had cuts to his nose and mouth and had trouble breathing because of the rib injuries, the complaint said. Mr. Stafford attributed the injuries to “high-velocity severe force.”

The Kentucky State Police arrested the neighbor, Rene Boucher, 59, and took him to the Warren County Regional Jail, where he was released on $7,500 bond. Mr. Boucher, an anesthesiologist who invented a rice-filled vest used for back pain, has a court date set for Thursday. It is unclear what set off the altercation.

In a tweet on Sunday, Mr. Paul referred to the episode as an “unfortunate event” and thanked his well-wishers for their support.

On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paul said the senator had been “blindsided” but was “fine.” Mr. Stafford’s statement alluded to a more severe kind of attack: “Displaced rib fractures can lead to life-threatening injuries,” he said. “This type of injury is also accompanied by severe pain that can last weeks to months.” Three of Mr. Paul’s broken ribs were displaced, Mr. Stafford said.","Rand Paul Had 5 Ribs Broken in Attack, Contrary to Initial Reports",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/rand-paul-attack-neighbor.html

It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens.

The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.

The New York Times is part of the group of more than 380 journalists from over 90 media organizations in 67 countries that have spent months examining the latest set of documents.

As with the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers leak came through a duo of reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and was then shared with I.C.I.J., a Washington-based group that won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the millions of records of a Panamanian law firm. The release of that trove of documents led to the resignation of one prime minister last year and to the unmasking of the wealth of people close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Since the dawn of the industrial age, humans have been pumping increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil and gas. Researchers at the Mauna Loa Observatory, perched on the side of a volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, have measured atmospheric levels of this greenhouse gas since 1958. That first year, carbon dioxide averaged 316 parts per million. In May, it reached 410 p.p.m. — an amount never before experienced in the history of our species. This atmospheric carbon dioxide — as well as other heat-trapping gases and other air pollutants emitted by humans — is affecting our planet profoundly.

This comprehensive report — the most up-to-date climate science report in the world — is an outstanding example of federal science in action, and is especially noteworthy given the current political climate.

The majority of the report’s 51 authors were drawn from federal agencies, like NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy. Much of the foundational data and modeling that underpin the report rely on government investments in observational data and high-performance computing. The report was strengthened by an extensive review process involving the public, the National Academy of Sciences, and all relevant federal agencies, spanning two administrations.

The report concludes that “global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of the natural variations in climate that have occurred throughout Earth’s history.” It finds that “human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” The bottom line is that this report confirms and strengthens what the vast majority of climate scientists have known for decades: that climate is changing and humans are primarily responsible.

Recent observations and investment in modeling and research have only strengthened the quality and amount of evidence collected. As the report documents, each of the last three years has successively been the warmest on record based on observational data going back to the late 19th century, and 16 of the last 17 years have been among the 17 warmest years on record globally. Global sea level has risen by about 7 to 8 inches since 1900, with nearly half this rise occurring since 1993. A substantial component of this rise, which is accelerating the increased frequency of disruptive “nuisance” flooding in dozens of coastal American cities, is because of human activity. At the same time, the area of ocean covered by Arctic sea ice in September (the typical annual minimum) has decreased by about 50 percent, while its volume has decreased even more dramatically as the remaining ice thins.

The report also highlights growing reasons for concern. For example, ocean acidification, which occurs when atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by seawater, is taking place at what is thought to be the fastest rate in at least 66 million years. Coupled with reductions in oxygen content in near-coastal American waters, this poses a significant threat to coastal fisheries and ecosystems. Much of the western United States is facing a growing threat of more severe drought and larger wildfires as higher temperatures, reduced snow pack and earlier spring snow melt reduce water availability during the warm season.",The Climate Risks We Face,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/climate-report-global-warming.html

BRUSSELS — The former president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, and four former members of his regional government turned themselves in to the Belgian police on Sunday morning, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor’s office said.

The spokesman, Gilles Dejemeppe, said that they would be questioned over the next 24 hours by an investigative judge. They were released late Sunday evening, European news services reported, but were prohibited from leaving Belgium without the investigative judge’s permission.

A Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant on Friday for Mr. Puigdemont and the four former members of his cabinet, who left Catalonia for Brussels. The warrant was sent to the Belgian federal prosecutor.

Mr. Puigdemont told RTBF, a Belgian television broadcaster, on Friday that he was “completely available to cooperate” with the Belgian court system, which he called “the real justice.”

“At this point there are no guarantees of getting a just and independent trial which could escape the enormous pressure and influence of politics on the judicial powers in Spain,” Mr. Puigdemont said.

Administrators whose most solemn responsibility was protecting children instead chose to look the other way and protect child abusers. The music teacher, a cultish figure named Johannes Somary, was the worst abuser during my time. One of his victims later committed suicide.

The current torrent of harassment revelations — following Jodi Kantor’s and Megan Twohey’s Times exposé of Harvey Weinstein — has caused me to think back on high school again, because every big case has had something in common with Horace Mann.

People knew.

Even if they didn’t know the details — I didn’t know what Somary was actually doing — they knew that something was wrong. At Fox News, many knew that Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly mistreated women. At ABC, The New Republic and NPR, respectively, people talked about the harassment by Mark Halperin, Leon Wieseltier and Michael Oreskes. In Hollywood, people talked about Weinstein and Kevin Spacey — not to mention Donald Trump, who nonetheless became a heavily promoted reality star.

As the screenwriter Scott Rosenberg has written about Weinstein, “Everybody knew.” (The full quotation includes a colloquial adverb of emphasis between “everybody” and “knew.”)

“Maybe we didn’t know the degree. The magnitude of the awfulness,” Rosenberg continued. “But we knew something.”

And yet no one did anything about it. People were afraid to, or didn’t know how. So they — we — became part of an unwitting conspiracy of inaction.

This conspiracy has spanned the relatively powerless, like interns, secretaries and teenagers, to the wealthy and famous, as well as every level of power in between. Jill Abramson, my old boss, is one of the toughest journalists I know. Still, as a midlevel manager two decades ago, she didn’t go over the head of her old boss — Oreskes — to report his behavior at The Times, as she regretfully said last week.

Post-Weinstein, the emphasis has been on holding other abusers accountable. So far, each seems to deserve his delayed consequences. (And, yes, the severity of the various abuses varies.) I hope the exposés continue.

But post facto truth and punishment are not enough. We also need to figure out how to prevent future abuse. We need to make inaction feel unacceptable.

Doing so will require changes from both organizations and individuals. Every workplace and school should be asking itself: Do people here know how to report a suspicion of abuse? Do they feel comfortable doing so even when, as is typical, they have only an incomplete sense of it?

At most places, the answers remain no and no.

Organizations need “multiple, accessible avenues of complaint,” as a federal task force concluded. These avenues should be blazingly obvious, not buried in a corporate policy that nobody reads. They should include anonymous reporting options. They should feed into a process that’s confidential and fair, including to the accused.

Every leader should also read case studies, to understand how frequently other leaders, at Horace Mann, NPR and elsewhere, have bungled these situations, usually through cowardice. Often, a victim or someone else did summon the courage to come forward, only to have the institution do little or nothing.

But the changes can’t be only about policies and organizations. They need to be personal, too. I’m guessing that you get angry when you think about the abuse committed by Weinstein, O’Reilly, Trump or Somary — about the long-lasting misery they have inflicted on other human beings. I certainly do.

The next time I see something that doesn’t seem quite right, I’m going to remember that anger.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

via Giphy

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

A scene from “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

• “What’s at the X?” Bob wondered as he looked at Will’s map. “Pirate treasure?” You may recall that as Mikey in “The Goonies,” one of the ur-texts of “Stranger Things,” Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willy’s loot. It was one of several fun meta moments this season. (See also: Max dismissing Lucas’s description of last season’s events as “a little derivative in parts.”)

• In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyce’s side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was. I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modine’s evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in “Aliens,” another of this series’ touchstones.

Having kids is one of life’s greatest experiences. It’s also expensive. Between school supplies and summer camps, sports and doctor’s visits, raising children increasingly takes more and more money. I should know — my wife, Jeanette, and I have four. We’ve been blessed in recent years, but I know what it’s like to start a family and struggle to make ends meet. My parents were immigrants who came to America with virtually nothing, and after I finished law school, I owed more than $100,000 in student loans.

There’s a reason many people feel it’s harder to afford children now than in previous generations. It’s true. According to federal data adjusted for inflation, from 1960 to 2015 the average annual cost of raising a child in a middle-income family rose by over $11,000. It’s now estimated that middle-class parents will spend more than $230,000 over the course of their son or daughter’s childhood — and that doesn’t even include college tuition.

Ask just about any couple and they’ll tell you this absolutely influences their decisions about when to have children and how many to have. As the economist Lyman Stone has shown, by 2012, the average number of children American women intended to have was 2.37, and the total fertility rate was 1.88 — a gap of about 0.5 children on average. Since the 1960s, there has been a consistent gap between intended and total fertility, even as the number of children American women desire to have and the total birthrate have declined over time.

There are many causes for this gap, but the increasing cost of childbearing clearly has played a role in its development. For example, think of families who delayed having children for a few years until they were more financially stable and may not have been able to have as many as they initially wanted. Or parents who wanted more children, but after their first or second realized they couldn’t afford the combined cost of taking care of the child and reducing their work hours. The German economist Anna Raute has isolated this “opportunity cost” of childbearing as a significant factor in fertility decisions.

Tax reform is a key part of reinvigorating the American dream so that couples have the flexibility to choose how to best start and raise a family. The status quo means the cost of having children makes those choices for them, resulting in smaller families, riskier pregnancies, longer commutes from more affordable exurbs and more missed recitals.

Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.

No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.

A Russian Billionaire Investor’s Stake in American Technology Companies The Kremlin controls Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank. Gazprom Investholding lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Kanton Services. Kanton Services owned DST USA II, which was used to invest in Facebook. VTB Bank gave $191 million to DST Investments 3 for its stake in Twitter. The venture capitalist Yuri Milner founded DST Global, which managed DST USA II and DST Investments 3.

Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America’s technology giants.

“Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind — not just commercial interests but state interests as well,” said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. “They go hand in hand.”

Mr. Carpenter added, “Oligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia’s crony capitalist system.”

There is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.

As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple — “nothing more than business,” he said, adding: “We are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it’s a commercial arrangement.”

(A statement from DST Global, Mr. Milner’s venture capital firm, appears here.)

The Path to Silicon Valley

Mr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.

He returned to Russia and in the late 1990s and worked as an executive at Bank Menatep, which was founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil tycoon who was stripped of his company, prosecuted and imprisoned after a televised confrontation with President Vladimir V. Putin.

Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov — an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev — and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.

Mr. Milner’s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia’s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.

In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner’s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner’s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.

“A number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said at the time.

The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection — through a succession of shell companies — to the Kremlin.

Ties to the Russian State

In those years, as part of its diplomatic “reset” with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia’s dependence on exporting oil and gas.

For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.

Gazprom Investholding is “used for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,” said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding’s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Over several years, Gazprom Investholding and a subsidiary made hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to a company called Kanton Services, according to records from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. Kanton, in turn, owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook. While it is unclear precisely when Kanton first received its stake in the DST entity, Kanton received $197 million of the Gazprom Investholding loans three months before Facebook announced its first deal with Mr. Milner, the records show.

Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner’s backer, Mr. Usmanov.

Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov’s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a “private investment company, (facebook and twitter).”

In the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors’ identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. “I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,” he said. What’s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.

To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like “Alleged Russian government funds,” “Mr. Usmanov” and “Facebook.” He pulled out a large bag of green M&M’s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M’s from one cup to another. “Money is fungible,” he explained, adding, “You can’t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.”

A spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, “did not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.”

Lucrative ‘Synergies’

The Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia’s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government’s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.

In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as “synergies.”

The Kroll report — a “reputation audit” — had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.

The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals — involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. “Usmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the ‘most improved’ oligarch over the past eight years,” one source told Kroll.

Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner’s Facebook investment.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a “passive investor” and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.

Gazprom Investholding called the loans “prudent,” saying they were “provided for general corporate purposes” at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he “operated in accordance” with the company’s charter.

To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.

After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.

In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company’s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.

At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. “I think it’s actually the opposite,” he replied. “I sometimes get informal advice from them.”

Obscure Financial Maneuvers

Mr. Milner’s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB.

Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB’s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank’s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.

VTB has operations across the world, including in the United States. In recent years, it has been involved in a number of politically sensitive deals, including a loan that financed the Russian government’s murky privatization of 19.5 percent of the oil giant Rosneft.

Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.

Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers “unsubstantiated.”

“VTB is really a slush fund for Putin,” said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is “the black cashier of the Putin crowd.”

Mr. Milner’s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB’s involvement.

In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global’s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.

The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.

On May 7, 2014 — six months after Twitter’s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares — VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.

DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.

In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was “solely a financial investment,” sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, “VTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.”

Twitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.

Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.

Beyond Social Media

Mr. Milner has also been active beyond Silicon Valley. He is a founder of the Breakthrough Prize, a series of lucrative scientific awards. And in July 2015, he was one of several high-profile investors in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother, Joshua. (Other investors and partners include Goldman Sachs, George Soros and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.)

Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global’s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.

Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.

In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.

Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, “if you’re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it’s easy to say, ‘Please don’t get involved in politics.’”

That “was my principle back then and still now,” he said, adding: “I prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy. And this is plenty for me.”",Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire’s Twitter and Facebook Investments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia.html

“I want to build a solid foundation to win championships,” he said at the time, “instead of just to win ball games.”

It looked like a possibility — for a little while. The Nets won 44 games in their first season under Mr. Brown. And they had nearly finished an even better second season when it was learned that Mr. Brown had applied to coach at the University of Kansas.

Angrily, Mr. Taub forced Mr. Brown’s resignation in April 1983, with just a few games left in the season.

“Whatever you want to call it, unethical or whatever, it didn’t do our organization any good,” Mr. Taub said afterward.

Two seasons later, frustrated by his experience with Mr. Brown and the injuries that had impeded the Nets’ progress, he announced that he had sold his stake to his partners. He conceded that running a sports team was not like running a business.

“In business, you can plan adjustments and make changes quickly,” he said after a tearful four-minute farewell speech at the team’s offices. But with a sports franchise, he said, “there’s injuries, personalities, and so many judgment calls made that can affect your success that it’s debilitating.”

Still, he repurchased a small stake in the team in 1991. That year, he overstepped his role’s boundaries, negotiating with Jim Valvano, the former North Carolina State coach, to replace Bill Fitch as the Nets’ coach. The team’s chief executive, Alan L. Aufzien, repudiated Mr. Taub publicly. “He doesn’t make offers,” Mr. Aufzien said of Mr. Taub. “He advises.”

In 1996, amid rumors that the Nets were going to be sold, the ownership restructured and placed Henry Taub in charge. But Joe remained a prominent voice among the team’s owners on the salary cap and other matters of basketball policy. He also took the lead in the unsuccessful pursuit of a friend, Rick Pitino, who was then the coach at the University of Kentucky, to take over as the Nets coach in 1996.

“More than the other owners, he was the heart and soul of the Nets,” Michael Rowe, a former president of the Nets, said in an interview. “He was relentless and impatient. He supported the staff, and he didn’t mind being the face of the franchise. He was flamboyant-looking, with his amazing white hair, and it’s no secret he didn’t mind being seen walking up to his seat, in the fifth row of the arena, a little late.”

The Nets were acquired by a consortium that included the philanthropist Raymond Chambers in 1998 and have been sold a few times since. But Mr. Taub retained a stake in the team for at least a decade longer.

Mr. Tesser, his son-in-law, said that Mr. Taub was bothered by the team’s relocation to Brooklyn in 2012 under its new owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov.

“He was devastated,” Mr. Tesser said. “He was out of the team by then, he had no control. He never enjoyed going to Brooklyn.”

Joseph Albert Taub was born in Paterson, N.J., on May 29, 1929. His father, Morris, was a junk dealer. His mother, the former Sylvia Sievitz, was a homemaker. Both were Polish immigrants.

Mr. Taub played forward on the basketball team at Eastside High School, in Paterson, and attended Rutgers University but did not graduate.

Henry Taub had already started Automatic Payrolls in 1949 to help businesses, among them dye houses in Paterson, prepare their payrolls. Joe soon joined his brother, followed by Mr. Lautenberg, who had been a salesman for Prudential Insurance. According to Mr. Tesser, Joe Taub oversaw the payrolls, Henry Taub was the strategist and Mr. Lautenberg oversaw sales.

The company, which eventually became known as Automatic Data Processing and later as ADP, went public in 1961. In its 2017 fiscal year, it had $12 billion in revenue.

Joe Taub retired in 1969 when he was 40 to devote himself to philanthropy, with a focus on causes in Paterson. He founded an after-school basketball league with his childhood neighbor, Larry Doby, the Hall of Fame baseball player who was the first African-American to play in the American League.

In addition to providing an outlet for youngsters to play sports, the league offers scholarships.

“I was born in Paterson, lived in Paterson, started my business in Paterson,” Mr. Taub told The New York Post in 2013. “Did it with tremendous problems like today. One-parent households, drugs, gangs. I wanted to come up with a program where we could combine academics with sports.”

He added, “When I grew up, we were all trying to survive, and I understand what these kids are going through.”

He also owned and bred racehorses, one of whom, Sensitive Prince, finished sixth in the 1978 Kentucky Derby.

Mr. Taub is survived by his wife, the former Arlene Gorelick, who was a teacher before they married; his daughter, Michelle Tesser; his son, Marc; six grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. Another daughter, Sandra, died in 2006. His brother, Henry, died in 2011.

In 2009, before a game at the Izod Center (the former Byrne Arena), he talked about the difficulties of owning a team in the New Jersey Meadowlands and competing with the New York Knicks.

“New Jersey is not New York — it’s rural and you really have to market to the corporations,” he told The New York Times, reflecting on playing there. “In the beginning, we sold a lot of season tickets, but everything upstairs felt too far away, not close like Madison Square Garden.”","Joe Taub, Basketball Fan Who Became Part Owner of the Nets, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/obituaries/joe-taub-basketball-fan-who-became-part-owner-of-the-nets-dies-at-88.html

In my book “Supreme Injustice,” I once again challenged Justice Scalia.
Liberal constitutional lawyers will continue to debate Justice Scalia many years after his death, because when it comes to jurisprudence, he was the most transformative jurist of our generation.
“Scalia Speaks” gives us a glimpse of the man, as I came to know and respect him, despite — no, because of — our arguments.","That’s who he was: an intellectual warrior. The back-and-forth was contentious, though sprinkled with his signature humor. I confronted him with hard cases. He responded by demanding that I come up with a better methodology than his own for applying constitutional law. The students called it a tie, giving me, I suspect, the benefit of home court.

Our back-and-forth continued over the years: at faculty lunches, in Israel, in arguments before the Supreme Court, in books, articles and letters — and in personal conversations. He once, quite appropriately, chided me for my “chutzpah” — one of his favorite Yiddishisms — for challenging him to debate Catholic theology after he had implied in an article that neither the Constitution nor Catholic doctrine would be violated by the execution of an innocent defendant, as long as he had been given due process! The closest he ever came to complimenting me was when he wrote, “You are not as nasty a guy as my right-wing friends believe.” Nor was he as nasty as some of my left-wing friends believe, despite the surliness he occasionally insisted on inserting into some of his judicial opinions.

Reading “Scalia Speaks” — the marvelous collection of his speeches, lovingly compiled by his son and a former law clerk — brought Nino back to life for me. His words, even when read, are provocations to argue, disagree and think. They cannot be read passively. They cry out for dialogue. They demand answers — or surrender.

So here are my answers, to which, in fairness to my departed opponent, I try to append what he might have said in rebuttal.

The central thrust of Justice Scalia’s speeches — indeed of his entire judicial career — was an attack on the concept of a “living Constitution” that “evolves” over time to meet the changing needs of the public. He insisted on going “back to the good, old dead Constitution,” as he once put it in an NPR interview. In the speeches contained in this book, he uses the slightly less inflammatory term “static Constitution.” But it comes down to the same point. Here in Justice Scalia’s words:

“Let me begin by telling you what originalism is. The Constitution, as you know, contains a number of broad provisions, which are necessarily vague in their application: due process of law, equal protection of the laws, cruel and unusual punishments, the freedom of speech, to name a few. Originalism gives to those terms the meaning they were understood to have when the people adopted them. Is the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment? A hard question, perhaps, for the non-originalist. I have sat with four colleagues who thought it was. But for the originalist the answer is easy: At the time the people ratified the Eighth Amendment — the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause — no one thought it forbade the death penalty.”

The same would be true of “equal protection” and other broad provisions of the Constitution.

So, in my classroom debate with the justice, I challenged him with the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ended racial segregation of public schools in the Southern states. As a matter of indisputable historic fact, following the Civil War the “people” who “adopted” the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment had to take into account what would surely be the continued segregation of public schools, and not only in the Deep South. Had they suggested that the Equal Protection Clause meant the immediate end of all segregated public education, the amendment itself would never have become a reality. All that the proponents — even the most radical among them — could hope for was that over time, attitudes toward racial differences would “evolve” and that the powerful words “equal protection of the laws” would eventually be interpreted to require public schools to be equal and not separate, instead of “separate but equal” as the Supreme Court had permitted in 1896.

I asked Justice Scalia, whether if had he been on the court in 1954, he could have joined the unanimous court without violating his principle of originalism. He was both candid and self-effacing in his response, saying that no theory of constitutional interpretation — including originalism — was perfect. But he still insisted that originalism was “better” and “safer” than any other theory, because it precluded honest judges from substituting their own philosophies for those of the founding generation. In his own provocative words: “Show Scalia the original meaning, and he is prevented from imposing his nasty, conservative views upon the people. He is handcuffed. And if he tries to dissemble, he will be caught out.”

But was he really handcuffed?

Consider the monumental case of Bush v. Gore, which may have decided the 2000 presidential election. In my book “Supreme Injustice,” I once again challenged Justice Scalia. I showed that until Bush v. Gore, Justice Scalia had taken an extremely narrow view of “equal protection,” rejecting the notion that judges should depart from its original understanding in the 14th Amendment as referring to racial inequality. He had railed against imposing “progressively higher degrees” of equality in other contexts. He wrote that when a practice “not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down.” In so writing, Justice Scalia could easily have been describing Florida’s practice of allowing manual recounts in the case of contested election results. But when Bush v. Gore came before the court, he voted to strike down this recount process as violative of — you guessed it — the Equal Protection Clause, citing the unfairness of imposing “arbitrary and disparate treatment” to ballots throughout the state.

I was surprised, though I shouldn’t have been, when Justice Scalia responded to my calling him out on this inconsistency in a letter that acknowledged the problem, with a touch of humility and humor:

“If my joining the equal-protection opinion was a mistake, I will be delighted if it is the worse one I make on the job.... I have frankly not revisited the issue, or read the extensive commentary (mostly critical, I gather) concerning it. At the time, however, I thought that ground correct. Even if you think that was wrong, considering the severe time constraints, the pressure to come out with a near-unanimous opinion, and the fact that it did not determine my vote in the case, you should cut me some slack.”

I had also criticized him for granting the stay that effectively ended the recount and the election, pointing out that he routinely voted against granting stays even in capital punishment cases. He responded: “As for the stay: I think I can persuade you it was proper. We will talk about it some time — as you say, before senility.”

We did get to talk about it, but the argument persisted.

Liberal constitutional lawyers will continue to debate Justice Scalia many years after his death, because when it comes to jurisprudence, he was the most transformative jurist of our generation. His views cannot be ignored. That is his enduring legacy. But he was more than an influential justice. He was a great man, who lived life to the fullest — as a devout Catholic, a proud Italian-American, a devoted family man, a loyal friend, and a person of humor and culture who fondly remembered his roots in Queens and New Jersey. “Scalia Speaks” gives us a glimpse of the man, as I came to know and respect him, despite — no, because of — our arguments.","Antonin Scalia’s Speeches, Collected for Argument’s Sake",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/antonin-scalia-speaks-speeches-alan-dershowitz.html

That result was no surprise to Mark Scheffler, the director of news for The New York Times’s video unit, which worked to uncover what really happened in Khan Sheikhoun. “You had the Russians and the Syrians telling a story about what happened in this location,” he said. “And the reporting, the work that the team did on that, really debunked it.”

After the attack, two of Mr. Scheffler’s team members, the senior story producer Malachy Browne and the video editor Natalie Reneau, pieced together satellite imagery, photographs and videos of the attack, drone footage and more into a seven-minute video examining the strike.

It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens.

The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.

The New York Times is part of the group of more than 380 journalists from over 90 media organizations in 67 countries that have spent months examining the latest set of documents.

As with the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers leak came through a duo of reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and was then shared with I.C.I.J., a Washington-based group that won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the millions of records of a Panamanian law firm. The release of that trove of documents led to the resignation of one prime minister last year and to the unmasking of the wealth of people close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points. It’s a pattern up and down the ballot.

The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year. In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trump’s strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clinton’s showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.

Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite. Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.

The party out of power has generally won the Virginia governor’s race, and Republicans have underperformed in this year’s special elections. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot. These conditions are consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that swept Democrats into power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010.

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent. These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys — perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.

The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and it’s weighted to a likely electorate. It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governor’s race. But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results. The Democratic strength among well-educated voters — and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race — gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.

About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters. Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters. Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were “almost sure” or “very likely” to vote.

How the Poll Has Changed

The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clinton’s support in the decisive battleground states.

Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.

But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls. The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.

But a close analysis of last year’s surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last November’s election.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census’ Current Population Survey. There’s considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.

It’s not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys. That’s because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.

The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.

Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters. Similarly, the modeled turnout score — our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures — now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016. The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents’ answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.

Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016. (That may not be generalizable to other elections.)

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:",The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The North Korean nuclear threat is at the top of the agenda.

But Mr. Xi still resists totally abandoning this old “fraternal” ally — once said to be as “close as lips and teeth.”

Private talks between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump could clarify what Beijing would expect if the North Korean regime were to collapse. Beijing would argue for the removal of the United States missile-defense system in South Korea, for a ban on American troops north of the demilitarized zone and ultimately a possible withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea.

When it comes to trade and investment, the two countries also have common interests that urgently need readjusting. American patronage has afforded China many special dispensations that have helped its economy boom over the past three decades. But now that China has had such success, it’s time to level the playing field.

Mr. Trump should press China to end practices like requiring that proprietary American technology be transferred to Chinese companies as a condition of doing business in the country, rampant theft of intellectual property and the refusal to let American companies into major sectors of the Chinese economy (like telecommunications, media and banking). Beijing must take action on these fronts to build trust with Washington and establish a more reciprocal relationship.

At the very least, whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi make progress on North Korea or these economic issues, the two leaders should agree to form a high-level working group, led on each side by someone trusted by each president, to take a defined time period of several months to agree on a specific “road map” of possibilities for more collaboration.

At the end of the group’s allotted time, the two presidents could meet at a relaxed venue to adopt the group’s recommendations. Such a forward-looking plan would make the summit meeting a success.

If a working group convened and eventually failed, the United States would at least know that closer cooperation in the Xi-Trump era was unlikely. This would position Washington to take a harder line against Beijing and justify moves like increased freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea; more military support for South Korea, Japan and Taiwan; building closer military alliances with countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Australia and India; and putting greater controls on Chinese investments in the United States.

Mr. Trump, with his penchant for deal-making and his relatively weak political position, may be tempted to accept whatever he can get in Beijing for the sake of appearances. He could easily end up becoming a mere prop used to enhance Mr. Xi’s stature, and getting little in return.

Your character in “Mother!” was meant to be Eve. Did you think of her that way?

[Darren Aronofsky] was very careful not to make those references to us. I was just a woman who was still, after all these years, madly in love with my husband, and who is having a lot of family difficulties. A very real, very human place. And every now and then I would give Jen a really weird look [laughs loudly], just because.

Do you have to like your characters?

I have to find a way to like them. The character I found the most difficult was [the murderous mother in] “White Oleander.” She was evil. I couldn’t find anything to relate to. I remember counting the days that I didn’t have to be in [her] skin.

Ruth [Madoff] is very heroic in her own way. She’s a survivor. I understood completely her love for her family and devotion to those children, to her husband. That was really the crux of that character. We weren’t able to tell her story because it’s the Bernie Madoff story, but I actually encouraged her one day to tell it. But I understand why she wouldn’t want to.

Photo

Are there physical qualities about characters that you find difficult?

Absolutely, I never wanted to see that cat suit again. [After the 2007 fantasy film] “Stardust,” it’s like, never prosthetics to my face. My face was completely encapsulated; it was just so claustrophobic. It was maybe the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been.

Would you have done a Catwoman movie?

Are you kidding me? In a heartbeat. I loved that part. I felt like I was just getting comfortable and getting used to the claws and the mask, just figuring out how to move in all of that. There was a little bit of talk about that, then that kind of faded away.

Does it feel natural to get back to acting after time off, or do you have to warm up those muscles?

I had been off maybe five years, and I did “I Could Never Be Your Woman” with Paul Rudd, and I really felt rusty. I was surprised because I never felt like that. So I haven’t actually taken that much time off since then. I’m enjoying [acting] now more than I ever have, actually. Maybe because I don’t watch dailies anymore. I’m not really eager to look at my films. I’ll look at them once and not usually ever again. It’s better for me because I’m very critical and scrutinizing.

Photo

Some actors believe they should withhold a little bit on screen, so that the audience wants more of them.

Maybe I should try that. I don’t feel like I withhold, but I may not know that because I’m a little withholding as a person, so my gauge might be a bit off. I feel like I’m exuding all kinds of things. My husband has such an active inner world, the writer in him, that I think a lot of times he feels like he’s communicating to me when it’s just in his head. It makes me nuts. [Laughs]

You’ve said that you’re happiest when you’re working, so how did you find balance when you weren’t?

I tinker. I’m an oil painter — usually figure and portrait. I like to build things. I get out my tools, my hammer and my electric drill. When the kids were young I built them a playhouse. I redid the front of one of my fireplaces. I got this idea, I went into Home Depot or something, like, ‘Hey, I want to redo my fireplace, can you guys tell me how to do that?’ They looked at me like, what?

When you took a pause from acting, was it also because the roles were thin?

It seemed like it was harder and harder to say yes, and the roles didn’t warrant leaving my family. I didn’t want to disrupt their routine over and over again, so I started being very picky about when I worked, where, how long I was away, so it limited my choices. It may be that I just also didn’t want to work on a subliminal level. After five years I started to really yearn for the work and even my kids were saying, ‘Mom, aren’t you going to go back to work?’ Which kind of hurt my feelings.

Around the time we started looking at colleges, I realized how it was going to hit me really hard [to have an empty nest] and that I better get something going. I really need to feel like I’m creating something and that my life has meaning. I’m not just going to start playing bridge.

Early on, you said you had the guts to act because you weren’t afraid to fail. Do you still feel that way? Some people think failure is a building block.

It is for sure. And I’m always afraid of failing. Every new part I do I’m afraid I’m going to fail. I’m afraid I’m disappointing my director and you should have gotten someone else. I said to Steve Kloves [the writer-director of “The Fabulous Baker Boys”] when I started “Murder,” I said, “I’m ruining the film.” He laughed.

Why did you think that?

It’s challenging doing a period piece like that. The character is much more extroverted than I am, and so you have to really push yourself outside your comfort zone. It just takes jumping into the deep end, but it’s hard to trust that in the beginning. And so I was at that stage and I’m acting in front of Judi Dench, and I’m thinking O.K., you cannot bomb in front of Judi Dench. This just can’t happen.

[She’s] salty but salt-of-the-earth. She exudes this warmth; she’s lovely. When I met her, I just cried.

In front of her?

Yeah, tears coming down my face. Wah. I was just completely star-struck and moved by meeting her.

Did they have to cajole you to sing?

They didn’t, but they didn’t give me a lot of time to prepare. I got an email from Ken, and he was like, ‘I have this wacky idea, how would you like to sing this song?’ I haven’t sung since “Hairspray,” my vocal cords are rusted shut. I said, ‘I’ll give it a try, but you better have a backup.’ I don’t really consider myself a singer. I consider myself an actor who can sing just good enough in movies. If I really trained, I could be much better.

Do you feel an artist should reflect society or push ideas forward — or both? Do you feel any responsibility to do that?

I do. It’s because of owning that responsibility that I’ve actually passed on a number of projects that were very hard to turn down. I certainly don’t want to be putting out any more toxicity. I wouldn’t want to do anything, for instance, that was misogynistic.

When I did Elvira for “Scarface,” that was a very misogynistic relationship and that character obviously was pathetic. She was just an armpiece for her man. But by playing that part, you actually can say more sometimes than by getting up on your soapbox. I think it’s all in the way that’s presented. But I am always aware of that. Even at that [early] point.

Did you have any trepidation coming back now? There’s a lot more social-media scrutiny.

The only trepidation was I think I took for granted how nice it was to not be under the spotlight and just having a life. I remember thinking, ‘Do I really want to step back into this?’ And I just realized that I’m not done. I have a lot more to do, and a lot more to say.

The world’s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn’t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.

The industry is not willing to wait. Companies are developing all sorts of tools that will make it easier for any operation to build its own A.I. software, including things like image and speech recognition services and online chatbots.

“We are following the same path that computer science has followed with every new type of technology,” said Joseph Sirosh, a vice president at Microsoft, which recently unveiled a tool to help coders build deep neural networks, a type of computer algorithm that is driving much of the recent progress in the A.I. field. “We are eliminating a lot of the heavy lifting.”

This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.

This is most likely what Google has in mind for AutoML, as the company continues to hail the project’s progress. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, boasted about AutoML last month while unveiling a new Android smartphone.

Eventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don’t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.

“We want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,” he said.

Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services — services that help other businesses build and run software — which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world’s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.

Neural networks are rapidly accelerating the development of A.I. Rather than building an image-recognition service or a language translation app by hand, one line of code at a time, engineers can much more quickly build an algorithm that learns tasks on its own.

By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.

But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-François Gagné, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as “a new kind of computer programming.”

In building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a “dark art,” just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.

But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.

Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.

This is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around. But it is part of a significant trend in A.I. research. Experts call it “learning to learn” or “meta-learning.”

Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.

“Computers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,” said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. “Algorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly — at least that is the hope.”

This is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.

Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. “It is just a matter of when,” he said.",Building A.I.

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

Learn how your house works and you may find that maintenance is something you actually – gasp — enjoy. “For me, it’s been such a great love affair,” said Judy E. Mendoza, 69, a saleswoman for Halstead who has lived in a three-bedroom house in East Hampton for 27 years and starts preparing for winter in July. “I’ve enjoyed taking care of the house, and the house has taken care of me.”

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, declined to endorse the mayor for re-election, but, tellingly, it did not endorse any of his opponents, either.

Now, with violent crime on the rise in some of the country’s largest cities and President Trump apparently encouraging police aggression, Mr. de Blasio is hoping to make his mark on public safety in New York City and beyond with a policing experiment on a massive scale — to make officers nicer.

Among the ways to see how the effort is working is to spend time with the officers who are trying to execute it, and the people in the city’s neighborhoods with whom they are trying to connect. So far, the record has been mixed and mostly anecdotal.

Mr. de Blasio has promoted two prongs of this approach to local and national audiences: officers engaging in deeper outreach with residents and, at the same time, looking inward to the internal biases they maintain. The mayor is convinced that the crime numbers and a declining number of official citizen complaints about the police prove that the changes have already taken hold.

“We’re bringing into this city neighborhood policing, real neighborhood policing, cops walking the beat again,” he said in a 2016 television interview in Philadelphia, with the stage of the Democratic National Convention behind him. “One thing that’s crucially important is implicit bias training. Helping our police understand, like every human being, they have biases that we can overcome.”

On the ground, however, things look different than how they have been portrayed by the mayor. Officers do not walk a beat and are not expected to. Neighborhood meetings organized by newly trained “neighborhood coordination officers” are sparsely attended in many cases, and sometimes not attended at all. Firm metrics do not exist for measuring the new approach, which city officials call neighborhood policing and not community policing, which for some officers carries a stigma of laxity and past failure.

And despite Mr. de Blasio’s promise nearly two years ago in his State of the City address to begin implicit bias training for officers that spring, and repeated invocations of the idea since then, the Police Department has yet to train a single officer. A $4.5 million contract for the training is still being completed.

“We have implicit bias training now as part of our curriculum,” the mayor said in July 2016. Last month in a conversation with students at Columbia University, Mr. de Blasio conceded that it had still not yet begun. “We’re starting implicit bias training soon,” he said.

A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, Austin Finan, said the department tried to start the training internally before turning to outside help.

A New ‘Philosophy’

The slow beginnings contrasted with swift and sweeping changes that the Police Department has undertaken to carry out the new patrolling plan.

Fifty-one of the city’s 77 precincts have been carved into new subsections where patrol officers spend all their time. Specialized units tasked with addressing crime, known as conditions teams, are being scuttled in favor of these groups of neighborhood-based officers. Arrests are not only declining, they are being played down by supervisors and chiefs. At crime-trend meetings in Police Headquarters, numbers are out; explanations of how community concerns are being addressed are in.

“For the commanders, they were worried,” said Chief of Patrol Terence A. Monahan, who oversees the effort, which he calls an overarching new “philosophy,” more than a single program. “It took a little pushing to get this going. But they saw the results.”

The Police Department added hundreds of counterterrorism officers under Mr. de Blasio, a priority at a time when Paris, London and last week, New York, have been targets of attacks involving trucks.

How much the drop this year can be attributed to the new approach is unknown. Citywide, the seven major felony crimes — murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny and auto theft — tracked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined by nearly 6 percent.

An analysis of precinct-by-precinct crime data through Oct. 22 by The New York Times showed that those with the program — anywhere from a few months to more than two years — saw declines of nearly 7 percent; those without declined more slowly, a little over 4 percent. Yet at the same time, crime has increased in some of the first neighborhoods to get the program, including in parts of the northern Bronx and Washington Heights.

Even less certain is whether the new approach, meant as a lasting balm for minority neighborhoods rattled by decades of harsh policing tactics, will heal the rifts that reopened in 2014 with the police killing of Eric Garner on Staten Island and the national protests over similar killings of unarmed black men by officers in Baltimore, Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere.

“That’s sort of like the secret ingredient in McDonald’s or something,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national group. “The magic sauce, you know, ‘build trust,’ like, if we could figure out how to do that it would be like the Manhattan Project. How do you build trust?”

Complaints by citizens, often proportional to police enforcement activity, are down from four years ago, as are stop-and-frisk encounters, summonses and arrests.

Chief Monahan said overall arrests were falling faster in precincts with the new program.

Meeting With Residents

That would not surprise Detective Edwin A. Rodriguez, a neighborhood-based officer. Part of his strategy for gaining trust in areas of Washington Heights is to let some crimes go unpunished. In one instance, he let a marijuana dealer go, and later that dealer helped with information on gangs.

“He’s up there selling weed and stuff, a bunch of small stuff,” he said before heading out on patrol on a Friday last month. “And we’re worried about violent stuff.”

Over the summer, a new phase of the plan began around the city: small neighborhood meetings, often with coffee and cupcakes, aimed at helping officers learn the crime concerns in their small patrol areas, known as sectors.

Local commanders are not present, as they would be at the traditional precinct community council meetings. The meetings are run by the neighborhood-based officers, not supervisors.

In the basement of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in the northern Bronx on a recent Thursday night, an officer brought pizzas. His colleagues wrote the concerns of residents on a white sketch pad.

A man stood to complain about drug use in a playground. Others spoke of unlicensed cabs and double-parked cars. But the officers perked up as a woman described a problem at a business.

“They put their drugs right there in the Chinese place, I can tell you that,” the woman said, one of 17 mostly older residents who came to the church. “I’m not trying to get my name involved,” she added.

“Let’s talk after,” one officer, Detective Alejandro Colon, told her, before turning to the group. “This is what this program is all about.”

But not all meetings are as active. In more than a dozen visited by The Times over the last few months, several were sparsely attended, one in Harlem included no one from the area and another in Washington Heights, listed on the website for a June evening, did not take place.

“I was going to speak my mind,” said Orlando Ramos, 69, a retired doorman who was outside the designated location.

By contrast, more than 40 people at a meeting in Bedford-Stuyvesant told officers about problem spots, and officers explained, in an informal way, the challenges they face: the legal rules of stop-question-and-frisk; the limitations of stopping people from smoking marijuana in privately owned apartment buildings.

“It eased my mind because I realized that they’re aware” of the problems in the area, Odessa Watson, 39, said of the officers.

Officer Patrick Malone, 32, who helped to lead the meeting, said he gave out the number for his city-issued cellphone and received calls from residents at all hours. “It’s good information,” he said.

His sergeant, Shaun Brown, said that while some people wanted to see more officers on foot, “we’re in the car 100 percent of the time.” Despite adding 1,300 officers to the Police Department, for counterterrorism and to facilitate the new neighborhood-based program, they would need far more to cover their area on foot, he said.

Few people under 40-years-old were at the meetings. At several, including one in the Bronx on Thursday, officers implored those who came to bring their younger relatives. Assistant Chief Rodney Harrison said that the department was looking to help neighborhood-based officers reach problematic young people by going “to them” in schools and community centers. They would entice the young people to show up, he said, by offering “some type of gift,” like a sporting goods gift card or movie tickets.

“It’s a fluid philosophy,” said Chief Monahan. “This is all about trusting our cops.” He added that the department did not want officers to make arrests for the sake it.

Pragmatism on Patrols

That message has reached the street.

As Detective Rodriguez walked through a desolate corner of his Upper Manhattan sector this month, near an otherwise empty skateboard park, he and his partner, Detective Thomas W. Troppmann, came upon three men huddled under a footbridge. One had his shirt sleeve rolled up. Another appeared to be cooking heroin.

As the officers approached, the men quickly skirted away, leaving belongings behind.

In another era, the encounter might have ended with an arrest, or at least a formal police stop. But Detectives Rodriguez and Troppmann did not see a case to be made, or much point in locking up clearly drug-addicted men who later admitted they were struggling with heroin addiction.

“Hey, come get your jacket!” Detective Rodriguez called out to the men.

Two turned back, and the officers spoke to them about addiction services. The third, whom the officers suspected of being a dealer, kept walking.",De Blasio Kept Crime Down in First Term. His Next Goal: Nicer Police.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/nyregion/bill-deblasio-police-crime.html

Here are the facts at a glance about the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday, in which a gunman killed at least 26 parishioners. About 20 others were injured. Read the latest complete news story here.

What We Know

• The shooting occurred during morning services at the First Baptist Church. Sutherland Springs, an unincorporated town of 360 people, is about 30 miles from San Antonio. Residents described it as a close-knit community where people don’t lock their doors or cars.

• The Texas Department of Public Safety, in this statement on Twitter, identified the gunman as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. The authorities said he was dressed in black. He was wearing a ballistic vest and carrying tactical gear and multiple rounds of ammunition. The authorities received their first call about the suspect at 11:20 a.m.

• Mr. Kelley had served in the Air Force, but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to the Air Force. This profile describes what is known about his life.

• The gunman’s in-laws had attended services at the church in the past, according to Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County. They were not in town at the time of the shooting, he said. The church is about 35 miles south of Mr. Kelley’s home.

• The gunman exited his vehicle and began firing outside the church. He then walked to the side of the church and then inside, firing all the while, according to Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

• After the gunman exited the church, he exchanged fire with an armed bystander, according to Sheriff Tackitt. The suspect then got in his vehicle while the bystander waved down a man in a vehicle, and the two chased after him.

• The suspect crashed his car in a neighboring county and was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Sheriff Tackitt said. It was not clear whether that wound was fatal or whether the gunman died from other injuries.

• Among the dead were 23 parishioners whose bodies were found inside the church, according to this chronology of the shooting. Two more were found outside and one person died after being transported to a hospital, Gov. Greg Abbott said. He called it “the largest mass shooting in our state’s history.”

• About 20 more were taken to hospitals with injuries varying from minor to very severe.

• The victims, both those who died and those who were injured, ranged in age from 5 to 72, Sheriff Tackitt said. Family members and friends have begun releasing some information about the victims, which include several members of the same family. Read the latest updates here.

What We Don’t Know

• The authorities have not yet released the names of the gunman’s victims, though some names have come to light.

• His motive for the shooting is not yet clear.

• We still do not know how the gunman obtained the firearm he used in the attack.",Texas Church Killings: What We Know and Don’t Know,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/texas-church-killings-what-we-know.html

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html

Now the I.O.C. and Russian officials are engaged in a doping stare down. Many athletes, antidoping officials and Olympics officials from some countries are urging Thomas Bach, president of the I.O.C., to issue severe penalties.

The top Olympic officials are also considering the option of having Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag at the Pyeongchang Games or wear neutral uniforms, according to the people familiar with the case. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The I.O.C. is unlikely to impose a total ban on Russia, an Olympic heavyweight, though it could issue a significant financial penalty, expel athletes and officials found to have been part of the doping scheme and remove any mention of Russia from the field of play, according to the people.

Russian officials have threatened to pull their athletes out of the Pyeongchang Games altogether if the sanctions are too harsh.

A decision is expected to be made on Dec. 5, when the I.O.C’s executive board meets. Before then the officials will receive the results of a much-delayed study by the former Swiss president Samuel Schmid into McLaren’s report, which linked several state organs, including the intelligence agency FSB, to the doping conspiracy.

A group of 17 national antidoping agencies published a letter in September demanding that Russia be excluded from the Pyeongchang Games.

“The failure to expeditiously investigate individual Russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 Winter Games,” said the letter, whose signatories included the United States and British antidoping agencies.

Russia is expected to react with fury, and even withdraw its team from the Winter Games, if the I.O.C. issues a severe punishment. The Pyeongchang Olympics are scheduled to take place about six weeks before President Vladimir Putin stands for re-election.

“The position is unequivocal for all — Russians will not compete under the neutral flag at the Olympic Games,” Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russia’s Olympic committee, said in comments published on the Russian website R-Sport. “They will speak for their country. This option is not even being considered.”

The late rush to settle on a punishment is a repeat of events ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Then, in the wake of Dr. Rodchenkov’s revelations, the I.O.C ordered individual sports federations to determine the eligibility of Russian athletes for those Games. Some, like cycling, rowing and track and field, adopted blanket bans, while others admitted athletes who could prove they were clean.

Last week at a meeting of the 205 eligible Olympic nations and territories, Bach said that any manipulation of samples at Sochi would constitute a “direct attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on the I.O.C.” But since the start of the crisis he has emphasized his opposition to “collective punishment,” preferring that each athlete have a chance to establish his innocence.

Bach has forcefully pushed back at calls for the I.O.C. to act more swiftly against Russia. He has said that punishments cannot be determined before the I.O.C.’s inquiries had been completed. The I.O.C. also commissioned an investigation by the head of its disciplinary commission, Denis Oswald, into possible doping violations by individual athletes at the Sochi, London and Beijing Games.

“In the Olympic movement everybody — when we say everybody it is everybody — everybody enjoys the same rights and obligations and everyone enjoys the right to a fair and due procedure,’’ Bach said. “I call all of you to respect this fair procedure for all our colleagues, because we always think how you would react if you were accused of some wrongdoings and what you would expect from your colleagues.”

No winter sports federation has publicly supported a total ban of Russian athletes at the Pyeongchang Games.

Last week the I.O.C penalized the first two athletes following Oswald’s investigation. The Russian cross country skiers Alexander Legkov and Evgeniy Belov were banned for life for doping violations at the Sochi Games.

Dr. Rodchenkov said Russia tampered with urine samples that would have failed drug tests in Sochi. Oswald’s commission has taken longer than first anticipated to reach verdicts after it struggled to come up with a suitable method of detecting whether bottles — previously considered tamper-proof — had been manipulated.

McLaren’s report captured the scale and audaciousness of Russia’s doping program, using forensic analysis to corroborate the testimony of Dr. Rodchenkov. The report said the drug tests of about 1,000 athletes — across several Olympics — were corrupted, but acknowledged that proving wrongdoing for individual cases would be difficult given Russia’s lack of cooperation in providing lab data and its history of destroying tainted urine samples that would be plainly incriminating.

The World Anti-Doping Agency has cleared 95 of the first 96 athletes whose cases of doping in competitions have been reviewed.

The agency in 2015 declared Russia noncompliant with global sports’ accepted antidoping code. Among several requirements for regaining compliance, the agency said, Russian antidoping authorities must publicly accept the findings in McLaren’s report and the Russian government must provide access to the stored urine samples in the Moscow laboratory.

Russia has not fulfilled either of those demands yet. Russian officials have cited an ongoing FSB investigation for refusing WADA access to lab samples and data.

In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who can’t stop making bad puns (“I don’t want to sound like your mummy but …”), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy. The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brooks’s classic sendups of the conventions of comedy.

Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesn’t mean they aren’t peculiar. Mr. O’Brien’s brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew. Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances. But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched. The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame.

While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen. A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers. But they won’t age well, and Mr. O’Brien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.

This even extends to how Mr. O’Brien handles politics. While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities. Mr. O’Brien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years.

Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.

Earlier this year, there were rumors that “Conan” was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule. But here’s hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect.

China plans to return the favor when Mr. Trump arrives Wednesday for what the Chinese Foreign Ministry says is his first visit to Beijing. The Chinese are calling it “a state visit-plus,” promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City.

The welcome is designed to make Mr. Trump feel important, reflecting the belief of at least some Chinese officials that they know just how to handle an outspoken tycoon with a big ego.

But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his “China Dream” — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world.

Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a “new type of great power relations,” the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.

The concept is closely associated with Mr. Xi, who has been pitching it since he was vice president. But the Obama administration viewed it as code for allowing China to establish a sphere of influence in Asia, with the United States withdrawing to minimize conflict.

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told state news media last week he hoped Mr. Trump’s visit would revive the idea and allow the two nations to build a “constructive partnership.” The vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, said the two leaders would discuss a “blueprint” for developing relations.

Chinese analysts believe the timing works to Mr. Xi’s advantage. Mr. Trump will be arriving as he faces new questions about the Russia investigation at home and criticism abroad for appearing to abandon American leadership on issues from climate change to trade liberalization.

In contrast, Mr. Xi has been basking in the aftermath of a party congress last month that elevated him to the same status as the nation’s founding father, Mao Zedong.

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Xi has positioned China as a stable alternative to the United States, willing to take on the obligations of global leadership and invest in big infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe much as the United States did after World War II.

“China, for the first time, is not in a humble position regarding the United States,” said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Usually the American president has the advantage. This is the first time there is an equal relationship between the two leaders.”

Mr. Xi is now the unquestioned paramount leader of China, Professor Yan added, while Mr. Trump only “represents himself.”

Asked on Sunday about the disparity, Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States. “We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Xi may also be counting on personal chemistry between the two men. They appeared to bond when they first met at Mr. Trump’s Florida estate in April, and Mr. Trump has since called Mr. Xi numerous times, often to ask him to get tougher on North Korea.

In interviews, Mr. Trump has frequently praised Mr. Xi and described him as a friend, often in effusive terms unusual for an American president speaking of the leader of China’s authoritarian, one-party state. At times, Mr. Trump has even repeated points made by Mr. Xi in their conversations.

Still, Chinese officials, known for their attention to detail and protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries, appear to be somewhat on edge over what Mr. Trump might say, and how he might say it, during the visit.

Twitter is blocked in China, but it is generally accessible on foreign cellphones. “How President Trump communicates with the outside — this is not something you need to worry about,” said Mr. Zheng, the vice minister, when asked if the American president would be able to use his favorite social media platform.

Beijing’s anxieties about the visit are due at least in part to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s view of China.

Mr. Trump’s call to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific” emphasizing Australia, India and Japan echoes the view of the national security establishment in Washington that China’s growing clout in Asia must be managed or even contained.

But Mr. Trump has also embraced those who say the United States must take a much tougher position on trade with China, including Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. They say that Beijing is exploiting America’s openness while keeping its own markets closed, and Washington must insist on reciprocity even at the risk of a trade war.

This clashes with a third view in the administration, often associated with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that considers China an inseparable economic partner and business opportunity for the United States.

Photo

Mr. Kushner served as go-between in arranging the president’s first meeting with Mr. Xi but has taken a lower profile since then, in part, officials have said, because of concerns about his efforts to bring Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures.

John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, tilted the White House away from criticism of Beijing in an interview on Fox News last week, saying China had beaten the United States on trade but “that doesn’t make them an enemy.”

He also said that China has “a system of government that has apparently worked for the Chinese people.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The remarks drew heckles from many in Washington who cited China’s human rights record but praise from the Chinese news media as reflecting the more equal relationship that Mr. Xi seeks.

Mr. Trump’s top concern is expected to be North Korea and its nuclear arsenal, and many analysts believe Mr. Xi will use the potential for greater Chinese pressure on North Korea to draw Mr. Trump closer to embracing a “great power” relationship.

“As Trump needs Xi’s help with the North Korean challenge and as he is not a traditional realist, he may agree, to the chagrin of his advisers,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.

Accepting China as a partner has been a fraught proposition for Mr. Trump’s predecessors. When former President Bill Clinton agreed to work toward “ a constructive strategic partnership in the 21st century,” he was criticized for cozying up to China just a few years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Two decades later, human rights in China remains a potential point of friction, with some in the administration lobbying Mr. Trump to press Mr. Xi on the fate of Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in July after eight years in prison.

Like the Obama administration in its latter years, though, Mr. Trump has not made a priority of such issues, even as Mr. Xi has conducted a sweeping crackdown on civil society.

Each location has only recently experienced an unthinkable tragedy at the hands of a mass murderer and his guns. The latest, in the small Texas town, involved a man reportedly using a rifle to kill at least 26 people while they worshipped. Beyond these tragedies, which understandably seize the public’s attention, are dozens more in cities around America – nearly one per day.

Still, Republican leaders in Congress do nothing. Or, really, so far they’ve done the same thing they have always done: offered thoughts and prayers. Soon, they will surely offer warnings not to “politicize” a tragedy by debating gun controls that might prevent such mass killings from happening again.

“We are not going to talk about that today,” President Trump told reporters in the days that followed the Las Vegas shooting, where 58 people were killed.

“I think it’s premature to be discussing legislative solutions if there are any,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said.

If now is too soon to debate gun control, how long must Americans wait?

Since the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex. 26 killed

When Republican leaders have responded to past killings, their response was to block sensible, useful gun control. They should not be allowed to delay effective legislation any longer. Too many days have passed, from one tragedy to the next. This is the time.

To Republicans in Congress who might feel uneasy about responding to this tragedy with laws that might prevent the next one, we offer this grim reference. Rather than responding to Sutherland Springs, act as though the legislation was responding to the mass shootings in Las Vegas, Dallas, Orlando, San Bernardino, Colorado Springs, Roseburg, Chattanooga, Charleston, Marysville, Isla Vista, Fort Hood, Santa Monica, or Sandy Hook Elementary School, to name a few.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

At least 26 people were killed when a man opened fire during a service at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday.

The gunman, who has been identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, died shortly after the attack.

The people who were shot ranged in age from 5 to 72, the authorities said on Sunday. Among the dead were several children, a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. Of the people who died, 23 of them were found dead inside the church, two were found outside, and one died later at a hospital.

At least 20 more were wounded.

The authorities have not yet released the identities of the shooting victims. But family members and friends in the close-knit, small town of Sutherland Springs have begun to share stories about the people who were shot.

We will continue to update this article as more names are released.

Members of the Holcombe family

Scott Holcombe, 30, and his sister Sarah Slavin, 33, said that their father, Bryan Holcombe, and their mother, Karla Holcombe, had been killed. Bryan Holcombe had been guest preaching at the church, they said.

Scott Holcombe said that his pregnant sister-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, had also been killed.

Mr. Holcombe and his sister sat together outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, Tex., on Sunday night.

“This is unimaginable,” he said. “My father was a good man, and he loved to preach. He had a good heart.”

Members of the Ward family

Sandy Ward, a parishioner at the church who had stayed home on Sunday, said that a daughter-in-law and three of her grandchildren were shot. Her grandson, who is 5, was shot four times and remained in surgery Sunday night.

Mr. Taylor reportedly suggested that the director try Albert Finney instead, but Mr. Tarantino said his heart was set on Mr. Taylor and the actor accepted.
Mr. Gleeson faced several challenges — he was 15 years younger and far taller than Churchill’s 5 feet 6 inches.
But like many British actors before him, Mr. Gleeson said the biggest obstacle was getting “the idea of him as a hero out of my head.”","The movie also tries to understand Churchill through his use of language, with the sound of typewriters constantly clacking in the background. “They are the most iconic speeches in the history of the English language and they were all written in 28 days, so how these speeches came to be and how he came to express the will and the sentiment of the nation is really the subject,” Mr. Wright added.

In one of the most stirring scenes, Churchill famously addresses the House of Commons, arguing that the British need to face the Nazi threat at all costs: “If we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, ‘This was their finest hour.’”

Speaking those words is a dream for actors, but the role also represents an enormous risk, Mr. Oldman said, where you could easily slip into caricature. “He’s quite often portrayed as old, grumpy, a curmudgeon. Lugubrious and grunting and shouting,” Mr. Oldman said. “That’s how I’ve seen him played and I think that contaminated my own thinking about him.”

To get at the man beneath those cigar-puffing, jowly stereotypes, enhanced by makeup, Mr. Oldman spent four months researching and preparing for the role — watching footage, reading his many works and those of biographers like Martin Gilbert and even the politician Boris Johnson. He visited Churchill’s family homes, Chartwell and Blenheim Palace, and talked to people who knew him. “I discovered a man who was not as fat as we all thought he was in 1940 and who had really an athletic tread. He skipped around and he had this sort of stoop and it was forward moving,” Mr. Oldman said, adding, “There’s a real twinkle in the eye, and he has humor. The Churchill I saw and I discovered had charm.”

Mr. Oldman also spent time in the war rooms in Westminster where those fateful decisions were made, and sat in the great man’s chair. “On the left-hand arm of the chair were these marks where he had made scratches with his nails,” the actor recalled. “And on the right-hand side were scratches from his ring that he used to wear. He was in this chair throughout the war, so you can imagine the stress and strain that he was under.”

What many people now fail to realize, he added, is “how precariously close he came to disaster” and that he was himself resistant to war. “His most powerful and beautiful words were about the horror of war.”

With “Darkest Hour,” Mr. Oldman now joins a long line of actors who have played Churchill, including Albert Finney, Richard Burton and even a satire featuring Christian Slater. Here’s a look at a few other memorable turns.

Brian Cox, ‘Churchill’ (2017)

In Jonathan Teplitzky’s recent film, Mr. Cox plays Churchill opposite Miranda Richardson as his devoted wife, Clemmie, during the 96 hours leading up to D-Day. Mr. Cox’s Churchill, one reviewer in The Telegraph wrote, was “a distant cousin of a brown bear, or a Hereford bull, snuffling and stalking through his subterranean Whitehall war rooms, champing at underlings and barking at his reflection.”

John Lithgow, ‘The Crown’ (2016)

Mr. Lithgow’s version often comes across as a grandfatherly figure to Claire Foy’s Queen Elizabeth II in this Netflix series. To get into character, he donned a fat suit, a wig and plumpers to swell his jowls. He told The Los Angeles Times, “I never would have chosen myself” for the role. “I’m so different than him. I’m so tall and so American.” Still, his portrayal won him an Emmy in 2017.

Timothy Spall, ‘The King’s Speech’ (2010)

There’s been much debate over what this movie got right and wrong about the rise of George VI — see Christopher Hitchens’s writings for withering criticism. But Mr. Spall proved a welcome addition in a cameo as Churchill. So much so that he was invited to perch atop a fake Big Ben and perform as Churchill giving Caliban’s speech from “The Tempest” at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.

Rod Taylor, ‘Inglourious Basterds’ (2009)

Mr. Taylor, who died in 2015, preferred a bow tie for his portrayal in Quentin Tarantino’s film. Mr. Taylor reportedly suggested that the director try Albert Finney instead, but Mr. Tarantino said his heart was set on Mr. Taylor and the actor accepted.

Brendan Gleeson, ‘Into the Storm’ (2009)

In a sequel to HBO’s award-winning film “The Gathering Storm,” which starred Albert Finney, Mr. Gleeson here plays Churchill recalling in flashback his glory days during the war.

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

She added that journalists’ refusal to brush off those tangents was the truly “outrageous and absurd” development. Thus she aced her favorite trick: the moral inversion of the universe.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Back Story

It is said that history is written by the winners, but sometimes the losers aren’t forgotten.

Sunday was Guy Fawkes Night in England, an annual celebration named after a participant in a plot in 1605 to kill King James I.

Photo

Organized by a group of Catholics, the idea was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.

The men managed to move 36 barrels of gunpowder directly beneath the House of Lords chamber, and Fawkes was responsible for lighting the fuse.

An anonymous letter sent to a Catholic lord warned him to stay away, arousing suspicions, and a search led to the discovery of Fawkes and the gunpowder. He and his conspirators were later executed, but his legacy lives on.

Even today, royal bodyguards make a ceremonial search of the cellars before the State Opening of Parliament, and in a BBC poll in 2002 Fawkes was voted the 30th greatest Briton.

The English celebrate his failure with fireworks, bonfires (topped by an effigy known as a guy) and a bit of folk verse:

“Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. I see no reason gunpowder treason should ever be forgot!”

Qualcomm is likely to quickly reject the bid, believing that it dramatically undervalues the company. It is trying to close its own big acquisition, the $38.5 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductor, a chip maker whose products are becoming important in the internet-of-things ecosystem. (A condition of Broadcom’s offer is that Qualcomm not raise its offer to NXP beyond its current level of $110 a share.)

In a statement on Monday, Qualcomm said only that it was reviewing the Broadcom proposal.

Shares in Qualcomm traded below Broadcom’s offer as of Monday morning, at $63.83, potentially reflecting skepticism from shareholders that the takeover bid will succeed. Shares in Broadcom were little changed.

Though Mr. Tan famously avoids the news media, he took a big step into prominence on Thursday when he appeared with President Trump at the White House to announce that Broadcom would move its legal base to the United States from Singapore. Some analysts have questioned whether that decision was meant to help win political support for a takeover of Qualcomm, which is expected to face tough antitrust scrutiny.

For Qualcomm and its advisers, the biggest issue is likely to be a simple matter of price. Though the company last traded above $70 a share two years ago, its management team believes that the chip maker is poised for a rebound, thanks in part to the NXP acquisition and to a belief that it can prevail in its fight with Apple.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

When Nishiyama, bespectacled and monklike in his movements, grew interested in flower arranging while an art school student, he joined an ikebana club.
This is also true of Emily Thompson, who works out of a corner storefront in Manhattan’s old downtown seaport district.
Like Nishiyama, she has no formal training in ikebana, and yet her work, like his, can’t be understood without it.
“How can [a floral artist] not have a relationship to ikebana?” Thompson says.","The story that best illustrates the tension and interconnectedness of the two approaches is one that involves Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the ruler of Japan, and the Zen tea master Sen no Rikyu in the 16th century. Hideyoshi was known for his lavish, gaudy excess, and under his rule, tatehana, which he adored for its grandeur, had become increasingly more relaxed — libertine really — in its expressions of extravagance. (Hideyoshi once commissioned 40-foot-tall arrangements in 7-foot vases — for him, size definitely counted.) In response, Rikyu developed the wabi form of the tea ceremony, one that prioritized simplicity and slowness over polish, and along with it, advanced the humble nageire style of arrangements for the teahouse interior. Rikyu tried to refine nageire to its essence, evolving the style from an arrangement of several flowers to just one, housed in the most humble and common of containers, like a rice bowl or an earthenware jar. One day, upon hearing that morning glories were in glorious bloom in the garden of Rikyu’s teahouse, Hideyoshi made an appointment to see them. But when he arrived, they had all been cut down. He entered the teahouse and found there a composition of a single morning glory of such exquisiteness that he saw within it the beauty of the entire natural world. Hideyoshi was awed and affronted that his rival had achieved such transcendence, and later, he ordered Rikyu to commit ritual suicide.

FOR TOSHIRO KAWASE, the creative tension inherent in this duality is what creates the artistry in ikebana. Hayato Nishiyama might say the same. The florist lives and works from a small townhouse, which houses his shop, Mitate, in a quiet corner of Kyoto with his wife, Mika. When Nishiyama, bespectacled and monklike in his movements, grew interested in flower arranging while an art school student, he joined an ikebana club. He soon realized, however, that he wanted to study the plants themselves, and so became a gardener. While he has never studied formally, he has read many books on ikebana, including Kawase’s. His work follows in the nageire tradition: He uses exclusively seasonal plants that change form and color throughout the year — bulbs and wildflowers, ferns and grasses, camellias and cherry blossoms that grow in the surrounding hills — and eschews traditional porcelain or bronze vases for everyday objects that he transforms into vessels, like woven bamboo baskets, old wooden well buckets or bits of roofing tile. Traditional ikebana, like the traditional tea ceremony, has many tools — saws and wire and kenzans (spiky flower frogs that hold a plant upright) — but Nishiyama uses only a pair of scissors and works on the floor; he is inspired not just by the seasons, but by the constant change and movement within them. When we visited, it was early fall and he was making an arrangement with red-leaved rowan branches sent from a friend farther north, where autumn was already in full swing, and the last purple asters of Kyoto’s summer — a conversation between what was passing and what was to come. A work Nishiyama has posted on his Instagram feed shows three tiny flowers planted in moss, one in bud, one flowering and one beginning to fade — a tribute to how we are always living in three tenses at once, whether we recognize it or not, and a nod to both the fleetingness and constancy of nature’s cycles.

This emphasis on the brevity of life is one of the fundamental differences between ikebana and Western arrangements, but another is the particular recessiveness of the flower itself. Western arrangements prioritize full-frontal blooms, ripe and bold and staring straight at the viewer. In ikebana, there might not even be a flower in the composition, and if there is, it rarely looks you in the eye: It is more likely bent or turned to the side. Stems or leaves or branches are often emphasized over flowers, and those might very well be crooked or yellowing or covered with moss.

Highlighting overlooked forms of beauty, or revealing something ordinary in a new way, is central to Nishiyama’s vision. This is also true of Emily Thompson, who works out of a corner storefront in Manhattan’s old downtown seaport district. Well-known in the fashion world for her wild, wind-tossed bouquets, she too studied art and is a self-taught florist. Like Nishiyama, she has no formal training in ikebana, and yet her work, like his, can’t be understood without it. Thompson also forages and buys her plants from local farms, but where Nishiyama’s approach is purist, and his work gentle, Thompson’s can be voracious and bold, even aggressive. She culls anything from the natural world that can serve her: exotics, weeds, hairy seed pods, flower leis, dangling clumps of moss, even animal and vegetable matter. (Recent compositions have included a tiered topiary of asparagus spears and a bouquet of purple artichoke with phormium and geranium leaves.)

Whether she is creating a simple arrangement of just a few iris buds in a low bowl or a massive installation of dangling roots, twisted branches and an explosion of milkweed fuzz for a client like the Pool, the new restaurant in New York City, Thompson is always attempting “to build worlds made of the infinite wealth of nature.” As she explains, “I don’t follow any master except for my own powerful sense of responsibility that the flowers should be afforded their own identities.” Her compositions do reflect the seasons — there is a delicacy to her work in spring, a lushness in summer, a decay in fall and a barrenness in winter — and yet they also challenge us to re-see what an arrangement can look like. Thompson’s pieces might at first glance appear chaotic, but eventually, one begins to see the logic that informs them: A grouping of wild greenbrier with branches of white oak seems to blow to one side, as if buffeted by the wind. “My insistence on incorporating flawed materials,” she says, “showing a diseased branch, a rose in all stages or a chrysalis hanging off it, shows that this is not just a product but a living organism.”

This, too, is ikebana, practiced many centuries and miles away from when and where it began. “How can [a floral artist] not have a relationship to ikebana?” Thompson says. “Much as asymmetry is defined by symmetry; ikebana is always in the room when one works with flowers.”

Her work, like Nishiyama’s, is a reminder that like all living arts, ikebana changes and is informed by the culture and the times; what makes ikebana especially poignant and potent in this moment is its direct and personal connection to nature, its awareness of and emphasis on decay in an era in which our own ecological and environmental ruin feels more vivid than ever. A cherry blossom in bloom will soon be gone. But for this instant, it’s ours — and while it is, who among us can turn away from it?",The Rise of Modern Ikebana,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/t-magazine/ikebana-japanese-flower-art.html

This onslaught over issues of culture and identity, a mix of the Trumpian tactics of today with the unvarnished appeals from the past in a state defined by race since Jamestown, has appalled Democrats in Virginia and beyond.

The gut-punch approach has left even some Republicans wincing over the spectacle of a former Republican National Committee chairman and New Jersey native trying to win with earnest vows to guard emblems of the Lost Cause and with warnings about menacing Hispanic gangs.

Yet Mr. Gillespie’s strategy has brought him within a few points of Mr. Northam in both public and private polling. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Northam with just a three-point lead over Mr. Gillespie, 43 percent to 40 percent.

That has forced nervous Democrats to confront the reality that race, immigration and crime can be a potent mix even in a rapidly suburbanizing state where Hillary Clinton won by more than five points last year and where, overall, the president remains deeply unpopular.

“I don’t think it will work in Virginia, but I just don’t know,” said Representative Robert C. Scott, Virginia’s first black congressman since Reconstruction.

Democratic officials have been especially troubled as their ostensible allies have responded with ham-handed scare tactics of their own and demanded that their candidates reject any policies that carry even the whiff of Trumpism.

In an attempt to stir nonwhite voters, and draw attention from the news media and would-be donors, a liberal Hispanic advocacy group released an ad last week depicting a man in a pickup bearing a Gillespie sticker speeding after panicked children of color. The group, the Latino Victory Fund, pulled the commercial down after the deadly truck attack in New York, but not before offering Republicans a rallying cry to motivate their base and forcing Mr. Northam to distance himself from the spot.

At a get-out-the-vote rally Saturday for Mr. Gillespie and the Republican ticket in Fairfax County, a suburb of Washington that is Virginia’s most populous locality, speaker after speaker inveighed against the racially motivated ad, while avoiding any mention of their own standard-bearer’s appeals.

“It is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in politics,” said Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a fellow Republican who ventured across the Potomac for Mr. Gillespie.

While the displays of umbrage illustrated how desperate Republicans are to seize any opening, the dust-up illustrated the determination of some liberals to fight fire with fire, even if it creates a mess for their nominee.

“Will Rogers was never proven wrong,” said Mr. Scott, invoking Rogers’s oft-cited aphorism that, as a Democrat, he belonged to no organized party.

Also worrisome to Democratic strategists was how some elements of the left reacted when Mr. Northam indicated in an interview last week that he would sign a law banning sanctuary cities, localities that offer a blanket of protection from federal immigration authorities. One liberal group, Democracy for America, withdrew its support from Mr. Northam, and a founder of the “resistance” organization Indivisible implored the nominee, who is under fire from Mr. Gillespie for opposing a state measure that would have banned sanctuary cities, to “find your spine.”

The fratricide illustrated how, as Democrats become more organized around their own identity politics, it is growing ever more difficult for their candidates to stray from the liberal line on any issue that veers toward race.

And it was the second time Mr. Northam, a moderate by inclination, equivocated on a racially charged issue in an effort to satisfy liberals and more centrist voters: Earlier in the campaign he said he would lead the effort to take down Confederate statues, only to subsequently say he would defer to local authorities.

In an interview here on Saturday after he stopped at a bustling Asian food hall that featured Hawaiian-style poke bowls, Vietnamese coffee ice cream in ash coconut waffle cones and an ethnic fusion of voters to match, Mr. Northam demonstrated how tricky immigration politics is becoming for his party.

Asked whether those found to be in the country illegally should be deported at all, he repeated the question and then declined to say.

“That’s a federal issue,” said Mr. Northam, a former Army doctor who voted for George W. Bush twice before entering politics, adding that he would “support local law enforcement.”

Veteran Democrats hear such equivocation and see peril ahead.

“If the debate is set up so that Republicans are the only ones who want some sort of order or limitations on immigration and Democrats want zero, we will lose that debate every single day,” said Kenneth Baer, a Democratic strategist. “We need to say that immigration makes the country strong and is at the core of who we are, and this is how we do it: with order, laws and compassion. Unfortunately, Trump is boxing us into being the open borders party, which is not where most of the country is.”

It is unclear how much leeway on immigration the Democratic base will give its office holders. Mr. Northam’s most rousing applause lines have come when he has said that Virginia is a welcoming and inclusive state, whether it was when former President Barack Obama appeared in Richmond for a rally last month or when Mr. Northam addressed a group of Arlington County Democrats last week.

What ultimately may save Mr. Northam on Tuesday, though, was captured by another speaker in Arlington, among the most liberal jurisdictions in the state. “I don’t know about you, but the funk that I have been in since Nov. 8 of last year, it still hasn’t worn off,” said Christian Dorsey, a member of the County Board.

Virginia Democrats, especially in the Washington suburbs, view this election as an exercise in cathartic revenge against Mr. Trump. “Democrats want to send a message,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.

Mr. Gillespie is conscious of giving Democrats the chance to link him directly to Mr. Trump. At the sparsely attended Republican rally in Fairfax County on Saturday, not one speaker mentioned the president’s name. Nor did Mr. Gillespie say a word about the core of his advertising campaign, ignoring the MS-13 gang, felons’ rights and Confederate statues.

Afterward, George Allen, the former Republican governor and senator, noted that Mr. Trump was “off in Asia now.” Indeed, the only hint of the president came via a 20-foot, golden-maned inflatable chicken that Democrats had set up across the street to taunt Mr. Gillespie about his refusal to be seen with Mr. Trump.

But a table filled with the stickers and literature of Republican candidates offered a stark reminder of how Mr. Trump’s adopted party is embracing his politics: A door hanger ready for distribution presented a blurry picture of Mr. Northam and criticized him for backing a state proposal in favor of sanctuary cities, restoring rights to criminals and supporting “taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.”","Avoiding Trump, but Adopting His Divisive Playbook: Will It Work in Virginia?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/virginia-governor-northam-gillespie-race.html

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

Qualcomm is likely to quickly reject the bid, believing that it dramatically undervalues the company. It is trying to close its own big acquisition, the $38.5 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductor, a chip maker whose products are becoming important in the internet-of-things ecosystem. (A condition of Broadcom’s offer is that Qualcomm not raise its offer to NXP beyond its current level of $110 a share.)

In a statement on Monday, Qualcomm said only that it was reviewing the Broadcom proposal.

Shares in Qualcomm traded below Broadcom’s offer as of Monday morning, at $63.83, potentially reflecting skepticism from shareholders that the takeover bid will succeed. Shares in Broadcom were little changed.

Though Mr. Tan famously avoids the news media, he took a big step into prominence on Thursday when he appeared with President Trump at the White House to announce that Broadcom would move its legal base to the United States from Singapore. Some analysts have questioned whether that decision was meant to help win political support for a takeover of Qualcomm, which is expected to face tough antitrust scrutiny.

For Qualcomm and its advisers, the biggest issue is likely to be a simple matter of price. Though the company last traded above $70 a share two years ago, its management team believes that the chip maker is poised for a rebound, thanks in part to the NXP acquisition and to a belief that it can prevail in its fight with Apple.

Mine is succinct:

“Back on Tuesday, September 12.”

No explanations, no apologies, no promises to respond, no redirects to other colleagues. It works.

Kris Shankar:

“I’ll be 1 percent connected while on vacation so I’m not 100 percent panicked on return.”

This reminded me of a time when I shouldn’t have written.

We went to New Zealand and I informed everyone in my OOO that I was “Bungee jumping in Queenstown,” which seemed like what I should do in Queenstown.

When I got there and found out the bungee was 134 feet high I got terrible cold feet, but I felt that since I wrote it, I had to do it. So I did. It was terrifying and indeed a lesson on making bold claims in a public way!

Have a great week!

We have seen this movie before. Sexual harassment complaints to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission increased 73 percent in the year after Anita Hill’s televised testimony about Clarence Thomas’s behavior in 1991. Still, Mr. Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court, while Ms. Hill went quietly back to being a law professor in Oklahoma. In the ensuing years, the issue cycled between headlines and whispers in a seemingly endless loop.

But this sequel seems to have a surprise ending, or at least a plot twist: The public outrage is deeper and more sustained, and the dominoes continue to fall.

Meet Our New Gender Editor .

Maybe it’s that the accusers this time were famous, media-savvy and mostly white actors with more star power than the accused (unlike, say, Paula Jones vs. Bill Clinton). Maybe it’s reflective of a specific period in American history, in which working women of a new generation — those who had grown up with working mothers — decided that enough was enough.

Certainly the endlessly expanding power of social media plays a role: The #metoo hashtag has been used in millions of posts over the past few weeks; been translated into Italian (#QuellaVoltaChe, or “that time when”) and French (#BalanceTonPorc, or “out your pig”); and inspired a congressional spinoff.

Several experts likened it to a dam breaking, the cumulative effect of harassment claims over decades and especially the last few years. Some see it as the other shoe dropping after Donald J. Trump’s taped boasting about offensive behavior did not block his path to the presidency: He may have gotten away with it, but women were no longer going to let that boss, that mentor, that colleague get away with it, too.

“There is no doubt that having an accused sexual predator in the White House is hanging over this,” said Jaclyn Friedman, the author of “Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power, and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All,” scheduled for publication this month. “People feel like they can’t do anything about that right now, but at least they can do something about this.”

An Army of Voices

If you are a woman, or know somebody who is, it’s safe to assume you have talked about Mr. Weinstein at the dinner table, on the subway, in bed, at work, and any other place where people gather. Perhaps you’ve asked your partner, your mother, your boss or your friend for the first time, as I have, if she, too, is among this strange new tribe. (“Who was your Weinstein?” we all suddenly want to know.)

I’ve heard from women who said they’ve retroactively confronted their harassers and those who enabled them, and from men who are re-examining, perhaps somewhat nervously, their own behavior. The new conversation goes way beyond the workplace to sweep in street harassment, rape culture and “toxic masculinity” — terminology that would have been confined to gender studies classes, not found in mainstream newspapers, not so long ago.

“In the women’s movement of the 1970s we had this phrase ‘the click moment,’” Barbara Berg, a historian and the author of the 2009 book “Sexism in America: Alive, Well and Ruining Our Future,” said. “This is the click moment. It’s like, ‘Enough.’ And then there’s a snowball effect: Once you see women speaking truth to power and not being told, ‘This is just what you have to put up with,’ then it encourages other women to stand up.”

With Mr. Weinstein, the accusers were on the record, poised, and more of them seem to emerge each day, so no individual had to bear the burden alone, as Professor Hill had. “When you have Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow in the same sentence, well, people take note,” the sociologist Michael Kimmel said.

But behind these famous faces was an army of ordinary voices, too, using social media to collectively tell their stories — but also for action. In the case of Bill O’Reilly, remember, it was a coordinated effort, by groups that included the organizers of the Women’s March, that urged advertisers to #DropOReilly. They, and Fox News, ultimately did.

Another significant new element is the presence of what many have called silent co-conspirators: dozens of people, over dozens of years, who knew what was going on but did nothing.

“There is this web of enablers,” Professor Kimmel, who runs the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University, said. “Bob Weinstein doesn’t say to Harvey, ‘You better stop or I’ll kick you out of the company.’ Billy Bush does not say to Donald Trump, ‘That’s disgusting, not to mention illegal.’ In the sexual assault world we often talk about how we incorrectly interpret women’s silence as consent. Well, we also mistake men’s silence for assent.”

A Look Back

If this is a moment of historical social change, it is worth looking at what led us here.

It was two years after that Ms. magazine cover, in 1979, that Catharine A. MacKinnon published a groundbreaking legal argument: that sexual harassment was a form of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was based on a legal theory she had developed while in law school.

Photo

That legal argument was tested with Mechelle Vinson, one of a number of African-American women who were involved in early sexual harassment lawsuits — this one a bank teller who said she was repeatedly raped by her married boss. In 1986, her case, with Professor MacKinnon’s help, was part of a Supreme Court ruling that enshrined the harassment-as-discrimination theory into law.

Then came Professor Hill, whose televised testimony about Mr. Thomas, her former boss — at the E.E.O.C., of all places — was, Ms. Berg said, in effect “home-schooling a generation of Americans in what sexual harassment was.” Almost immediately, the phone hotline for 9to5, a support group for working women, began ringing off the hook.

“People were almost bewildered,” the group’s director told The New York Times in 1992. “You mean this is sexual harassment? You mean I could do something about this?”

Ms. Berg said she remembers a former colleague calling to ask, of their former boss, “Did he proposition you, too?” (He had.) Professor Kimmel said his mother told him over dinner that she was harassed in graduate school.

“It was literally water-cooler conversation everywhere,” said Freada Kapor Klein, who conducted one of the first surveys on sexual harassment in the 1970s.

But most of those stories were shared in private — in part because of what the world watched Professor Hill endure. Before an all-male Senate judiciary panel, she was accused of bringing “sleaze” into the nomination process, portrayed as suffering from delusional fantasies, and famously called, by the pundit David Brock, “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.”

“I remember the anger of that moment,” Teresa Younger, then a 22-year-old nanny and now president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, said. “Anita Hill was the example of a strong, accomplished black woman, and if she of all people could be discredited then it seemed women, particularly women of color, had no voice when it came to sexual harassment.”

From ‘I Believe’ to #metoo

It’s worth noting that the campaign slogan back then, on buttons and bumper stickers rather than Facebook and Twitter, was not “Me Too” but “I Believe Anita” — a message of solidarity, not self-exposure.

After Professor Hill came Ms. Jones, whose lawsuit against Mr. Clinton was dismissed. Others won in court but struggled in the aftermath: Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was sexually assaulted by drunken officers, was sidelined and ultimately quit her job. Rena Weeks, a law secretary who was harassed by a partner, never worked again.

“I think for a long time it shut women up, at least publicly,” Professor Kimmel said.

In her 2017 book, “Butterfly Politics,” Professor MacKinnon adapts a concept from chaos theory in which the tiny motion of a butterfly’s wings can trigger a tornado half a world away. Under the right conditions, she posits, small actions can produce major social transformations.

“Ashley Judd is the butterfly of this moment,” Professor MacKinnon said of the actor who began the recent groundswell of accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “She is the one who broke it open, who has made this possible for so many other women. And so you have an explosion of it because it’s for so long been suppressed.”

Professor Kimmel, the sociologist, said, “There comes a tipping point when the ‘frame’ changes.”

”One day, segregated water fountains seemed ‘normal’ if you were a white Southerner,” he noted. “It’s just how things were. Then they’re illegal, and a few years later you say, ‘Wow, how did we ever see that as O.K.?’”

Ms. Friedman, though, said she is waiting for an important moment: “When are we going to start believing people the first time?”

“When is it going to be that one instance is enough, and that you don’t have to find out 30 years later?” she asked. “I also worry that there is the possibility for this to be treated like a cancer, and now Harvey is gone so the cancer is excised. But Harvey is not the only cancer.”",The ‘Click’ Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/sexual-harrasment-weinstein-trump.html

FLINT, Mich. — Mayor Karen Weaver sailed into office two years ago promising to clean Flint’s lead-tainted water and to restore trust in government, after previous leaders brought poisoned water to the city and ignored residents when they complained. Ms. Weaver declared a state of emergency , met with the president and made the rounds on cable television, quickly becoming one of America’s most visible mayors.

But as her celebrity grew, so too did a revolt within her own City Hall. She now faces City Council members accusing her of corruption, a court battle over Flint’s long-term water source and, on Tuesday, a recall election that could snuff out her four-year term at the halfway point.

Ms. Weaver, who is black and the first woman to hold her post, blames racism, sexism and petty politics for the recall. She said the election has become a distraction from the urgent work of shoring up Flint’s shaky finances and re-establishing confidence in the drinking water.

“I think we’ve played a bad hand very well, very nicely,” Ms. Weaver said in an interview at her office, where a lobby television displays information about lead contamination. She added: “You wait for a woman to come and clean things up, and then here you come and want to take it.”

But Ms. Weaver’s opponents — 17 names will appear on the ballot along with hers — dismiss her as a political amateur who has run Flint like a fief, failed to engage with the City Council and further eroded the public’s already battered faith in government . The candidate who receives the most votes on Tuesday will serve out the remainder of the term.

“The mayor is trying to turn this into a racial campaign, and it has nothing to do with me being white and her being an African-American female,” said Scott Kincaid, a longtime city councilman and labor-union employee who is widely considered the main challenger in the recall. “It has to do with her inability to govern the City of Flint.”

It has been more than three years since a state-appointed emergency manager made a cost-saving switch in Flint’s drinking water source , which led to discoloration , lead poisoning and a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease . As the scope of the contamination was becoming clear, Ms. Weaver defeated the incumbent mayor in 2015 by staking her campaign on solving the water crisis and promising to bring in resources to help residents.

Life and politics remain upended here by the water. Many Flint residents, including Ms. Weaver, still use bottled water to drink and to brush their teeth, even though tests show the tap water is improving.

“We don’t trust,” said Ms. Weaver, a psychologist who had never before held elected office. “Something that’s difficult to re-establish is trust, when you’ve been lied to at every level of government.”

Ms. Weaver inherited a city that had struggled long before the water turned toxic . About half as many people live here now as when the auto industry was booming, and 41 percent of the 97,000 current residents live in poverty. Flint’s murder rate is consistently among the country’s worst.

Over the years, voters in this heavily Democratic city have blamed politicians for some of that decline, successfully recalling one mayor and attempting to oust others . Michigan governors have been criticized for sending in emergency managers to run Flint and take control away from local leaders elected by residents. In one sure sign of disgust with the entire political system, a pet pig named Giggles made national news here in 2015 as a write-in candidate for mayor, a mock campaign rooted in dissatisfaction with the human options.

Ms. Weaver’s opponents say she has further tainted the public’s perception of city government. Among their grievances: Her attempt to do business with a trash-collection company that has been accused of corruption elsewhere; the lack of working relationships with Council members; and a long-running dispute about where Flint should get its drinking water in the future and how much residents should pay .

“There’s been a constant, general incompetence,” said Kate Fields, a City Council member who is supporting Mr. Kincaid in the recall. Ms. Fields has accused the Weaver administration of corruption and complained to the state about her campaign practices.

Stirring intense debate, Flint police officers have knocked on the doors of people whose names appeared on recall petitions against Ms. Weaver to ask if they had in fact signed the document. The county clerk, John Gleason, who certified the petitions, called that “voter intimidation and harassment.”

Ms. Weaver denied any wrongdoing and said the criticisms were politically motivated. Far from intimidating voters, Ms. Weaver said, the police were investigating allegations that people had been duped into signing recall petitions.

“I guess if the police are investigating you, they’re going to show up at your house, at your job,” said Ms. Weaver, who filed and later dropped a lawsuit challenging the validity of the recall . “They were just doing their job.”

Ms. Weaver said her two years in office have been marked by progress in the midst of crisis. She points to state and federal disaster assistance funding, a fire station that reopened, new businesses downtown and a city-led effort to replace tainted pipes. So far, more than 5,200 houses have had pipes replaced.

Eric Mays, the mayor’s only consistent ally on the City Council, said Ms. Weaver has done well and that some of her opposition seems rooted in jealousy about her national fame. “Everybody is trying to be in the news, and they’ve kind of lost focus,” he said.

Others see it differently. At a forum last month at the Flint Public Library, a parade of mayoral hopefuls blasted Ms. Weaver’s policies; her collaboration with Rick Snyder, the Republican governor of Michigan; and her handling of the water crisis. “Mayor Weaver won’t be for the people,” said one candidate, Arthur Woodson , who accused of her corruption and of using the water crisis for political gain.

City Council members supporting Mr. Kincaid accused Ms. Weaver of injecting race into the campaign in a city where about 55 percent of residents are African-American and where votes have long been cast along racial lines. Though their posts are officially nonpartisan, Ms. Weaver and the City Council members are Democrats.

“I don’t like the fact that they came in playing the race-card game,” said Wantwaz Davis, a City Council member who is black and who signed the recall petition. “It’s not about blacks against whites.”

Mr. Gleason, the county clerk, said he was afraid that the recall had only exacerbated a long-festering sense in Flint that the political system is broken, that elections do not matter and that votes do not count. He predicted “a very dismal turnout” on Tuesday, perhaps around 13 percent of eligible voters.

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.
“I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.
The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.
For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.","“We don’t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn’t pay for an internship,” said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.

There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago’s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary — at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can’t afford to pay — 40 percent can’t — the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.

Starting last year, the university’s Odyssey Scholars — low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg — have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital — like parental connections — needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated.

Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.

“We’re not trying to proselytize with these students, but we’d like their eyes to be open to the second and third sectors in our economy,” said Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace’s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The center pairs students with nonprofits in and around New York City, like Greyston Bakery, Housing Works and the Legal Aid Society. Elizabeth Pooran interned last year at Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, a community space designed to teach technology, including digital photography and the internet, to older adults to encourage them to lead independent, connected lives. And Latino U College Access, a fledgling nonprofit that works with first-generation college students, has used Pace interns for three of its five years. “I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.

Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.

Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia’s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part.

“This is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,” said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. “Especially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.”

Amherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.

Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst’s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.

Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.

It’s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.

Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.

“We do allow students to do a self-designed summer,” he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.

Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between “an immersive experience” and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry.

China plans to return the favor when Mr. Trump arrives Wednesday for what the Chinese Foreign Ministry says is his first visit to Beijing. The Chinese are calling it “a state visit-plus,” promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City.

The welcome is designed to make Mr. Trump feel important, reflecting the belief of at least some Chinese officials that they know just how to handle an outspoken tycoon with a big ego.

But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his “China Dream” — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world.

Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a “new type of great power relations,” the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.

The concept is closely associated with Mr. Xi, who has been pitching it since he was vice president. But the Obama administration viewed it as code for allowing China to establish a sphere of influence in Asia, with the United States withdrawing to minimize conflict.

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told state news media last week he hoped Mr. Trump’s visit would revive the idea and allow the two nations to build a “constructive partnership.” The vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, said the two leaders would discuss a “blueprint” for developing relations.

Chinese analysts believe the timing works to Mr. Xi’s advantage. Mr. Trump will be arriving as he faces new questions about the Russia investigation at home and criticism abroad for appearing to abandon American leadership on issues from climate change to trade liberalization.

In contrast, Mr. Xi has been basking in the aftermath of a party congress last month that elevated him to the same status as the nation’s founding father, Mao Zedong.

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Xi has positioned China as a stable alternative to the United States, willing to take on the obligations of global leadership and invest in big infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe much as the United States did after World War II.

“China, for the first time, is not in a humble position regarding the United States,” said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Usually the American president has the advantage. This is the first time there is an equal relationship between the two leaders.”

Mr. Xi is now the unquestioned paramount leader of China, Professor Yan added, while Mr. Trump only “represents himself.”

Asked on Sunday about the disparity, Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States. “We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Xi may also be counting on personal chemistry between the two men. They appeared to bond when they first met at Mr. Trump’s Florida estate in April, and Mr. Trump has since called Mr. Xi numerous times, often to ask him to get tougher on North Korea.

In interviews, Mr. Trump has frequently praised Mr. Xi and described him as a friend, often in effusive terms unusual for an American president speaking of the leader of China’s authoritarian, one-party state. At times, Mr. Trump has even repeated points made by Mr. Xi in their conversations.

Still, Chinese officials, known for their attention to detail and protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries, appear to be somewhat on edge over what Mr. Trump might say, and how he might say it, during the visit.

Twitter is blocked in China, but it is generally accessible on foreign cellphones. “How President Trump communicates with the outside — this is not something you need to worry about,” said Mr. Zheng, the vice minister, when asked if the American president would be able to use his favorite social media platform.

Beijing’s anxieties about the visit are due at least in part to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s view of China.

Mr. Trump’s call to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific” emphasizing Australia, India and Japan echoes the view of the national security establishment in Washington that China’s growing clout in Asia must be managed or even contained.

But Mr. Trump has also embraced those who say the United States must take a much tougher position on trade with China, including Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. They say that Beijing is exploiting America’s openness while keeping its own markets closed, and Washington must insist on reciprocity even at the risk of a trade war.

This clashes with a third view in the administration, often associated with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that considers China an inseparable economic partner and business opportunity for the United States.

Mr. Kushner served as go-between in arranging the president’s first meeting with Mr. Xi but has taken a lower profile since then, in part, officials have said, because of concerns about his efforts to bring Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures.

John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, tilted the White House away from criticism of Beijing in an interview on Fox News last week, saying China had beaten the United States on trade but “that doesn’t make them an enemy.”

He also said that China has “a system of government that has apparently worked for the Chinese people.”

The remarks drew heckles from many in Washington who cited China’s human rights record but praise from the Chinese news media as reflecting the more equal relationship that Mr. Xi seeks.

Mr. Trump’s top concern is expected to be North Korea and its nuclear arsenal, and many analysts believe Mr. Xi will use the potential for greater Chinese pressure on North Korea to draw Mr. Trump closer to embracing a “great power” relationship.

“As Trump needs Xi’s help with the North Korean challenge and as he is not a traditional realist, he may agree, to the chagrin of his advisers,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.

Accepting China as a partner has been a fraught proposition for Mr. Trump’s predecessors. When former President Bill Clinton agreed to work toward “ a constructive strategic partnership in the 21st century,” he was criticized for cozying up to China just a few years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Two decades later, human rights in China remains a potential point of friction, with some in the administration lobbying Mr. Trump to press Mr. Xi on the fate of Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in July after eight years in prison.

Like the Obama administration in its latter years, though, Mr. Trump has not made a priority of such issues, even as Mr. Xi has conducted a sweeping crackdown on civil society.

“The word ‘partnership’ has a long and sad history in the vocabulary of U.S.-China relations,” Professor Lampton said. “American politicians since have avoided the word partnership.”","Wooing Trump, Xi Jinping Seeks Great Power Status for China",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/asia/trump-xi-jinping-visit-china.html

She saw: “Children in proper school uniforms carrying shoes, trying to decide between the lure of a coco palm adventure to one side and the delicious morning sea on the other.”

I, too, saw children, dozens of them on either side of the street one morning. Most of the children wore traditional uniforms, white shirts and blouses and plaid skirts or dark or khaki shorts or pants. They huddled together chatting and giggling, not paying attention to the dark blue sea on one side or the colorfully painted houses and buildings in the hills on the other. These children reminded me of children you would see heading to school in my native Haiti, or most other Caribbean islands, their range of black and brown skin glistening in the sun. The older ones kept their younger siblings at their side, even as they climbed into public transportation minivans and buses.

I went in search of more of those “vivid images” in Lorde’s essay and, besides the school children at Grand Anse Beach, there was Fat Woman-Who-Fries-Fish-In-The-Market. I did not see her inside the turquoise-and-white square building downtown. She was not standing near the massive fish laid out on slabs waiting to be gutted. Nor was she by the smaller ones piled into buckets out front.

The fish market smelled predictably like the sea. The buzz of the customer and buyer exchanges was a lot more subdued than I expected. Not all the vendors had customers. The market’s relative calm on a Friday afternoon reminded me how small Grenada is. The island is 120 square miles and has about 100,000 residents.

That night while pondering all this in my hotel room at the Coyaba Beach Resort, I parted the curtains and looked for a full moon to turn the beach outside “flash green.” October is perhaps the wrong time of year for this. Lorde had seen the sand turn green in April. There was no full moon, but I slept with the sliding door to the terrace open so I could hear the waves gently grazing the shore.

I AM NOT A GOOD TOURIST. I can easily evoke for myself the worse case scenario in any type of travel situation. I have immigrant guilt about taking time off. I am a bad swimmer. I am self-conscious in bathing suits, so most of my tourism is done through books. But because of my writing, I am invited to quite a few places and whenever I can I go.

I was in Grenada, which was largely unaffected by the hurricanes, to receive an honorary degree from the University of the West Indies Open Campus. Unlike U.W.I.’s brick and mortar campuses, the Open Campus is a virtual one. The 657 students in my graduating class hailed from all over the English-speaking Caribbean. They earned their degrees online. Only 139 graduates would cross the stage though.

Not all the graduates always travel to the Open Campus ceremonies, my hosts from the University of the West Indies told me. However, this year there were students who wanted to come to their graduation in Grenada but could not. Most of the graduates travel from other countries for the Open Campus ceremony, which takes place in a different location each year. Many had homes that were damaged or destroyed. Some lost loved ones along with everything they owned.

I was told the story of one graduate from Trinidad who stayed home because she had donated her plane ticket money to relief efforts in Dominica, which has U.W.I.’s most devastated campus. Some of the students from that campus are still unaccounted for.

Hurricane Maria struck Dominica, the southernmost of the Leeward Islands as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 18. Dominica’s Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, whose own roof collapsed during the storm, later told CNN: “Our agriculture sector is 100 percent destroyed. Our tourism is, I would say, about 95 percent destroyed.”

In front of the supermarket across from the Coyaba Beach Resort were blue barrels lined up to collect food and other urgently needed supplies for Dominica. At The Beach House Restaurant, just north of the airport, where I attended a pre-graduation cocktail party the night before the ceremony, the young female singer entertaining us with classic soul, as well as Caribbean covers, reminded everyone to drop something in the basket that would usually hold her tips. This time the funds would go to Dominica.

I have never been to Dominica but now I wish I had. This is not just born out of a desire to see a place “before.” Before the devastation, before the storm. I am from a place, Haiti, that constantly evokes nostalgia in the people who have seen it, lived in it, and loved it “before.”

DOMINICA GRENADA Trinidad and Tobago GRENADA Gouyave Caribbean Sea Grenville Grand Etang National Park St. George’s Grand Anse Beach Coyaba Beach Resort The Beach House Restaurant St. George’s University Maurice Bishop International Airport 4 miles

This longing for before always saddens me because it makes the present seem even worse. But I still wish I had seen Dominica before, in part because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite novelists, Jean Rhys. The places that Antoinette, Rhys’ doomed narrator in “Wide Sargasso Sea,” longs for have flaming sunsets and rivers so clear that you can see the pebbles at the bottom. They have moss-covered gardens filled with orchids, hibiscus and flamboyants, which are illuminated at night by fireflies.

This is one of the ways I have imagined Dominica, along with what I have seen in travel guides: its high mountain peaks, forts, lush rain forests, reefs, gorges, lakes and water falls.

Dominica is also home to Xuela Claudette Richardson, the narrator of Jamaica Kincaid’s novel “The Autobiography of My Mother.” At 15, Xuela was taken by her father to Roseau, the capital of Dominica. Roseau, Xuela finds — like a lot of places in the Caribbean — “had a fragile foundation, and from time to time was destroyed by forces of nature, a hurricane or water coming from the sky as if suddenly the sea were above and the heavens below.”

“THE SECOND TIME I came to Grenada,” Audre Lorde wrote in “Grenada Revisited,” “I came in mourning and fear that this land which I was learning had been savaged, invaded, its people maneuvered into saying thank you to their invaders.”

Lorde’s second visit was in late 1983, after then U.S. president Ronald Reagan had deployed Marines to the island. Reagan declared that he wanted to prevent a “Soviet-Cuban” colony from taking root in Grenada and protect American citizens on the island, many of whom were students at St. George’s University School of Medicine.

I visited St. George’s University, whose students and officials, Lorde pointed out, later denied that they were ever in danger. The school, which is no longer just a medical school, but also covers other disciplines, is an island unto itself, with its many salmon-colored buildings, massive water tanks, security personnel and buses. All over the campus are breathtaking views of True Blue Bay, the point where the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet.

If Reagan was so interested in seeing democracy flourish in the Caribbean, Lorde wondered, why did the U.S. government support Haiti’s Jean-Claude Duvalier and his repressive regime? She also mentioned Puerto Rico.

In 1897, she wrote, “U.S. Marines landed in Puerto Rico to fight the Spanish-American War. They never left.”

Puerto Rico was as devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria as Dominica, Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I have not been to Puerto Rico either. I have only visited it in books, particularly through the eyes of young Esmeralda Santiago in her memoir, “When I Was Puerto Rican.”

I imagined the guavas that she taught me and other readers to eat at the beginning of her book being no longer able to grow, the fields they came from deep in the countryside flattened, and the families that farmed them struggling to stay alive without food or clean water.

I watched an interview with the tireless mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto, and heard echoes of Audre Lorde in her voice.

“There is nothing that unites people more anywhere in the world than injustice,” the mayor said. “We have to get food, we have to get water or else we are being condemned to a slow death. It may be easy to try to disregard us. It may be easy because we are a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we’re a people, damn it.”

The blessings of our islands are also our curse. Our geography gives us year-round sun and beautiful beaches, but more and more in the age of climate change, we are on the front line of destruction.

“We are a people” seems to be what we have been saying for generations to all our colonizers and invaders who seemed intent on destroying us. And now more than ever, Mother Nature, too.

We are a people, the Arawaks and Taínos might have said, even as they died trying to prove it. We have even inherited the word for hurricane, huracán, from them.

“Much has been terribly lost in Grenada,” Lorde wrote at the end of her 1983 visit, “but not all — not the spirit of the people.”

THE SPIRIT of the people is also captured in this poem I have been carrying with me for years before coming to Grenada. It was written by the Grenadian poet and short story writer Merle Collins.

“We speak,” she wrote in “Because the Dawn Breaks,” “for the same reason that the thunder frightens the child

that the lightning startles the tree …”

The people of the Caribbean speak, the poet wrote, because we “were not born

to be your vassals.”

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website.

Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache, a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Photo

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

•

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

“This is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,” said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.","The arrests came at an awkward time for the kingdom.

Prince Mohammed recently invited more than 3,500 investors, corporate chief executives, and leaders of nongovernmental organizations to Riyadh for a three-day conference intended to promote future business opportunities. Officials promised that the public offering of the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, would go forward and that the sovereign wealth fund would soon rank among the richest in the world with more than $400 billion in assets by 2020. They pledged to build a utopian megacity on a stretch of deserted land that would attract capital and talent from all over the world.

The conference attracted a slew of senior executives and officials, including Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain; Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of the Japanese technology company SoftBank; and Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman. Some of the attendees spoke highly of Crown Prince Mohammed’s economic ambitions. The planned initial public offering of Aramco, they noted, could free government capital to spend on urban investment and job development. Cultural changes like granting women the right to drive could encourage Western companies to invest in or start operations in Saudi Arabia.

Despite the goodwill, few had backed the effort with time and money. And the weekend’s arrests could add to that reluctance. But they could also change some perceptions, if the crown prince can eventually show a broader commitment to shaking up an entrenched royal bureaucracy.

“I think this is going to slow things down, but if the gambit is successful it will help,” said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas company now attempting to make energy deals with Saudi Arabia. Speaking of Crown Crown Prince Mohammed, he said, “Once he has consolidated power, he will do what he wants to do, which is to modernize the country and modernize Islam, which are all good things. But it might be very dangerous and it might not work.”

Even before the arrests, investors didn’t quite know what to make of the kingdom.

Saudi Arabia has unveiled a sweeping economic reconstruction called Vision 2030, intended to diversify the country’s employment beyond oil. The cornerstone of the economic effort is the proposed initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, which exchanges around the world have been vying to secure. In a tweet just hours before the arrests, President Trump said he would appreciate it if the Saudi Aramco public offering took place on the New York Stock Exchange.

The crown prince and his father, King Salman, have also won praise from local and international business leaders for their promises to return the kingdom to the kind of religious moderation that was more prevalent before a period of religious and sectarian unrest in 1979, when the royal family began to rely on conservative Islamic clerics to guarantee stability. They have had the temerity to take on the religious police and begin rolling back some social policies.

But Saudi Arabia has also faced unusual turbulence, complete with the sacking of two crown princes, a costly war in Yemen and a confrontation with Qatar. The weak price of oil has amplified the financial stress in the kingdom. The government has been forced to cut benefits for highly paid civil servants.

There remains a great deal of skepticism that the economic re-engineering can be pulled off, in part because much of the royal family and old guard have been made rich from payments by Saudi Aramco, whose books are essentially closed to the public. That is one reason there is growing talk that the Saudis will eventually turn to China, rather than the London or New York stock exchanges, to get around Western regulators and raise capital for Saudi Aramco.

“I don’t see them get investor interest unless they can produce a set of financial books that have been audited to Western accounting standards,” said Nancy T. Schmitt, president of Taum Sauk Investments, a firm based in New York that specializes in energy. “If this is a step to getting to that, then this is a good thing. But I don’t know that because I can’t read the palace intrigue.”

The arrests just make it harder to sort through the business climate.

Some interpreted the arrests as being disturbingly arbitrary. One of the officials arrested was the former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco board member. Another was Adel Fakieh, an early drafter of the crown prince’s reforms, who was ousted from his post of economy minister earlier Saturday.

“I don’t think it sends a particularly good signal to investors,” said Rachel Ziemba, managing director for emerging markets at Roubini Global Economics, a research firm in New York.

There is another school of thought among business leaders and analysts that the arrests were part of an effort to make the Saudi Aramco offering and other reforms unstoppable. In that way, it would be the sort of proof that the crown prince has the power to get his agenda done.

“This is just the kind of determination and commitment that is called for,” said Sadad al-Husseini, former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco.

Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. “Does this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?” she asked. “It’s a high-stakes game.”",Investors Worldwide Size Up Palace Intrigue in Oil-Rich Kingdom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/business/saudi-arabia-arrests-investors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — The moments following a horrific mass shooting that left 26 people dead at a Sunday church service in this rural Texas town came into clearer view on Monday morning, as the county sheriff detailed a firefight and car chase that ended with the gunman dead after a crash.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said that he believes that the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went around the outside of the church firing rounds before entering and shooting at parishioners. After Mr. Kelley exited the church, he and an armed bystander engaged in a brief “fire fight” before the suspect went into his vehicle, according to the sheriff. The gunman had dropped his rifle in the church after slaughtering the parishioners; he pulled a pistol during his exchange with the bystander.

The bystander — who Sheriff Tackitt said is a “hero” but declined to give his name — then waved down a man in a vehicle and the two began pursuing the gunman, Sheriff Tackitt said in an interview with CBS, and may have engaged in a firefight along the way before the gunman’s vehicle crashed into a fence.

Mr. Kelley, 26, was found to have a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but it is unclear if the wound was fatal or if he died from other injuries. The sheriff said that he did not yet know what the motive could have been, but he said that the shooter’s in-laws live in a nearby town and had previously attended the church on several occasions.

The in-laws and Mr. Kelley’s ex-wife were interviewed by investigators last night in Sutherland Springs. They were not in the town at the time of the shooting according to law enforcement. Sheriff Tackitt said one of the most horrific aspects of the mass killing were the number of children who had been shot. He did not give a definite number.

Mr. Kelley was clad in all black, with a ballistic vest strapped to his chest and a military-style rifle in his hands, when he opened fire on parishioners, turning this tiny town east of San Antonio into the scene of the country’s newest mass horror.

He had served in the Air Force at a base in New Mexico but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

The motive for the attack was unclear on Sunday, but the grisly nature of it could not have been clearer: Families gathered in pews, clutching Bibles and praying to the Lord, were murdered in cold blood on the spot.

Mr. Kelley started firing at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs not long after the Sunday morning service began at 11 a.m., officials said. He was armed with a Ruger military-style rifle, and within minutes, many of those inside the small church were either dead or wounded. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, and among the dead were several children, a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. At least 20 more were wounded.

“It’s something we all say does not happen in small communities, although we found out today it does,” said Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs.

Sheriff Tackitt and other officials said the gunman first stopped at a gas station across Highway 87 from the church. He drove across the street, got out of his car and began firing from the outside, moving to the right side of the church, the authorities said. Then he entered the building and kept firing.

The authorities received their first call about a gunman at about 11:20 a.m. Officials and witnesses said Mr. Kelley appeared to be prepared for an assault, with black tactical gear, multiple rounds of ammunition and a ballistic vest.

“He went there, he walked in, started shooting people and then took off,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas congressman who represents the region and who was briefed by law enforcement officials.

When Mr. Kelley emerged from the church, an armed neighbor exchanged gunfire with him, hitting Mr. Kelley, who fled in his vehicle. Neighbors apparently followed him, chasing him into the next county, Guadalupe County, where Mr. Kelley crashed his car. Mr. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle. Officials said it was unclear how Mr. Kelley had died.

At the church, he left behind a scene of carnage. Of the 26 fatalities, 23 people were found dead inside the church, two were found outside, and one died later at a hospital.

Speaking at a news conference in Japan, the first stop on his tour of Asia, President Trump called the shooting a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation,” adding the gunman was a “very deranged individual.” He also ordered flags flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal buildings through Thursday.

In Floresville, Tex., hours after the attack, Scott Holcombe, 30, sat with his sister on the curb outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center. They were both in tears. Their father, Bryan Holcombe, had been guest preaching at the church, they said, and he and their mother, Karla Holcombe, were killed.

“I’m dumbfounded,” Mr. Holcombe said, also noting that his pregnant sister-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, had been killed. “This is unimaginable. My father was a good man, and he loved to preach. He had a good heart.”

His sister, Sarah Slavin, 33, added: “They weren’t afraid of death. They had a strong faith, so there’s comfort in that. I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn’t scared.”

A parishioner, Sandy Ward, said that a daughter-in-law and three of her grandchildren were shot. Her grandson, who is 5, was shot four times and remained in surgery Sunday night. She said she was awaiting word on her other family members.

Ms. Ward said she did not attend services on Sunday because of her troubled knees and a bad hip. “I just started praying for everybody who was there” when she learned of the shooting, she said.

At a news conference on Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott said that he and other Texans were asking “for God’s comfort, for God’s guidance and for God’s healing for all those who are suffering.”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping in the investigation, which was being led by the Texas Rangers.

The shooting unfolded on the eighth anniversary of the attack in 2009 on Fort Hood in Texas, when an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, killed 13 people in one of the deadliest mass shootings at an American military base. Major Hasan carried out his attack in an attempt to wage jihad on American military personnel.

The death toll on Sunday also exceeded the number killed in 1966 by a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Charles Whitman, who opened fire from the school’s clock tower in a day of violence that ultimately killed 17. It also exceeded the number killed during a rampage at a restaurant in Killeen in 1991 in which a gunman fatally shot 23 people and then took his own life.

And the shooting on Sunday occurred more than two years after Dylann S. Roof opened fire at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015, killing nine people, including the pastor. The motive in that attack was racial hatred — Mr. Roof, a white supremacist, plotted an assault on a black congregation — but no motive has been established by the authorities in the shooting in Sutherland Springs. The First Baptist Church is predominantly white, and Mr. Kelley is white.

The authorities said Mr. Kelley used an Ruger AR-15 variant — a knockoff of the standard service rifle carried by the American military for roughly half a century.

Almost all AR-15 variants legally sold in the United States fire only semiautomatically, and they were covered by the federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994. Since the ban expired in 2004, the weapons have been legal to sell or possess in much of the United States, and sales of AR-15s have surged.

Ruger’s AR-15s made for civilian markets sell for about $500 to $900, depending on the model.

Mr. Kelley grew up in New Braunfels, in his parents’ nearly $1 million home, and was married in 2014. He had been married at least once before and was sued for divorce in 2012 in New Mexico, the same year he was court-martialed on charges of assaulting his wife and child.

Why he chose to attack a church 30 miles away from his home is one of the questions that remained unanswered.

Sutherland Springs in Wilson County is about 34 miles east of downtown San Antonio, in a slow-paced region where church-going is a common part of the Sunday routine. The church marquee on Sunday needed updating from last week, reading, “Join Us, Fall Fest, Oct 31, 6 to 8 PM.”

The unincorporated community has a population that numbers in the low hundreds — the 2000 census was 362, according to the Texas State Historical Association. The preliminary death toll would amount to about 7 percent of that population.

On Sunday night, a few minutes down a pitch-black road, victims’ families gathered at another house of worship, the River Oaks Church. Its parking lot was full of about 50 large trucks, and parents walked into the building holding their children’s hands.

The police kept tight control over the scene, refusing to allow any reporters to enter. One man in a cowboy hat was also turned away. “They said they’re gathering to inform the families, but they’ll only let immediate family in, only if you have a wristband,” he said. A short while later, a young man rushed out to his truck, visibly upset, and raced away.

The First Baptist Church, the scene of the shooting, was also sealed off, with yellow police-line tape posted around the church grounds.

First Baptist is a little church, albeit a tech-savvy one. The service at the church last Sunday was posted on YouTube, one of several posted there. Videos posted online show lyrics to the hymns appearing on television screens with parishioners playing electric guitars and a sign language interpreter translating the songs.

The video of last Sunday’s service begins with a rendition of a song called “Happiness Is the Lord.” Then the pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told his parishioners — 20 to 30 were visible in the video — to walk around the room and “shake somebody’s hand.”

“Tell them it’s good to see them in God’s house this morning,” Pastor Pomeroy said.","In Texas Shooting, Gunman Kills at Least 26",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

What We Don’t Know

• The authorities have not yet released the names of the gunman’s victims, though some names have come to light.

• His motive for the shooting is not yet clear.

• We still do not know how the gunman obtained the firearm he used in the attack.",Texas Church Killings: What We Know and Don’t Know,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/texas-church-killings-what-we-know.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.
“I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.
The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.
For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.","“We don’t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn’t pay for an internship,” said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.

There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago’s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary — at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can’t afford to pay — 40 percent can’t — the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.

Starting last year, the university’s Odyssey Scholars — low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg — have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital — like parental connections — needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated.

Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.

“We’re not trying to proselytize with these students, but we’d like their eyes to be open to the second and third sectors in our economy,” said Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace’s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The center pairs students with nonprofits in and around New York City, like Greyston Bakery, Housing Works and the Legal Aid Society. Elizabeth Pooran interned last year at Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, a community space designed to teach technology, including digital photography and the internet, to older adults to encourage them to lead independent, connected lives. And Latino U College Access, a fledgling nonprofit that works with first-generation college students, has used Pace interns for three of its five years. “I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.

Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.

Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia’s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part.

“This is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,” said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. “Especially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.”

Amherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.

Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst’s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.

Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.

It’s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.

Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.

“We do allow students to do a self-designed summer,” he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.

Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between “an immersive experience” and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry. That’s why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring.

“Our overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences,” he said, “without the limitation of financial barriers.”","When Internships Don’t Pay, Some Colleges Will",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/education/edlife/paid-internships-colleges-social-service.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s constructor, Natan Last, has taken the road less traveled, at least in his career. After being graduated from Brown University in 2012, he worked in economic consulting at a start-up company in Kenya and at an education nonprofit before landing a job as a strategist at the International Rescue Committee. He has devoted his life thus far to being of service, and I say kudos to him.

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.” — Robert Frost

Mr. Last’s puzzle not only uses the title of Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “THE ROAD NOT TAKEN” as a seed entry, but he shows us how to (almost) effortlessly make that detour when necessary.

Today’s Theme

Five phrases take a masterful detour as we make our way from left to right in today’s puzzle. One of things I liked about today’s theme is that the entire puzzle is solvable even if you don’t take those detours.

For example, Mr. Last’s seed entry, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is clued as “1916 Frost verse … or, diverged: Start of a saying about meaning well.” It’s a central Across entry, but once you get to the “N” in NOT, the road diverges into shaded/circled squares and becomes THE ROAD TO HELL. That’s the start to the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

Just before the fall of the czar, Lenin reflected to his wife that revolution “won’t happen in our lifetime.” Ultimately, it was a spontaneous, disorganized popular uprising and a crisis of military loyalty that forced Nicholas’s abdication. When that moment arrived, Lenin was in Zurich, Trotsky in New York and Stalin in Siberia.

Lenin initially thought it was “a hoax.” He was lucky that Germany inserted him like a bacillus (via the so-called sealed train) to take Russia out of the war. Back in Petrograd, Lenin, aided by fellow-radicals Trotsky and Stalin, had to overpower erring Bolshevik comrades, who proposed cooperation with the provisional government, and force them to agree to his plan for a coup. The government should have found and killed him but it failed to do so. He succeeded.

Even the “storming” of the Winter Palace — restaged in a 1920 propaganda spectacular as a people’s triumph — was no storming at all. Lenin rages as it took days to seize the main buildings of the government, while the palace itself was taken by climbing through unlocked windows, undefended except for adolescent cadets — followed by a bacchanalia, with drunk Bolsheviks slurping the czar’s Château d’Yquem 1847 out of the gutters.

October might have heralded a short-lived interim, like so many other failed revolutions of that era. Any coordinated attack by White armies, the other side in the Russian civil war, or any intervention by Western forces would have swept the Bolsheviks away. It all depended on Lenin. He was very nearly overthrown in a coup by rebellious coalition partners but he made his own luck, though, by a combination of ideological passion, ruthless pragmatism, unchecked bloodletting and the will to establish a dictatorship. And sometimes, he just got plain lucky: On Aug. 30, 1918, he was shot while addressing a crowd of workers at a factory in Moscow. He survived by inches.

Had any of these events foiled Lenin, our own times would be radically different. Without Lenin there would have been no Hitler. Hitler owed much of his rise to the support of conservative elites who feared a Bolshevik revolution on German soil and who believed that he alone could defeat Marxism. And the rest of his radical program was likewise justified by the threat of Leninist revolution. His anti-Semitism, his anti-Slavic plan for Lebensraum and above all the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 were supported by the elites and the people because of the fear of what the Nazis called “Judeo-Bolshevism.”

Without the Russian Revolution of 1917, Hitler would likely have ended up painting postcards in one of the same flophouses where he started. No Lenin, no Hitler — and the 20th century becomes unimaginable. Indeed, the very geography of our imagination becomes unimaginable.

The East would look as different as the West. Mao, who received huge amounts of Soviet aid in the 1940s, would not have conquered China, which might still be ruled by the family of Chiang Kai-shek. The inspirations that illuminated the mountains of Cuba and the jungles of Vietnam would never have been. Kim Jong-un, pantomimic pastiche of Stalin, would not exist. There would have been no Cold War. The tournaments of power would likely have been just as vicious — just differently vicious.

The Russian Revolution mobilized a popular passion across the world based on Marxism-Leninism, fueled by messianic zeal. It was, perhaps, after the three Abrahamic religions, the greatest millenarian rapture of human history.

That virtuous idealism justified any monstrosity. The Bolsheviks admired the cleansing purges of Robespierre’s Reign of Terror: “A revolution without firing squads is meaningless,” Lenin said. The Bolsheviks created the first professional revolutionaries, the first total police state, the first modern mass-mobilization on behalf of class war against counterrevolution. Bolshevism was a mind-set, an idiosyncratic culture with an intolerant paranoid wordview obsessed with abstruse Marxist ideology. Their zeal justified the mass killings of all enemies, real and potential, not just by Lenin or Stalin but also Mao, Pol Pot in Cambodia, Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia. It also gave birth to slave labor camps, economic catastrophe and untold psychological damage. (These events are now so long ago that the horrors have been blurred and history forgotten; a glamorous glow of power and idealism lingers to intoxicate young voters disenchanted with the bland dithering of liberal capitalism.)

And then there is Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union. President Vladimir Putin’s power is enforced by his fellow former K.G.B. officers, the heirs of Lenin and Stalin’s secret police. Mr. Putin and his regime have adopted the Leninist tactics of “konspiratsia” and “dezinformatsiya,” which have turned out to be ideally suited to today’s technologies. Americans may have invented the internet, but they saw it (decadently) as a means of making money or (naïvely) as a magical click to freedom. The Russians, bred on Leninist cynicism, harnessed it to undermine American democracy.

Mr. Putin mourned the fall of Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, yet he regards Lenin as an agent of chaos between two epochs of national grandeur — the Romanovs before Nicholas II (Peter the Great and Alexander III are favorites) and Soviet Union’s superpower glory under Stalin.

Mr. Putin presents himself as a czar — and like any czar, he fears revolution above all else. That is why it is victory against Germany in 1945, not the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 that is the founding myth of Putinist Russia. Hence the irony that while the West has been discussing the revolution at length, Russia is largely pretending it never happened.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — This is a perfect puzzle for a Friday. It’s a puzzle by Kameron Austin Collins and Brendan Emmett Quigley and, if I can make a recommendation, it is best done curled up on the couch with a fine beverage, and the knowledge that the weekend is at hand. Maybe there’s some music playing in the background, and some good chocolate nearby. All I know is that I smiled all the way through this puzzle, and I hope you did, too.

The reason I smiled is because this was the most satisfying tug-of-war I’ve been a part of in a long time. I didn’t know all the answers. Well, my brain did, mostly, but the answers weren’t always at the surface. I had to dig for some of them, and work the grid for others.

Meaty, lively entries (I was actually surprised that there were only two debuts today), and a mostly clean grid. Sneaky clues that are just out of reach, but which fall upon second look.

22A: The trick to a clue like “You, overseas” is to know that it is asking you for the word “You” in a foreign language (hence the clue word “overseas”). Got that? Good. Now your job is to figure out which language. There are a lot to choose from. TOI, for example, means “you” in French, but that’s not the answer. Now, if you know about the lean and hungry CASSIUS, who went on to be one of the recipients of Julius Caesar’s famous “Et tu”’s, you can fill that in, and that gives you the S. The only language I know that has a word meaning “you” that begins with an S is German, and the word is SIE.

WASHINGTON — Senator Rand Paul suffered five broken ribs and bruises to his lungs in an altercation with a neighbor on Friday at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., one of the senator’s advisers said on Sunday. The injuries, which the adviser said left Mr. Paul in considerable pain, appear to be much worse than the “minor” injuries that the police had reported on Saturday.

The Kentucky State Police arrested the neighbor, Rene Boucher, 59, and took him to the Warren County Regional Jail, where he was released on $7,500 bond.

Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections.","For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

View all New York Times newsletters.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

Like Rachel, he reads lips. Communicating on the phone with a deaf person is often not ideal, so we used video chat or email to correspond and give creative notes. I went to London to work with James and his colleagues for a few days, and interacting in person helped our process — but I could say that about any collaboration.

“When I work with voice-over, I’m hardly ever able to work out what’s being said from the voice track alone,” James explained. “I can hear when something is being said, but not so much what is being said. So I use a combination of the audio track and the transcript with time stamps. The audio waveform, which I can see on the computer screen, helps me to sync things up. If I still can’t work it out, there’s usually a friendly producer nearby who can help me fill in the gaps.”

At one point, before we had a crucial sound cue built in, James threw in some sound cues himself, but the volume levels were really loud so he could hear them. When we watched and listened to that version together, the hearing collaborators dove for the volume. We all laughed about it and James apologized, but it taught us a lesson: James’s sound cues were the only ones we felt as well as heard. That mattered for our sound design. In the moment when Rachel’s cochlear implants are turned on, we aimed to have a sound cue that jolted us physically.

We also wanted an acoustically extraordinary setting. Since there is a detail in Rachel’s op-ed about her first experiences hearing live music after getting her implant, we asked her where those experiences happened and which ones were the most impactful. The Santa Fe Opera, near her home in New Mexico, was at the top of her list. It generously opened its doors, and the back wall of its open-air stage, so we could film Rachel there with a twilit desert backdrop.

While the animations were being developed, we landed a partnership with the technical wizards at Lytro to create our live-action scenes. Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image. The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball. Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.

During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.

When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel’s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved. In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.

Because it has the priciest real estate markets in the country, state taxpayers get a huge benefit from writing off their mortgage debt. According to Zillow, there are only four metropolitan areas in the United States where more than half of homes are priced above $500,000: San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles/Orange County and San Diego.

To be clear, this is still just a plan. There are lots of negotiations to come, and the powerful real estate lobby has already suggested it will fight to retain the mortgage interest deduction, which has been widely decried as wasteful and unfair despite its benefits to homeowners.

Still, people generally like tax breaks. And two of California’s favorites are at risk.

Billions of bees are transported to California each year to pollinate almond groves, before moving on to prunes or plums, then cherries, and finally dispersing to crops like melons and blueberries.

But they don’t fly there.

One such highway shipment went awry last week, however, when a tractor-trailer loaded with bees crashed northeast of Sacramento.

The bees were coming from a Montana farm to escape cold weather, and would typically be kept in holding yards for months before being distributed to orchards. The Almond Board of California lists dozens of beekeepers and bee brokers from across the United States that will rent hives.

“It’s a real industrial endeavor now,” said Neal Williams, an associate professor of entomology at University of California, Davis, and the faculty co-director of its Honey and Pollination Center. “There is more money for most beekeepers in pollination compared to honey.”

Bees are vital to almond growers, Mr. Williams said, because the almond nut will not set unless pollen is transferred from one variety to another, which the bees do as they look for nectar. The bees benefit, too, because the crop is the first to bloom, in February or March, after the winter.

“They are going in at a time when they are very hungry,” Mr. Williams said.

Sgt. Tucker Huey of the Auburn Police Department, who responded to the crash scene, said initial hesitation to work among buzzing bees was unfounded.

“Some of the boxes broke and some of the lids came off during the crash,” Sergeant Huey said. “A lot of bees were free and flying around. They weren’t swarming too bad because it was dark and cool.”

The police and fire departments killed the bees with soapy water, Sergeant Huey said, on the recommendation of beekeepers who said the cargo could not be salvaged. Two people were stung, once each. He was spared.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, No. 16-111, will be argued before the Supreme Court next month. It has tested deep and longstanding commitments to free speech, and it has divided old allies.

Consider Eugene Volokh, a leading First Amendment scholar who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2013, he filed a brief supporting a wedding photographer who refused to document a same-sex union.

“Photographers, writers, singers, actors, painters and others who create First Amendment-protected speech must have the right to decide which commissions to take and which to reject,” Professor Volokh wrote in the brief, which he filed with Dale Carpenter, a law professor, and the Cato Institute, the libertarian group.

In the new case, Professor Volokh is on the other side. Cakes may be tasty and pretty, he wrote in a brief supporting the couple, but creating them is not expression protected by the First Amendment.

“A chef, however brilliant, cannot claim a free speech clause right not to serve certain people at his restaurant, even if his dishes look stunning,” Professor Volokh wrote. “The same is true for bakers, even ones who create beautiful cakes for use at weddings.”

Professor Carpenter agreed. But the Cato Institute took the opposite view, filing a brief supporting the baker, Jack Phillips. “The fact that Jack’s media are icing and chocolate rather than ink or paint does nothing to diminish the artistic content of his work,” the brief said.

Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with Cato, said he and his former allies agreed on the basic principles. Writers, singers, actors and painters are entitled to protection, he said, while caterers and limousine drivers are not. Bakers are a hard case, he said, because they are close to the line.

“If the Supreme Court establishes a precedent that if you’re engaged in an expressive profession you have First Amendment protection against being compelled to produce your product or provide your service, I would be very happy with that,” Mr. Shapiro said. “If it draws the line that excludes bakers but includes florists, or wherever that line is drawn, we can quibble over that, but that’s less important than establishing that there is a valid free speech defense against being forced to use your expressive abilities.”

Professor Volokh agreed, saying the dispute was over where, not whether, a line should be drawn.

“At some point, you have to decide what counts as speech and what doesn’t,” he said in an interview. “Otherwise, all human behavior could be said to be expressive.”

The brief filed by Mr. Abrams did not seek to draw lines between artists and others. “When an artist sells a message,” the brief said, “he must take all comers.”

Other prominent First Amendment scholars who generally take strong free speech positions also signed that brief, including Kathleen M. Sullivan, a former dean of Stanford Law School, and Geoffrey R. Stone, a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School. The brief was filed by Walter Dellinger, who was acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration.

There are big names on the other side, too. Among them are Michael W. McConnell of Stanford, Richard W. Garnett of Notre Dame and Randy E. Barnett of Georgetown, who signed a brief supporting Mr. Phillips, the baker. “The state’s effort to compel Phillips to use his artistic talents in a manner violative of his sincere convictions offends the vital constitutional commitment to freedom of expression,” the brief said.

Professor Volokh said that approach was too broad. The First Amendment, he said, protects only conduct that is inherently expressive or both meant and likely to send a message.

He said his disagreement with the Cato Institute about confectionary expression demonstrated that it was not always easy to decide what warrants First Amendment protection.

“It suggests that this case is not far from the borderline,” he said. “Until the lines are drawn, there can be considerable disputes about where the lines should be drawn.”",Where to Draw Line on Free Speech?

COLORADO SPRINGS — The 26-year-old gunman who entered a rural Texas church with a ballistic vest and a military-style rifle, killing at least 26 people on Sunday, had been trailed by trouble for years. Devin Patrick Kelley, a former member of the United States Air Force, had been convicted at court-martial and jailed for domestic abuse, kicked out of the military, divorced and charged with animal cruelty.

In 2012, while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Mr. Kelley was charged with “assault on his spouse and assault on their child” according to Ann Stefanek, the Air Force’s chief of media operations. He was convicted at court-martial and sentenced in November of that year to twelve months confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank, E-1. After his confinement, he was discharged from the military with a bad conduct discharge. It is unclear whether his conviction would have barred him from purchasing a gun.

That same year, he was divorced in New Mexico from his first wife, according to court records. When he was discharged from the Air Force in 2014, Mr. Kelley remarried in Texas to Danielle Lee Shields in April of that year, according to state records.

A few months later he registered to vote in Colorado Springs — a city with several Air Force bases — listing his address as parking space 60 at a shabby collection of trailers in a gravel lot called the Fountain Creek RV Park.

A woman living in a camper next door, who gave her name only as Susan, said a man of similar age and description lived in spot 60 for a few months during that time, but she never learned his name.

“He was kind of off, lived here with a woman,” she said as she loaded blankets into one of the RV Park’s washing machines.

He said hello a few times in passing but was never friendly and stayed only a few months. She never heard any arguments from his trailer.

“The only thing that sticks out about him was his dog,” she said.

He had a pit bull puppy that he kept tied up in the sun all day outside of his RV, she said. She also recalled an incident where police were called because the man had struck the dog in the head.

The police arrived and there was a standoff for approximately an hour, she said, in which her neighbor refused to come out of his trailer.

Records show Mr. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, in August 2014. The case was dismissed. He moved out a few weeks later, she said.

Mr. Kelley, whose father, Michael Kelley, is a computer programmer and accountant, enlisted in the Air Force soon after graduating from New Braunfels High School in 2009. Devin Kelly served as a low-ranking airman in a logistics readiness battalion. A Linkedin account in his name says he worked in cargo and distribution.

Video Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, opened fire in a church in rural Texas on Sunday, killing at least 26 people. He was pursued by residents and found dead in his car.

By 2017 he had returned to a house in New Braunfels that records show was owned by his parents. The house was about an hour from the church where the shooting occurred.

Michael Kelley, in a short biography posted on the website of his small software company, Dilloware, said the family has three children. Devin Kelley is the middle child.

“Building the company at the same time as our family involved a whirlwind of activity,” he wrote. “Lots of late hours and sacrifices.”

On Sunday, police cars from the Comal County Sheriff’s Department lined the gunman’s driveway on a rural stretch of land in New Braunfels. Wire fences kept visitors from the house, which was hidden by overgrown grass that fills the property.

Signs on a cattle gate at the entrance read “no trespassing” and “beware of dog”.

“I don’t know anybody down there,” said Sabas Gonzales, who can see Mr. Kelley’s driveway from hers. Ms. Gonzalez, 70, said she’d lived there for more than two decades and many of her neighbors had come over to introduce themselves when they moved in, but nobody from Mr. Kelley’s home ever stopped by.

“Out here, people tend to keep to themselves,” said Tim Daughtrey, who cuts cedar for clients in the area, and lives in walking distance from Mr. Kelley’s home. Mr. Daughtrey, 40, said the town was mostly uneventful, as far as crime goes. “I see a barroom fight every now and then, but never no shootings.”

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

In both groups, doctors threaded a catheter through the groin or wrist of the patient and, with X-ray guidance, up to the blocked artery.
Since the procedure carries some risks, including death, stents should be used only for people who are having heart attacks, she added.
In 2007, another large study led by Dr. Boden — also without an untreated control group — found stents did not prevent heart attacks or deaths from heart disease.
Mr. Stevens had a blocked artery, but the new report gave Dr. Nallamothu second thoughts.","The new study, published in the Lancet, stunned leading cardiologists by countering decades of clinical experience. The findings raise questions about whether stents should be used so often — or at all — to treat chest pain.

“It’s a very humbling study for someone who puts in stents,” said Dr. Brahmajee K. Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan.

Dr. William E. Boden, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine, called the results “unbelievable.”

Dr. David Maron, a cardiologist at Stanford University, praised the new study as “very well conducted” but said that it left some questions unanswered. The participants had a profound blockage but only in one artery, he noted, and they were assessed after just six weeks.

“We don’t know if the conclusions apply to people with more severe disease,” Dr. Maron said. “And we don’t know if the conclusions apply for a longer period of observation.”

For the study, Dr. Justin E. Davies, a cardiologist at Imperial College London, and his colleagues recruited 200 patients with a profoundly blocked coronary artery and chest pain severe enough to limit physical activity, common reasons for inserting a stent.

All were treated for six weeks with drugs to reduce the risk of a heart attack, like aspirin, a statin and a blood pressure drug, as well as medications that relieve chest pain by slowing the heart or opening blood vessels.

Then the subjects had a procedure: a real or fake insertion of a stent. This is one of the few studies in cardiology in which a sham procedure was given to controls who were then compared to patients receiving the actual treatment.

In both groups, doctors threaded a catheter through the groin or wrist of the patient and, with X-ray guidance, up to the blocked artery. Once the catheter reached the blockage, the doctor inserted a stent or, if the patient was getting the sham procedure, simply pulled the catheter out.

Photo

Neither the patients nor the researchers assessing them afterward knew who had received a stent. Following the procedure, both groups of patients took powerful drugs to prevent blood clots.

The stents did what they were supposed to do in patients who received them. Blood flow through the previously blocked artery was greatly improved.

When the researchers tested the patients six weeks later, both groups said they had less chest pain, and they did better than before on treadmill tests.

But there was no real difference between the patients, the researchers found. Those who got the sham procedure did just as well as those who got stents.

Cardiologists said one reason might be that atherosclerosis affects many blood vessels, and stenting only the largest blockage may not make much difference in a patient’s discomfort. Those who report feeling better may only be experiencing a placebo effect from the procedure.

“All cardiology guidelines should be revised,” Dr. David L. Brown of Washington University School of Medicine and Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an editorial published with the new study.

Clinical guidelines in the United States say stenting is appropriate for patients with a blocked artery and chest pain who have tried optimal medical therapy, meaning medications like those given to the study patients.

But those guidelines were based on studies in which patients simply said they felt better after having stents inserted.

“It was impressive how negative it was,” Dr. Redberg said of the new study. Since the procedure carries some risks, including death, stents should be used only for people who are having heart attacks, she added.

Stents came into wide use in the 1990s and became the treatment of choice because they were less invasive than bypass surgery. But there have long been questions about their effectiveness.

A large, federally funded study with Dr. Maron as a co-principal investigator, which does not have an untreated control group, is now underway to determine whether medications can be just as effective as stenting or coronary bypass in preventing heart attacks.

In 2007, another large study led by Dr. Boden — also without an untreated control group — found stents did not prevent heart attacks or deaths from heart disease.

The explanation, researchers said, was that atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease. A few arteries might be blocked today, and then reopened with stents. But tomorrow a blockage might arise in another artery and cause a heart attack.

Relieving chest pain, though, seemed a different goal to many cardiologists. After all, the heart is a muscle, and if a muscle is starved for blood, it aches.

Many patients have coronary arteries that are 80 to 90 percent blocked. Surely opening those vessels should make the patients feel better.

The idea that stenting relieves chest pain is so ingrained that some experts said they expect most doctors will continue with stenting, reasoning that the new research is just one study.

Even Dr. Davies hesitated to say patients like those he tested should not get stents. “Some don’t want drugs or can’t take them,” he said.

Stenting is so accepted that American cardiologists said they were amazed ethics boards agreed to a study with a sham control group.

But in the United Kingdom, said Dr. Davies, getting approval for the study was not so difficult. Neither was it difficult to find patients.

“There are many people who are open to research, and if you tell them you are exploring a question, people agree,” he said. Nonetheless, it took him three and a half years to find the subjects for his study.

Ethics boards at many American hospitals probably would resist, since giving such patients fake procedures “flies in the face of guidelines,” Dr. Boden said.

Placebo effects can be surprisingly powerful, said Dr. Neal Dickert, Jr., a cardiologist and ethicist at Emory University.

A few years ago, researchers — at the insistence of the Food and Drug Administration — did a study to test an invasive procedure to treat high blood pressure. The control group got a sham procedure.

The method was becoming popular in Europe, but the study found that blood pressure dropped just as much in those who had the fake treatment.

Dr. Dickert said he hoped the new stent study will show cardiologists that they need to do more studies with sham procedures.

“This may turn out to be an important moment,” he said.

But getting them underway in the United States may not be easy. Ethics boards at hospitals and universities are likely to resist, as are patients.

“It’s not just up to us,” said Dr. David Goff, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Still, the results of the new research have at least one heart specialist rethinking his practice.

Dr. Nallamothu got an advance look at the new paper on Tuesday. Coincidentally, he had a patient, Jim Stevens, 54, a lawyer in Troy, Mich., scheduled to receive a stent that day.

Mr. Stevens had a blocked artery, but the new report gave Dr. Nallamothu second thoughts. “I took him off the table,” he said.

He explained to Mr. Stevens and his wife that he did not need a stent. “I was surprised,” Mr. Stevens said.

There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last year’s polls were too favorable to Democrats. It’s likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines. The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nation’s leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.

One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the poll’s final estimate. For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference. It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governor’s race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll. With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.

Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen

There are a few pollsters in Virginia — like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac — that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election. Most others weren’t weighting by education before 2016 and aren’t weighting by it today.

The disparity can be extreme. Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates. Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll. A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate. A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.

The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesn’t mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016. By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trump’s way appears to have done so. Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters. There’s also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.

But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.

Education Is a Mystery

It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes. But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.

It’s not completely unreasonable. Last year’s polling error was an odd one. It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences. There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan. But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent. Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.

If pollsters didn’t take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error. Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone else’s, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump. And most public pollsters didn’t conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.

Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didn’t think education was decisive. Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.

But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: It’s hard for pollsters to even know if they’re getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.

“I don’t weight to education because it’s pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education,” said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls. “That’s not something that’s necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.”

He’s right. It’s not easy to weight by education, and it’s especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files — the “big data” that powers most campaigning polling and analytics. Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.

Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate. R.D.D. surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election. Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D. have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.

View all New York Times newsletters.

But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files. To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere — something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do. Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.

What’s the alternative? A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isn’t a definitive benchmark for weighting. There still isn’t universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: There’s a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.

The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.

These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters. But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.

All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.

“This is the first time ever that I’ve weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018,” said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, “because education is a pretty damn good predictor.”

For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem — and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side. The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.

Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now they’re generally doing more. There’s still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change — uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.

“It’s kind of a cop-out,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. “You can’t say I can’t deal with education because I don’t know the exact weight of it. You wouldn’t not weight on race because you couldn’t figure it out.”

Is It Enough?

The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.

The cause for debate is simple. Even weighting by education wouldn’t have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge. One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.

But there’s a more ominous possibility. It wasn’t just that polls didn’t capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didn’t get the right less educated white voters.

Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas. Maybe they missed those who don’t work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture. Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.

If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve. Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since “baristas aren’t exchangeable with factory workers,” as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it. Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.

The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but it’s nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry. That’s in part because there’s limited public evidence to support it at this stage. It’s also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible. But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.

Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future. But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms. If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, it’s hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.","After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Haven’t Changed Anything",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/upshot/after-a-tough-2016-many-pollsters-havent-changed-anything.html

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Thanks for dropping by, Mr. Kaskel.

At around 11:20 a.m. local time, the gunman, identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, exited his vehicle and opened fire with a rifle outside the church, according a spokesman of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Mr. Kelley, who was wearing all-black tactical gear and a mask, then entered the church, and continued to fire inside. Most of the victims were found inside the church. Two were found outside.

After Mr. Kelley exited the church, he shot at residents who had come outside. A church neighbor returned fire with a rifle and hit the gunman. Mr. Kelley got into his vehicle and fled north towards Guadalupe County, with neighbors driving after him in pursuit.

First Baptist Church is in Sutherland Springs, Tex., about 30 miles east of San Antonio. Mr. Kelley lived in New Braunfels, Tex., a city about 35 miles north of the shooting.

China plans to return the favor when Mr. Trump arrives Wednesday for what the Chinese Foreign Ministry says is his first visit to Beijing. The Chinese are calling it “a state visit-plus,” promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City.

The welcome is designed to make Mr. Trump feel important, reflecting the belief of at least some Chinese officials that they know just how to handle an outspoken tycoon with a big ego.

But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his “China Dream” — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world.

Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a “new type of great power relations,” the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.

The concept is closely associated with Mr. Xi, who has been pitching it since he was vice president. But the Obama administration viewed it as code for allowing China to establish a sphere of influence in Asia, with the United States withdrawing to minimize conflict.

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told state news media last week he hoped Mr. Trump’s visit would revive the idea and allow the two nations to build a “constructive partnership.” The vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, said the two leaders would discuss a “blueprint” for developing relations.

Chinese analysts believe the timing works to Mr. Xi’s advantage. Mr. Trump will be arriving as he faces new questions about the Russia investigation at home and criticism abroad for appearing to abandon American leadership on issues from climate change to trade liberalization.

In contrast, Mr. Xi has been basking in the aftermath of a party congress last month that elevated him to the same status as the nation’s founding father, Mao Zedong.

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Xi has positioned China as a stable alternative to the United States, willing to take on the obligations of global leadership and invest in big infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe much as the United States did after World War II.

“China, for the first time, is not in a humble position regarding the United States,” said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Usually the American president has the advantage. This is the first time there is an equal relationship between the two leaders.”

Mr. Xi is now the unquestioned paramount leader of China, Professor Yan added, while Mr. Trump only “represents himself.”

Photo

Asked on Sunday about the disparity, Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States. “We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Xi may also be counting on personal chemistry between the two men. They appeared to bond when they first met at Mr. Trump’s Florida estate in April, and Mr. Trump has since called Mr. Xi numerous times, often to ask him to get tougher on North Korea.

In interviews, Mr. Trump has frequently praised Mr. Xi and described him as a friend, often in effusive terms unusual for an American president speaking of the leader of China’s authoritarian, one-party state. At times, Mr. Trump has even repeated points made by Mr. Xi in their conversations.

Still, Chinese officials, known for their attention to detail and protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries, appear to be somewhat on edge over what Mr. Trump might say, and how he might say it, during the visit.

Twitter is blocked in China, but it is generally accessible on foreign cellphones. “How President Trump communicates with the outside — this is not something you need to worry about,” said Mr. Zheng, the vice minister, when asked if the American president would be able to use his favorite social media platform.

Beijing’s anxieties about the visit are due at least in part to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s view of China.

Mr. Trump’s call to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific” emphasizing Australia, India and Japan echoes the view of the national security establishment in Washington that China’s growing clout in Asia must be managed or even contained.

But Mr. Trump has also embraced those who say the United States must take a much tougher position on trade with China, including Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. They say that Beijing is exploiting America’s openness while keeping its own markets closed, and Washington must insist on reciprocity even at the risk of a trade war.

This clashes with a third view in the administration, often associated with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that considers China an inseparable economic partner and business opportunity for the United States.

Photo

Mr. Kushner served as go-between in arranging the president’s first meeting with Mr. Xi but has taken a lower profile since then, in part, officials have said, because of concerns about his efforts to bring Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures.

John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, tilted the White House away from criticism of Beijing in an interview on Fox News last week, saying China had beaten the United States on trade but “that doesn’t make them an enemy.”

He also said that China has “a system of government that has apparently worked for the Chinese people.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The remarks drew heckles from many in Washington who cited China’s human rights record but praise from the Chinese news media as reflecting the more equal relationship that Mr. Xi seeks.

Mr. Trump’s top concern is expected to be North Korea and its nuclear arsenal, and many analysts believe Mr. Xi will use the potential for greater Chinese pressure on North Korea to draw Mr. Trump closer to embracing a “great power” relationship.

“As Trump needs Xi’s help with the North Korean challenge and as he is not a traditional realist, he may agree, to the chagrin of his advisers,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.

Accepting China as a partner has been a fraught proposition for Mr. Trump’s predecessors. When former President Bill Clinton agreed to work toward “ a constructive strategic partnership in the 21st century,” he was criticized for cozying up to China just a few years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Two decades later, human rights in China remains a potential point of friction, with some in the administration lobbying Mr. Trump to press Mr. Xi on the fate of Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in July after eight years in prison.

Like the Obama administration in its latter years, though, Mr. Trump has not made a priority of such issues, even as Mr. Xi has conducted a sweeping crackdown on civil society.

Over the weekend, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia announced the arrests of 11 of his princely cousins, among them some of the kingdom’s most prominent businessmen; he also announced several dramatic changes to top government ministries, including the creation of a powerful new anticorruption committee. Why? Was it a coup? The response to a failed coup? Some kind of purge?

The background to these events is the continuing centralization of power in the hands of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is one of King Salman’s sons. Over the past two years he has taken over most of the key economic and security posts and has clearly emerged as the most important operator in the government. The crown prince is also deputy prime minister (under the king, who is also prime minister) and minister of defense. All this at the age of 32.

This steady seizure of power has given rise to resistance within and outside the royal family, and Mohammed bin Salman’s elevation to crown prince was not unanimously supported when the top royal princes met to approve it. In the Saudi system, power has been passed among the sons of the founder of the modern Saudi kingdom, known as Ibn Saud, since his death in 1953. That made the king more primus inter pares than absolute monarch. One king was removed by his brothers (Saud, in 1964), and the system has permitted fiefs: The late King Abdullah was head of the National Guard for decades, and his son Miteb bin Abdullah took it over after his death; the late Prince Nayef served as minister of interior for 37 years and his son came after him; the late Prince Sultan was minister of defense for nearly a half century, and his son Khalid was his deputy.

Crown Prince Mohammed is putting an end to all that, taking some of those posts himself and removing others from the seemingly permanent control of any one branch of the family. All power is going to his branch — to his father, himself and his own allies; one brother is now the new Saudi ambassador to the United States.

Among the most notable moves was the removal of Prince Miteb — son and close adviser of Salman’s predecessor, the late King Abdullah — as head of the National Guard. You don’t need to be addicted to “Game of Thrones” to see the logic in that move: don’t allow a potential rival to keep his hands on a major locus of military power in the kingdom. Similarly, the arrest of perhaps the kingdom’s richest man, the billionaire international investor Alwaleed bin Talal, will both clip his wings and send a message that no one is beyond reach.

It was possible to pass the post of king from brother to brother in order of age when there were only 36 brothers who lived to adulthood, and that is what the Saudis have been doing since 1953 until King Salman’s accession to the throne in 2015.

Those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks, as filing and fund-raising deadlines for next year’s election approach. Just how high could depend on the success or failure of Republicans’ latest legislative push, an ambitious rewrite of the federal tax code that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has pledged to get through the chamber in a matter of weeks. Should the effort fail, current and former lawmakers said, the number of demoralized Republicans leaving the chamber could jump.

“Each of us will have our own individual stories, but the promise of unified government is much more difficult, cumbersome and elusive than we ever thought it would be,” said Mr. Chaffetz, 50, who stepped down in June to take a job at Fox News. “You have people who are frustrated they can’t get their legislation to the finish line.”

Republican campaign strategists and congressional aides said they were watching at least two other committee chairmen facing term limits for potential retirements: Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, who is the chairman of the Transportation Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Smith, a long-serving conservative and former Judiciary Committee chairman, said the decision to retire was largely personal. He wrote on Thursday that with his chairmanship ending and a new grandchild arriving, the time felt right to step aside after 16 terms.

“It is humbling living in a small apartment in Washington four nights a week,” he wrote. “And I seldom leave the office before late at night.”

Mr. Smith took over the science panel in 2013 and turned it into a powerful counterweight to Obama administration environmental policy. He subpoenaed scientists, accused federal agencies working on climate change of engaging in scientific fraud and supported stripping NASA of much of its climate change research. News of his departure has been as polarizing as his chairmanship.

Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, and a leading contrarian of the scientific consensus on global warming, said Mr. Smith’s retirement was a “huge loss to the science community.”

Scientists who have clashed with him, though, said they were hopeful that his departure would mark a return to a less adversarial body.

“Chairman Smith misused his position to subpoena federal researchers, sow doubt about scientific facts and push bills that would undermine the role of science in policy,” said Andrew Rosenberg, the director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“I hope that the next representative to serve as chair will return this committee to its intended purpose: strengthening America’s scientific enterprise, providing thoughtful and constructive oversight of federal policy and protecting the health and safety of the people Congress is supposed to serve,” he said.

Mr. Hensarling, 60, cut a less divisive but still influential figure on Capitol Hill. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hensarling was one of the House’s leading lieutenants in the Republican fight to scale back the government’s role in regulating the economy. In June, the House passed Mr. Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, which would dismantle many of the Obama-era banking regulations codified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

He also broke with big business in his crusade to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, the government agency that guarantees loans for the overseas customers of American exporters. That effort put him at odds with many members of his party, even on his committee.

The push has so far failed, but the agency’s largest transactions have been crippled for nearly two and a half years by conservative actions on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Hensarling, who has been in the House since 2003, wrote in a letter explaining his decision on Tuesday that he had already stayed longer in Washington than he had intended and the end of his chairmanship provided a natural break. And given his position, he will be a strong candidate for a lucrative next act in the private sector.

But his work in Washington was marked by frustration, as well. A sign of how difficult it has been to see legislation into law: His Financial Choice Act stands a slim chance of passing the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority.

Dick Armey, a former House majority leader under Mr. Gingrich and a fellow Texan, said Mr. Hensarling’s departure struck him as premature and a casualty of the sort that Republicans had brought upon themselves.

“I have no doubt he’s frustrated,” Mr. Armey said. “You can’t be as able and as innovative a guy as Jeb is without being frustrated right now.”

Others drew different lessons.

Representative Louie Gohmert, a Tea Party conservative who has clashed with party leadership over the years, said the departures of his fellow Texans, Mr. Smith and Mr. Hensarling, were merely part of the natural cycle of life in the House.

And over the last several weeks he has ordered enough high-profile arrests of intellectuals and clerics to frighten the remainder of the academic and religious establishment into acceding to his will as well.

Apolitical scholars who used to speak freely in cafes now look nervously over their shoulders, as Crown Prince Mohammed has achieved a degree of dominance that no ruler has attained for generations.

“It is the coup de grâce of the old system,” said Chas W. Freeman, a former United States ambassador. “Gone. All power has now been concentrated in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.”

Why the crown prince acted now — whether to eliminate future opposition or perhaps to crush some threat he saw brewing — was not immediately clear.

At 32 years old, he had little experience in government before his father, King Salman, 81, ascended to the throne in 2015, and the prince has demonstrated little patience for the previously staid pace of change in the kingdom.

He has led Saudi Arabia into a protracted military conflict in Yemen and a bitter feud with its Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar. He has taken on a business elite accustomed to state subsidies and profligacy by laying out radical plans to remake the Saudi economy, lessen its dependence on oil and rely instead on foreign investment. And he has squared off against conservatives in the religious establishment with symbolic steps to loosen strict moral codes, including a pending end to the longstanding ban on women driving.

Crown Prince Mohammed’s haste, however, may now come at a price, because the lack of transparency or due process surrounding the anticorruption crackdown is sure to unnerve the same private investors he hopes to attract — including through a planned stock offering of the huge state oil company, Aramco.

Saudi Arabian businessmen and royals anxious about the crown prince’s plans were quietly moving assets out of the country even before the arrests.

“Some of these are businessmen with international status, and if they are caught in this web then it could happen to anyone,” said James M. Dorsey, who studies Saudi Arabia at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “How is that going to inspire confidence and attract foreign investment?”

The Saudi Arabian news media, however, celebrated the arrests as a long-awaited cleanup, appealing to populist resentment of self-enrichment enjoyed by the sprawling royal family and its closest allies.

Almost everyone in the capital, Riyadh, and other big cities like Jidda has heard stories about princes absconding with vast sums that had been allocated for a public project.

The arrests are “a frontal assault on some members of the royal family and the impunity with which they have operated in the past,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.

“It was something that had to be done,” he said, even though the absence of a judicial process “sends a chill down the spine of foreign investors.”

President Trump on Sunday appeared to give a tacit endorsement of the arrests in a phone call with King Salman. A White House summary of the call contained no references to the arrests, and said Mr. Trump had praised Crown Prince Mohammed for other matters.

Three White House advisers, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned just days ago from the latest in at least three high-level Trump administration visits to Saudi Arabia this year.

Nearly 24 hours after the arrests were announced, no Saudi authority or spokesman had identified those arrested or the charges against them.

The Saudi-owned satellite network Al Arabiya reported only that a large number of arrests, including 11 princes, had been ordered by an “anticorruption committee” that just hours earlier had been formed under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed. A royal decree granted the committee powers to detain individuals or seize assets without any trial, process or disclosure.

A list of those arrested began circulating over social media shortly after midnight Sunday, and by Sunday evening senior government officials were reposting the list. News organizations around the region were reporting its contents without contradiction by either the Saudi government or individuals.

In the case of the most politically potent of the detainees, the former security chief Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the Saudi government appeared on Sunday to have started a social media campaign seeking to make him the new face of public corruption.

Analysts said the list appeared to reflect individuals with a reputation for self-enrichment and those representing rival power centers within the kingdom. Others included the power broker who once ran the royal court under King Abdullah, and the owner of one of the biggest private media companies in the region.

But another was a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed himself — Adel Fakeih — who had been considered a driving force behind the ambitious program of economic reform, leaving analysts puzzled about the motives.

In what appeared to be an unrelated episode, a helicopter carrying another Saudi royal, Prince Mansur bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir Province, which borders Yemen, crashed on Sunday, killing the prince along with a number of other officials. Al Arabiya, which reported the crash in a brief dispatch, did not identify the cause.

The history of the House of Saud was sometimes punctuated by violent intrafamily strife in the decades before the founding of the modern dynasty, in 1932. Since then, the family has maintained its unity in part by spreading its top government roles and vast oil wealth among different branches of the sprawling clan. Most important was the division of the three main security services, which constitute the hard power on the ground.

King Salman, however, quickly named his favorite son, Mohammed, as his defense minister, chief of the royal court, a top economic adviser and deputy crown prince. Then, this June, the king removed his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, from his position as crown prince and his powerful role of interior minister in charge of the internal security forces, secret police and counterterrorism operations. Evidently anxious to forestall resistance, the king also placed the demoted nephew under house arrest. A campaign of leaks spread rumors that he had become addicted to painkillers and other drugs.

It was unclear why the crackdown targeted Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is best known for his past and present investments in brand-name Western companies including Twitter, News Corporation, Apple and the Four Seasons. Prince Alwaleed has been a vocal supporter of the crown prince’s plans to attract outside investors to Saudi Arabia. But when a committee of 34 senior family members — known as the allegiance council — approved Prince Mohammed’s elevation to crown prince, one of the three dissenters was from Prince Alwaleed’s branch of the family, the Talals, according to people familiar with the voting.

Michael Stephens, who studies Saudi Arabia at the Royal United Services Institute in London, recalled the bloody purges other leaders in the region have sometimes used to eliminate rivals. What Crown Prince Mohammed was doing, Mr. Stephens said, “is a more genteel way of making sure there are no challenges to your power.”

Time will tell, Mr. Stephens said, whether the arrests signal a slide into despotism or “whether we will look back and say Mohammed bin Salman is the one guy who saw the wall coming and managed to hurdle it.”",Saudi Crown Prince’s Mass Purge Upends a Longstanding System,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/middleeast/saudi-crown-prince-purge.html

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — Law enforcement officers investigating the mass shooting at a church that killed 26 people here said on Monday that “a domestic situation” within the family may have motivated the killing.

“ The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said during a news conference Monday morning. “We know that he had made threatening texts and we can’t go into detail into that domestic situation that is continuing to be vetted and thoroughly investigated.”

“This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs, it was a domestic situation going on,” Martin added.

The moments following the horrific mass shooting on Sunday morning came into clearer view on Monday morning, as the county sheriff detailed a firefight and car chase that ended with the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, 26, dead after a crash.

The recurrent bursts of gunfire were the first sign of trouble at the First Baptist Church in this rural Texas town, but even that said little about the horrors that had befallen the faithful at their house of worship. Inside, pools of blood splattered across the small church led back to dozens of dead and dying parishioners.

As many as 14 children and a pregnant woman lay lifeless. Those dead inside the church ranged from 18 months to 77 years of age, according to law enforcement officials.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said that law enforcement found “blood everywhere” inside the church. “Wherever you walked in the church, there was death,” he said.

Sheriff Tackitt said that he believes that the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went around the outside of the church firing rounds before entering and shooting at parishioners. After Mr. Kelley exited the church, he and an armed bystander engaged in a brief “fire fight” before the suspect went into his vehicle, according to the sheriff. The gunman had dropped his rifle in the church after slaughtering the parishioners; he pulled a pistol during his exchange with the bystander.

Mr. Kelley contacted his father from his cell phone during the chase to tell him that he had been shot, according to law enforcement. Mr. Kelley told his father that he “didn’t think he was going to make it.” He subsequently shot himself, though officials said they were not yet sure if that shot had caused his death.

Left behind at the church alongside the bodies were 30-round clips and “dozens of rounds” of ammunition, potentially hundreds. The sheriff said had seen nothing to suggest that the shooter modified his weapon to make it act like an automatic firearm, like the gunman who used a “bump stock” in the mass shooting in Las Vegas.

The sheriff described a “horrific” and methodical killing inside the church. Mr. Kelley appeared to have begun at the front of the church, having “shot his way in,” and fired his weapon from side to side as he paced through the room.

“There was nothing anyone could do until he came out,” Sheriff Joe Tackitt said. Mr. Tackitt later declined to give more information about what had happened inside the church.

The bystander — who Sheriff Tackitt said is a “hero” but declined to give his name — then waved down a man in a vehicle and the two began pursuing the gunman, Sheriff Tackitt said in an interview with CBS, and may have engaged in a firefight along the way before the gunman’s vehicle crashed into a fence.

Johnnie Langendorff, in an interview with local ABC News television affiliate KSAT, said that he sprang to action after he encountered the two men exchanging gunfire. After the armed bystander explained the situation, the two took off after the gunman. “He got a little bit of a jump on us. We were doing about 95” miles per hour “around traffic and everything. Eventually he came to a slowdown and we got within just a few feet of him and he got off the road.”

Langendorff said that the gunman lost control of his vehicle. Langendorff parked and the armed bystander drew his rifle, which he kept trained on the gunman’s vehicle until police officers arrived on the scene about five minutes later, he said. The two men had been on the phone with police dispatch during the chase.

The in-laws and Mr. Kelley’s ex-wife were interviewed by investigators last night in Sutherland Springs. They were not in the town at the time of the shooting, according to law enforcement officials.

Mr. Kelley was clad in all black, with a ballistic vest strapped to his chest and a military-style rifle in his hands, when he opened fire on parishioners, turning this tiny town east of San Antonio into the scene of the country’s newest mass horror.

He had served in the Air Force at a base in New Mexico but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Mr. Kelley did not have a license to carry, according to investigators who briefed the news media on Monday morning, but he had a private security license “similar to a security guard at a concert,” according to investigators. Three weapons belonging to Mr. Kelley were recovered during the investigation — a rifle at the church and two handguns in his car.","In Texas Shooting, Gunman Kills at Least 26",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The inventor of the wheel is long lost to time, but Craig Donnelly sends his thanks anyway.

Mr. Donnelly, who runs the American operation for the German wheel maker BBS, is driven by wheels: cast alloy, magnesium, forged aluminum, painted silver or black or titanium, large enough to fill a wheel well on a Ford truck or dainty enough to fit a decades-old MG sports car.

BBS is one of several companies that cover both sides of the automotive wheel world: making flashy stock wheels built specifically for carmakers, as well as aftermarket replacements for car owners who are seeking better performance or more personality. And the buyers are not necessarily the hot-rodders and street racers you would expect.

“Over all, wheel design and colors options and styling is more in line with where the market is nowadays,” Mr. Donnelly said.

For many drivers, the spinning metal on our cars is a nonissue, usually worthy of attention only if it bends, or cracks, or breaks. Tires require more attention, with pressure warning lights and all the hazards that may illuminate them. Considering the abuses they suffer, tires are generally reliable on-the-road companions. But they are usually a sooty black, and often aren’t much to look at.

But wheels, even in that same hue, are jewelry for your car.

“Black wheels, very popular,” said Matt Edmonds, executive vice president of the Tire Rack, one of the nation’s largest aftermarket wheel retailers. “Five-spoke wheels are resurrected. Mesh wheels. In the S.U.V. market, people want an off-road racing look, with fake assembly bolts. It’s like any fashion industry.”

The Tire Rack has seen the benefits — its sales of aftermarket wheels have increased 25 percent since 2009, Mr. Edmonds said.

“The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said.

At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers.

Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements.

“When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.”

Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car.

“More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens.

Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches.

They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot.

“Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei.

Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is.

“That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said.

Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000.

Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet.

“Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.”

Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.

That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair.

“You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.”

And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.”

The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles.

“We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said.

For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression.

“You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings. Wheels make a car that much more emotionally appealing.”

A prankster who liked to provoke — as the anonymous street artist Banksy has done since the 1990s — Mr. Hambleton came to public attention in the mid- to late 1970s by painting faux crime-scene outlines of bodies on pavement and adding “blood,” hoping to make people believe that a serial murderer was on the loose.

He began this “Image Mass Murder” series in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia, and then took it down the West Coast and across North America. He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.

“I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene,” Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in “Shadowman,” a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby. After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that “this may be something else, but I didn’t have any language for it.”

Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.

“I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint,” he says in the documentary, adding, “Blood has a beautiful color.”

Announcing that “Dick Trace-It,” also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the “murders” in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of “Mr. Reee” for the crimes.

In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere. He called it “I Only Have Eyes for You.” The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.

His early “Shadowman” period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases. By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades. Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a “black lung” effect.

Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952. His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.

After graduating from the Emily Carr University of Art & Design in Vancouver, he started the Pumps Center for Alternative Art, a gallery, performance and video space, in the same city.

By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings. “I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility,” he says in the documentary. “It’s about love.”

Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambleton’s paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early “Shadowman” work had not fully left him.

“There are three paintings called ‘Rainstorm,’ in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas,” Mr. Brenson wrote. “In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.”

Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his “beautiful” period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.

But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene. Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become “paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.”

His life had begun to unravel. His drug use continued. His skin cancer worsened. He lived in increasing squalor.

“His goal was to reach the sublime,” Ms. Woodward said. “He used drugs to get there. It was just who he was.”

In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani. For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.

The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible. But the moment did not last long. While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail. His cancer was eroding his face. His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions. He used his folding bicycle as a walker. At times he was homeless.

“At least Basquiat, you know, died,” he says bitingly in the documentary, during a scene shot in 2014. “I was alive when I died, you know.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, insists that indictments against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates have “nothing to do with the president’s campaign or campaign activity.” Administration officials dismiss the alleged criminal activity by Mr. Manafort, formerly President Trump’s campaign chairman, as being merely about money-laundering and Ukraine — but not Russia, the focus of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

In the context of the standoff between democracy and autocracy, his legal and potentially illicit activities demonstrate that he ultimately took a side.

From the moment Ukraine declared itself a state, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the country found itself torn between Western Europe and Russia. Ukrainians living in the western half of Ukraine aspired to membership in the European Union and NATO, while those in the eastern half near the city of Donetsk oriented themselves toward Russia, which exerted maximum influence to keep Ukraine closely aligned.

In 2004, the European Union and NATO experienced a burst of membership expansion to countries bordering Ukraine and Russia, including the formerly Soviet Baltic States, much to the consternation of the Kremlin. That year, the presidential candidate for the pro-Russia Party of Regions was the former Donetsk regional governor, Viktor F. Yanukovych. The battle to lead the nation had become part of the broader competition between the democratic West and Russia.

“It was really important to me that the impact of these findings not be reduced to the same old conversation about the ‘black’ and ‘white’ of our country’s history,” he said in an email, referring to the research project, “but instead, were underlined as implicating any- and everybody on this campus — in this town, even.”

Under the Liberty Trees

Photo

The first nine presidents of Princeton owned slaves, many of them during their tenures there. In the 18th-century, prospective students had to present themselves to the university president for examination, so first person an applicant encountered at Princeton may have been an enslaved person who answered the door at the at the president’s house on Nassau Street.

Ms. Mann’s play, “Under the Liberty Trees,” is based on a 1766 newspaper advertisement for a slave auction in front of the house, when the property of Samuel Finley, Princeton’s fifth president, was sold after his death. The “liberty trees” in front, according to campus lore, had been planted a few months earlier to celebrate the repeal of the hated Stamp Act.

Ms. Mann, whose plays include “Having Our Say” (based on the memoir by two centenarian African-American sisters, the Delanys), said the project’s research had reshaped her mental geography.

“I see this town completely differently now,” she said. “Princeton is such a microcosm of race in America. So much more has happened here than people realize.”

Freedom on Trial

But what struck Regina Taylor hardest were newspaper articles about James Collins Johnson, a janitor at Princeton who was arrested in 1843 and put on trial after a white student identified him as a fugitive slave.

“Here was an African-American man who escapes slavery, names himself and believes that he was a free man, but then finds that he was not able to become a free man as he chooses, according to the Constitution of the United States,” Ms. Taylor said.

Ms. Taylor’s play, “James Johnson: Princeton and the Constitution,” uses beat-boxing and overlapping intergenerational voices to tell Johnson’s irony-rich story. At trial, he contested the identification. Ultimately, a local white woman purchased his freedom for today’s equivalent of well over $10,000 — money that Johnson had to pay back. Johnson continued to work as a campus vendor for decades, and was buried in 1902 under a headstone, paid for by Princeton alumni, calling him “the students’ friend.”

Ms. Taylor, who will direct a revival of her gospel musical “Crowns” at the McCarter next spring, connects the injustice of Johnson’s debt with the school-to-prison pipeline today.

“Ava DuVernay’s film ‘13th’ lays it out,” she said. “How we’re still paying off the debt of our forefathers, the obstacles we still face to being a free person with full ownership of self.”

Talking Back to Statues

Earlier this year, Nathan Alan Davis (“Nat Turner in Jerusalem”) toured the campus with Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the research project. One stop was an imposing statue of John Witherspoon, an early Princeton president and signer of the Declaration of Independence, which was erected in 2001.

Mr. Davis had been thinking about the continuing national controversies over monuments and naming, and had followed the debate at Princeton in 2015 over the legacy of Woodrow Wilson. “When I saw the statue and learned that Witherspoon owned slaves, I thought, ‘Here we go,’” he said.

“The Torch” features a conversation between Witherspoon’s statue and a blowtorch wielding African-American student named Jasmine, who quite literally holds his feet to the fire. Like a number of the other plays, it takes off from history but is very much in the present tense, connecting the legacy of slavery with contemporary issues like policing (introduced via an African-American officer who intervenes in Jasmine’s interrogation of the statue).

“Often with narratives about slavery, people say, ‘Oh, this terrible thing happened, it’s too bad, but thank God we’re not doing that anymore,’” Mr. Davis said. “But I don’t want to let anybody off the proverbial hook. We can’t simply look at slavery as an episode we have overcome. It’s still present.”",Putting the Ghosts of Princeton’s Racial Past Onstage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/arts/putting-the-ghosts-of-princetons-racial-past-onstage.html

Then the search for the song’s origin began.

Lenya had mentioned the song before, but under a different title, “Song of the Blind Maiden.” In the 1960s, she attempted to find the song but came up empty. “Nowhere to be found,” she said at the time. “Probably buried in some basement.”

Weill scholars thought the song Lenya remembered was written for “Das Lied von Hoboken,” a German translation of the American play “Hoboken Blues” that starred Lenya at the Volksbühne in 1930. But, Mr. Juchem said, the lyric by Günther Weisenborn didn’t quite fit in the context of the play.

So Mr. Juchem looked into the name of the Weimar-era faith healer mentioned in the song, Joseph Weissenberg (1855-1941), who was a charismatic evangelist with thousands of followers in Berlin and used cottage cheese and prayer as treatment.

“He formed a real sect, and he was a constant feature in the Berlin tabloids” at the same time that Kurt Weill was reaching the height of his fame as a young composer in the city, Mr. Juchem said.

It was in newspapers that Mr. Juchem eventually found the origin of “Song of the White Cheese,” which Weill wrote for a politically charged revue to benefit actors who had been laid off from the Volksbühne in November 1931. (Other artists who participated included Brecht and the composer Hanns Eisler.)

The song tells the story of a blind girl treated — unsuccessfully — by Weissenberg. It jokingly nods to the Lutheran chorale “Lord, Take My Hand and Lead Me” and ends with the girl wondering whether it would be better for everyone to be blind, so nobody would have to see “what’s currently going on in this world.”

At the time, Germany was in a political crisis as the Nazi party rose to power, and aftershocks of the Great Depression had reached Europe. “Song of the White Cheese” is very much a song of its time — a “zeit” song — Mr. Kowalke said.

Although the song’s satire was easy to grasp for Berliners of the time, much of it would be lost on most people today. “What do we do if the topical references have disappeared?” Mr. Kowalke said. He added that when it is published and recorded in English, “We might probably put an alternative lyric for Weissenberg’s name.”

How the song ended up in Gerda Schaefer’s collection is still a mystery. One theory, Mr. Juchem said, is that Lenya, who had to begin performances for the Berlin production of Weill and Brecht’s “Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,” may have sung in the revue only once or twice, then passed on the song to Schaefer.

That the song was never published isn’t unusual for Weill, who was often so busy he didn’t take the time to do that even for more major works like “Das Berliner Requiem,” Mr. Kowalke said.",Hear a Newly Found Kurt Weill Song That Surprised Experts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/arts/music/kurt-weill-song-of-the-white-cheese-discovered.html

Where most Republicans take it as an article of faith that passing a tax bill would buoy the party in 2018, lawmakers in these areas worry that a law burdening the suburbs would doom them.","Representative Lee M. Zeldin of New York, a Republican from a similar district on Long Island, said it would be impossible for him to vote for the bill in its current form. Mr. Zeldin said he would favor a “big, beautiful tax cut,” but not one that took aim so directly at blue-state taxpayers.

“I view it as a geographic redistribution of wealth,” Mr. Zeldin said. “You’re taking more money from a state like New York, to pay for a deeper tax cut elsewhere.”

The potential backlash for suburban Republicans is significant. While the party’s base is mainly rural and culturally conservative, a small group of solidly Democratic states with complex local tax codes could, in theory, nearly cost Republicans control of the House. In New Jersey alone, there are as many as five Republican-held districts where the tax plan is likely to be unpopular; add in those in New York and California and the number approaches 20. To gain a majority, Democrats must take two dozen seats away from the G.O.P., and they have already been hungrily eyeing the educated suburbs where President Trump is unpopular.

The tax bill, pushed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House’s chief tax writer, would cut tax rates for many individuals and businesses, but would void or sharply limit a range of popular deductions. Of particular concern in New Jersey are proposals to put a cap of $10,000 on the property taxes that can be deducted at the federal level; to eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes; and to restrict the mortgage interest deduction to loans of $500,000 or less.

The changes to deductions would raise more than $1 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, to help offset the $2 trillion cost of lowering tax rates and doubling the standard deduction.

Nationwide, about one-fifth of all taxpayers claim the state and local tax deduction, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, but the proportion is much higher in New Jersey, where more than one-third claim the deduction, with an average of about $11,000 a year. In value terms, two states — California and New York — account for nearly one-third of the total claimed nationwide.

The House Ways and Means Committee will begin considering and amending the bill on Monday, with the goal of passing it out to the House floor by the end of the week. The Senate is expected to introduce its own version of the bill in a few days.

Most Republicans from New Jersey and New York have opposed the legislation in its earliest drafts, forcing congressional leaders to advance it with the narrowest of majority votes. Republican leaders in both states’ legislatures denounced the bill, and Kim Guadagno, the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, said in an interview that she would push the state’s congressional delegation to “condemn it.”

Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey State Assembly, said the party’s polling consistently found taxes to be a singular and overwhelming issue for voters. The state’s members of Congress, he said, had to fight fiercely for its fiscal interests.

“When you represent New Jersey, it’s extremely important to stand up for New Jersey,” said Mr. Bramnick.

In California, another state likely to be hit especially hard by the tax proposals, Republicans have been more supportive of the House bill, a dynamic that lawmakers attribute to the influence of Representative Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is the House majority leader.

But key blue-state Republicans face an agonizing balancing act, weighing their ambition to deliver broad tax cuts with the narrower interests of their districts. Where most Republicans take it as an article of faith that passing a tax bill would buoy the party in 2018, lawmakers in these areas worry that a law burdening the suburbs would doom them.

In New Jersey’s 11th District, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen already figured to face a stiff challenge in 2018 before the vote to approve consideration of the tax legislation, an important procedural step. He was one of few Republicans from the Northeast to vote in favor, and the only one from New Jersey. His vote did not sit well in his district, an affluent and well-educated area where the average household income is more than $100,000 a year.

Outside her office in a development of high-end stores and condos in Livingston, N.J., Vicki Stout, 55, said she had voted for Mr. Frelinghuysen in the past, but might reconsider her support. Ms. Stout, a real estate agent who is not registered with a political party, said the tax bill would both snarl her own taxes and deter potential clients from purchasing homes.

“It’s going to have people move out of the state, if it passes,” Ms. Stout said of the bill. “It makes absolutely no sense.”

Even voters who may support the legislation over all acknowledge that it will come at a cost to the district — and to them personally. Joe Giannotti, a contractor, estimated that he would pay several thousand dollars more in taxes if he lost the deductions that are currently under the knife.

But Mr. Giannotti, who said he usually votes Republican and supports President Trump, said it would be worth it.

“It would hurt this area, but it’s important for the good of the country,” Mr. Giannotti said, arguing that New Jersey Democrats should respond by cutting local taxes: “Let’s get the Democrats to get their policies in line.”

An aide to Mr. Frelinghuysen did not respond to a request for an interview. But Mr. Frelinghuysen, who chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee, has emerged as something of a bellwether figure in New Jersey. Though he is viewed locally as a moderate, Mr. Frelinghuysen has taken a series of perilous votes to back the agenda of Republican leaders, supporting both the tax plan and an unpopular bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Frelinghuysen, who has served in Congress since 1994, is facing his first concerted challenge in years after his district split almost evenly between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump in 2016. Democratic Party polling has found the tax issue to be a potent one in districts like his, with voters inclined to view it as a giveaway to the extremely wealthy, according to a strategist who advises House Democrats and was briefed on the polling.

Mikie Sherrill, a lawyer and former helicopter pilot who has emerged as the most formidable of Mr. Frelinghuysen’s potential Democratic opponents, quickly seized on the tax plan to brand the incumbent as out of touch.

Describing the bill as a “gut punch” to the district, Ms. Sherrill stressed that New Jersey taxpayers would not benefit from the legislation in the same way as people in redder states, where local tax deductions are less valuable.

“I don’t think we are going to feel it here in New Jersey as a tax-cut bill,” she said of the House plan. “Being middle class in New Jersey is a little different from being middle class elsewhere, like Alabama.”

That sense of regional grievance crosses party lines, with both Republicans and Democrats in prosperous coastal areas venting frustration at the possibility that their tax burden may rise as rates fall for corporations and taxpayers in redder states. Mr. Zeldin said that would exacerbate the existing indignity that New Yorkers pay more money in federal taxes than the state gets back from Washington.

Representative Peter T. King of New York, a Republican whose district neighbors Mr. Zeldin’s, said suburban voters would punish Republicans if the current bill becomes law. He said lawmakers had appealed to members of the Trump administration who hail from the area, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, but so far to little avail.

“Maybe it’ll strengthen them in other parts of the country, but it’s going to create very real and justifiable political issues in New York and New Jersey,” Mr. King said of Republican candidates. “You’re talking about restructuring a large part of the economy of the Northeast.”",Tax Plan Burdens Blue-State Republicans and Their Districts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/tax-bill-blue-state.html

And over the last several weeks he has ordered enough high-profile arrests of intellectuals and clerics to frighten the remainder of the academic and religious establishment into acceding to his will as well.

Apolitical scholars who used to speak freely in cafes now look nervously over their shoulders, as Crown Prince Mohammed has achieved a degree of dominance that no ruler has attained for generations.

“It is the coup de grâce of the old system,” said Chas W. Freeman, a former United States ambassador. “Gone. All power has now been concentrated in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman.”

Why the crown prince acted now — whether to eliminate future opposition or perhaps to crush some threat he saw brewing — was not immediately clear.

At 32 years old, he had little experience in government before his father, King Salman, 81, ascended to the throne in 2015, and the prince has demonstrated little patience for the previously staid pace of change in the kingdom.

He has led Saudi Arabia into a protracted military conflict in Yemen and a bitter feud with its Persian Gulf neighbor Qatar. He has taken on a business elite accustomed to state subsidies and profligacy by laying out radical plans to remake the Saudi economy, lessen its dependence on oil and rely instead on foreign investment. And he has squared off against conservatives in the religious establishment with symbolic steps to loosen strict moral codes, including a pending end to the longstanding ban on women driving.

Crown Prince Mohammed’s haste, however, may now come at a price, because the lack of transparency or due process surrounding the anticorruption crackdown is sure to unnerve the same private investors he hopes to attract — including through a planned stock offering of the huge state oil company, Aramco.

Saudi Arabian businessmen and royals anxious about the crown prince’s plans were quietly moving assets out of the country even before the arrests.

“Some of these are businessmen with international status, and if they are caught in this web then it could happen to anyone,” said James M. Dorsey, who studies Saudi Arabia at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “How is that going to inspire confidence and attract foreign investment?”

The Saudi Arabian news media, however, celebrated the arrests as a long-awaited cleanup, appealing to populist resentment of self-enrichment enjoyed by the sprawling royal family and its closest allies.

Almost everyone in the capital, Riyadh, and other big cities like Jidda has heard stories about princes absconding with vast sums that had been allocated for a public project.

The arrests are “a frontal assault on some members of the royal family and the impunity with which they have operated in the past,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University who studies Saudi Arabia.

“It was something that had to be done,” he said, even though the absence of a judicial process “sends a chill down the spine of foreign investors.”

President Trump on Sunday appeared to give a tacit endorsement of the arrests in a phone call with King Salman. A White House summary of the call contained no references to the arrests, and said Mr. Trump had praised Crown Prince Mohammed for other matters.

Three White House advisers, including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, returned just days ago from the latest in at least three high-level Trump administration visits to Saudi Arabia this year.

Nearly 24 hours after the arrests were announced, no Saudi authority or spokesman had identified those arrested or the charges against them.

The Saudi-owned satellite network Al Arabiya reported only that a large number of arrests, including 11 princes, had been ordered by an “anticorruption committee” that just hours earlier had been formed under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed. A royal decree granted the committee powers to detain individuals or seize assets without any trial, process or disclosure.

A list of those arrested began circulating over social media shortly after midnight Sunday, and by Sunday evening senior government officials were reposting the list. News organizations around the region were reporting its contents without contradiction by either the Saudi government or individuals.

In the case of the most politically potent of the detainees, the former security chief Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the Saudi government appeared on Sunday to have started a social media campaign seeking to make him the new face of public corruption.

Analysts said the list appeared to reflect individuals with a reputation for self-enrichment and those representing rival power centers within the kingdom. Others included the power broker who once ran the royal court under King Abdullah, and the owner of one of the biggest private media companies in the region.

But another was a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed himself — Adel Fakeih — who had been considered a driving force behind the ambitious program of economic reform, leaving analysts puzzled about the motives.

In what appeared to be an unrelated episode, a helicopter carrying another Saudi royal, Prince Mansur bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir Province, which borders Yemen, crashed on Sunday, killing the prince along with a number of other officials. Al Arabiya, which reported the crash in a brief dispatch, did not identify the cause.

The history of the House of Saud was sometimes punctuated by violent intrafamily strife in the decades before the founding of the modern dynasty, in 1932. Since then, the family has maintained its unity in part by spreading its top government roles and vast oil wealth among different branches of the sprawling clan. Most important was the division of the three main security services, which constitute the hard power on the ground.

King Salman, however, quickly named his favorite son, Mohammed, as his defense minister, chief of the royal court, a top economic adviser and deputy crown prince. Then, this June, the king removed his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, from his position as crown prince and his powerful role of interior minister in charge of the internal security forces, secret police and counterterrorism operations. Evidently anxious to forestall resistance, the king also placed the demoted nephew under house arrest. A campaign of leaks spread rumors that he had become addicted to painkillers and other drugs.

It was unclear why the crackdown targeted Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is best known for his past and present investments in brand-name Western companies including Twitter, News Corporation, Apple and the Four Seasons. Prince Alwaleed has been a vocal supporter of the crown prince’s plans to attract outside investors to Saudi Arabia. But when a committee of 34 senior family members — known as the allegiance council — approved Prince Mohammed’s elevation to crown prince, one of the three dissenters was from Prince Alwaleed’s branch of the family, the Talals, according to people familiar with the voting.

Michael Stephens, who studies Saudi Arabia at the Royal United Services Institute in London, recalled the bloody purges other leaders in the region have sometimes used to eliminate rivals. What Crown Prince Mohammed was doing, Mr. Stephens said, “is a more genteel way of making sure there are no challenges to your power.”

Time will tell, Mr. Stephens said, whether the arrests signal a slide into despotism or “whether we will look back and say Mohammed bin Salman is the one guy who saw the wall coming and managed to hurdle it.”",Saudi Crown Prince’s Mass Purge Upends a Longstanding System,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/middleeast/saudi-crown-prince-purge.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The Democratic Party, or at least many of its highest-profile figureheads from the last election, is locked in a vicious cycle of re-examinations and recriminations. The latest of those is the controversial new political memoir, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” by Donna Brazile, about serving as acting head of the Democratic National Committee during the last legs of the campaign.

The book is dishy on a personal level but damaging on a political level. Maybe that’s the point. As Joy-Ann Reid wrote on The Daily Beast, “Donna Brazile may be burning the village in order to save it.”

But at a time when Trump is scrambling for anything at all to distract from Mueller’s plodding — and fruitful — investigation, is it the right time to start a three-alarm?

I don’t begrudge anyone the right to tell his or her own story, but my focus now is on protecting the country from Trump, and nothing else.

Brazile contended on ABC’s “This Week” that there would be no truly good time for her to release her book, and that people questioning the timing could “go to hell.” The problem is that we’re already in hell and trying to dig our way out, and many of us are crestfallen when any obstacle is added that might impede that effort.

A Newsweek cover story last week declared, “Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats.” He is a joke on the international stage. He is pushing us closer to an unthinkable nuclear conflict with North Korea. He is inflaming racial tensions by siding with the racists. His Justice Department is chipping away at civil rights. His Environmental Protection Agency is seemingly trying to do everything at odds with protecting the environment. And now Trump and the Republicans want to give the rich a giant wet kiss of a tax break.

The reign of Trump is the reign of ruin. That is why the Resistance is needed now more than ever.

And that’s the good news. The Resistance is strong and resolute, passionate and focused. The historic Women’s March has continued its work with a convention last month in Detroit. Resistance groups like Indivisible have continued their organizing and pressure. Indivisible now boasts that “across the nation, over 5,800 local groups (at least two in every congressional district) are using the Indivisible Guide to hold their members of Congress accountable.” And, as CNN reported on Saturday, there is an overwhelming surge of Democratic women interested in running for office.

More people in polls appear to be waking to the reality that Trump is a walking failure who built his legend and his fortune on the lies that he was savvy and shrewd and a consummate deal maker. They are also waking to the very real possibility that all these Trump campaign contacts with Russians that everyone on the campaign seemed to forget may not be an epidemic of amnesia, but instead a widespread effort to cover something up.

Liberals have the will and determination to turn this giant mistake around, to pressure their elected officials or possibly replace them. They have the resolve to resist Trump by every means at their disposal, while clinging to the hope that he might one day be replaced.

The only issue I see is that these efforts seem to be operating separately from the national Democratic Party, a dinosaur of bureaucratic machinery in an evolved age of direct democratic action.

There are far easier things to do than find an international ape smuggler.

For six months I searched for illicit dealers selling gorillas, orangutans, bonobos or chimps. Thousands have been lost in an underground business that makes millions of dollars off endangered animals and caters to rich pet collectors and unscrupulous zoos. Many apes are traumatized, and even if they are eventually rescued they’re “all goofed up,” in the words of one specialist, having endured serious abuse at the hands of their captors.

I began at the source, motoring hundreds of miles upriver in a precarious, pencil-thin canoe in the Democratic Republic of Congo to an area where many bonobos have disappeared. Then I traveled to Thailand, where some of the biggest wildlife gangs operate. When I finally found an ape trafficker and had him on the phone, I stumbled over what, exactly, to say. All my instincts told me to hammer him with questions like: Where are you getting your apes from? Who are you? But my role was to observe his illicit operation firsthand, which meant not scaring him off. It was a journalistic pickle.

The trafficker introduced himself as “Tom,” clearly a fake name. He had been discovered by Daniel Stiles, a well-known wildlife researcher in Kenya and a source of mine for years. Mr. Stiles had seen Tom’s online advertisements and arranged a deal. The plan was to meet in Bangkok, where Mr. Stiles would give Tom around $15,000 for two endangered baby orangutans, enabling the Thai authorities to swoop in and arrest the smuggler. I would report the events as they unfolded, without getting involved in any exchanges or arrests.

But the plan quickly raised some journalistic questions. Mr. Stiles mentioned to Tom that he might bring a friend named Jeffrey with him to check out the orangutans.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress.","The company attributed its slow pace so far to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.

“We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,” Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. “Speed is the ultimate weapon.”

Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter — considerably short of its target of 1,500.

And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.

While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.

But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.

And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Tesla’s overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.

One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing system — which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats — is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said. “Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.”

Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.

While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla’s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.

The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.

Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3’s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.

“At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.”

Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.

Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance. Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.

But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.

One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory — and he believed he had been fired for it.

“Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,” Mr. Grant said in an email. “That’s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that’s why I handed out fliers.”

The U.A.W. has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.

“I don’t believe I was fired for performance,” said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.

Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.

People tend to do things, like donate organs, when it’s the default option as opposed to something they need to request. They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs. They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms. Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.

But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study. It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication. (Patients’ adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)

Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups. All had recently had heart attacks. One group received the usual care. The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients’ use of medication. Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.

That’s not all. The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didn’t take their pills so that they could receive social support. They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.

This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.

The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.

The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.

Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.

Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.

In some studies, processed red meat in large amounts is associated with an increased relative risk of developing cancer. The absolute risk, however, is often quite small. If I ate an extra serving of bacon a day, every day, my lifetime risk of colon cancer would go up less than one-half of 1 percent. Even then, it’s debatable.

Nevertheless, we’ve become more and more susceptible to arguments that we must avoid certain foods completely. When one panic-du-jour wanes, we find another focus for our fears. We demonized fats. Then cholesterol. Then meat.

For some people in recent years, gluten has become the enemy, even though wheat accounts for about 20 percent of the calories consumed worldwide, more than pretty much any other food. Fewer than 1 percent of people in the United States have a wheat allergy, and fewer than 1 percent have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that requires sufferers to abstain from gluten. Gluten sensitivity (the catchall disorder that leads many Americans to abstain from gluten) is not well defined, and most people who self-diagnose don’t meet the criteria.

Nonetheless, at least one in five Americans regularly chooses gluten-free foods, according to a 2015 poll. Sales of products with gluten-free labels rose to $23 billion worldwide in 2014, up from $11.5 billion worldwide in 2010.

Gluten-free diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B, folate and iron. Compared with regular bagels, gluten-free ones can have a quarter more calories, two and a half times the fat, half the fiber and twice the sugar. They also cost more.

The hullabaloo over gluten echoes the panic over MSG that began roughly half a century ago, and which has yet to fully subside. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is nothing more than a single sodium atom added to glutamic acid — an amino acid that is a key part of the mechanism by which our cells create energy. Without it, all oxygen-dependent life as we know it would die.

A 1968 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine started the frenzy; the writer reported feeling numbness, weakness and palpitations after eating at a Chinese restaurant. A few limited studies followed, along with a spate of news articles. Before long, nutrition experts and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were calling for MSG to be banned. The Food and Drug Administration never had to step in; food companies saw the writing on the wall, and dropped MSG voluntarily.

Many people still wrongly believe that MSG is poison. We certainly don’t need MSG in our diet, but we also don’t need to waste effort avoiding it. Our aversion to it shows how susceptible we are to misinterpreting scientific research and how slow we are to update our thinking when better research becomes available. There’s no evidence that people suffer disproportionately from the afflictions — now ranging from headaches to asthma — that MSG-averse cultures commonly associate with this ingredient. In studies all over the world, the case against MSG just doesn’t hold up.

Too often, we fail to think critically about scientific evidence. Genetically modified organisms are perhaps the best example of this.

G.M.O.s are, in theory, one of our best bets for feeding the planet’s growing population. When a 2015 Pew poll asked Americans whether they thought it was generally safe or unsafe to eat modified foods, almost 60 percent said it was unsafe. The same poll asked scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same question. Only 11 percent of them thought G.M.O.s were unsafe.

Most Americans, at least according to this poll, don’t seem to care what scientists think. In fact, Americans disagree with scientists on this issue more than just about any other, including a host of contentious topics such as vaccines, evolution and even global warming.

If people want to avoid foods, even if there’s no reason to, is that really a problem?

The answer is: yes. Because it makes food scary. And being afraid of food with no real reason is unscientific — part of the dangerous trend of anti-intellectualism that we confront in many places today.

Food should be a cause for pleasure, not panic. For most people, it’s entirely possible to eat more healthfully without living in terror or struggling to avoid certain foods altogether.

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

To be clear, this is still just a plan. There are lots of negotiations to come, and the powerful real estate lobby has already suggested it will fight to retain the mortgage interest deduction, which has been widely decried as wasteful and unfair despite its benefits to homeowners.

Billions of bees are transported to California each year to pollinate almond groves, before moving on to prunes or plums, then cherries, and finally dispersing to crops like melons and blueberries.

But they don’t fly there.

One such highway shipment went awry last week, however, when a tractor-trailer loaded with bees crashed northeast of Sacramento.

The bees were coming from a Montana farm to escape cold weather, and would typically be kept in holding yards for months before being distributed to orchards. The Almond Board of California lists dozens of beekeepers and bee brokers from across the United States that will rent hives.

“It’s a real industrial endeavor now,” said Neal Williams, an associate professor of entomology at University of California, Davis, and the faculty co-director of its Honey and Pollination Center. “There is more money for most beekeepers in pollination compared to honey.”

Bees are vital to almond growers, Mr. Williams said, because the almond nut will not set unless pollen is transferred from one variety to another, which the bees do as they look for nectar. The bees benefit, too, because the crop is the first to bloom, in February or March, after the winter.

“They are going in at a time when they are very hungry,” Mr. Williams said.

Sgt. Tucker Huey of the Auburn Police Department, who responded to the crash scene, said initial hesitation to work among buzzing bees was unfounded.

“Some of the boxes broke and some of the lids came off during the crash,” Sergeant Huey said. “A lot of bees were free and flying around. They weren’t swarming too bad because it was dark and cool.”

The police and fire departments killed the bees with soapy water, Sergeant Huey said, on the recommendation of beekeepers who said the cargo could not be salvaged. Two people were stung, once each. He was spared.

“We learn our deepest ways of intimacy with mother,” she wrote. “Automatically we repeat the pattern” — taking the role of either mother or child — “with everyone else with whom we become close.”

Kirkus Reviews called the book ”a stimulating convergence of personal and cultural inquiry.” It remained on the New York Times best-seller list for over a year.

Ms. Friday dealt with other subjects, as the author of “Jealousy” (1985), “The Power of Beauty” (1996) and even a work of fiction, “Lulu: A Novella” (2012). But fantasy was her specialty, and the subject of four more of her books, including “Women on Top: How Real Life Has Changed Women’s Sexual Fantasies” (1991) and “Men in Love: Men’s Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love Over Rage” (1980).

Discussing ""Men in Love” in 1980, she told People magazine: “The major theme in men’s sexual fantasies is the sexually aroused woman. It’s still hard for most men to believe that women enjoy sex.”

Ms. Friday became a frequent guest on television talk shows, called on to discuss almost any issue that particularly affected women. She often took the unfashionable side of an argument.

On the late-night show “Tomorrow” in 1981, she and the host, Tom Snyder, flirted as they discussed the topic of sexual initiative.

“I think men are very much waiting for women to take the initiative,” Ms. Friday said with a smile. A minute or two later, she acknowledged, “We can’t really develop further in terms of sexual equality or whatever until men have adapted to our changes.” When Mr. Snyder asked for advice on adapting, she laughed and answered, “Well, honey, you could work on it!”

Fifteen years later, appearing on Bill Maher’s Comedy Central talk show “Politically Incorrect” to discuss sexual harassment in the office, she minimized the phenomenon’s seriousness (“The workplace is the meeting and mating place”) and contended that men were equal victims of harassment and even of domestic violence. Mr. Maher pronounced her “out of your mind if you think that’s a problem” and challenged her to elaborate.

“Women are tough,” Ms. Friday replied. “Women are rough. And we’ve been angry for a long, long time.”

Nancy Colbert Friday was born on Aug. 27, 1933, in Pittsburgh to Walter Friday and the former Jane Colbert. Some biographical references say that her father died when she was 2; others report that her parents divorced.

In any case, Nancy, her older sister and their mother soon moved to Charleston, S.C., where Nancy attended Ashley Hall, the prestigious girls’ prep school. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1955 and moved to Puerto Rico, where she worked as a travel reporter and editor.

In the 1960s she moved to New York. A 1995 Esquire article looked back on her life at that time: She took a job in public relations, the article said, that allowed her to “dance at the hippest discos and sleep with drunken poets” before meeting her first husband, the columnist and author Bill Manville.

Ms. Friday talked about preferring the company of men to that of women and seemed to take pride in a Ms. magazine review of one of her books, which included the observation “This woman is not a feminist.” In a 1996 interview with Salon, she said, “I would no more go to a consciousness-raising group and talk about my intimate life with my husband than fly to the moon.”

She and Mr. Manville, who were married in 1967, were living in London when she began working on “My Secret Garden.” They divorced in the mid-1980s. In 1988 she married Norman Pearlstine, then the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, in a boldface-names ceremony at the Rainbow Room (the best man was the film producer and director James L. Brooks; Donald Trump was a guest). The Pearlstines divorced in 2005.

Ms. Friday leaves no immediate survivors.

She told The Times in 1977 that she had made a deliberate decision not to have children. “It isn’t something that every woman automatically does well,” she observed. “Besides, I still have these anxieties and doubts, and I don’t want to pass that on to another generation.”","Nancy Friday, 84, Best-Selling Student of Gender Politics, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/obituaries/nancy-friday-84-best-selling-student-of-gender-politics-dies.html

commissioner until Mr. Trump nominates someone to take the job for a full five-year term.","Mr. Koskinen was already enjoying retirement in 2013 when the Obama administration asked him to take the helm of the I.R.S. during a crisis fueled by allegations that it had wrongfully scrutinized Tea Party groups that had applied for tax-exempt status. He was known as a Mr. Fix-It in Washington for his work at the Office of Management and Budget during the 1990s government shutdown, for heading the team that averted the Y2K crisis at the turn of the century and for leading Freddie Mac during the financial crisis. The I.R.S. was a challenge he could not refuse.

Four years later, Mr. Koskinen has weathered a fusillade of attacks. Threatened with censure and impeachment on the grounds that he was misleading Congress about the actions of his predecessors, the commissioner refused to be pushed out of the job.

“Not a chance,” Mr. Koskinen said when asked if he ever considered quitting.

His wry sense of humor remains intact. In his waning time, he jokes with his staff about all the “fun” of their daily tasks and counts down the days to his departure by tending to a makeshift pumpkin patch decorated with gourds bearing his likeness. Soon enough, Mr. Koskinen jokes as he distributes candy to a visitor, he will turn into a pumpkin and disappear.

Mr. Koskinen is spending his remaining days defending his agency’s integrity and drumming up funding for a department that has been running on dwindling resources. Mr. Koskinen took some solace in an inspector general report released last month that showed the I.R.S. had actually been scrutinizing both liberal and conservative groups, yet he remains concerned that the coarse treatment he received from members of Congress could discourage future public servants from taking such jobs.

“I do think it’s corrosive,” said Mr. Koskinen, who compared the I.R.S. targeting scandal to the furor over the attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, that led to investigations and congressional hearings. “When you have an issue that resonates, you don’t want that issue to go away.”

Earlier this year, Republicans were hopeful that Mr. Trump’s arrival would finally secure Mr. Koskinen’s dismissal. However, Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Trump have a good rapport, and the president took no action to remove him.

In fact, the two men have a long history together. In 1975, when Mr. Koskinen worked at the Palmieri Company, an asset management firm, he negotiated a deal with Mr. Trump over the sale of the Commodore Hotel in New York City from the bankrupt Penn Central Transportation Company.

The deal marked the beginning of Mr. Trump’s foray into the Manhattan property market, and Mr. Koskinen recalled haggling with him for months over the details of the transaction. He even offered Mr. Trump advice, counseling him not to broadcast that he was just 29 years old when he was casting about for a $70 million loan.

“He was irrepressible, energetic and fun to deal with,” Mr. Koskinen said.

While he has not spoken to Mr. Trump since they touched base before the inauguration, these days one of Mr. Koskinen’s top priorities has been protecting Mr. Trump’s tax returns. The president has refused to release his returns, and the documents have become the most sought-after leak in a capital that has never been so porous.

On the occasions that portions of Mr. Trump’s returns have trickled out into the public domain in the past year, Mr. Koskinen was relieved when he learned that it was not the fault of the I.R.S., which by law must keep taxpayers’ returns private.

“I told people to check what our process was and do whatever we could to isolate the returns,” Mr. Koskinen said. “We’ve had people offering bounties and people offering millions of dollars for them.”

Hard copies of Mr. Trump’s tax returns are kept in a locked cabinet in a special office at the I.R.S. headquarters. Mr. Koskinen said the cabinet would eventually be replaced with a safe.

With hackers rampant, Mr. Trump’s returns are not the only ones Mr. Koskinen is worried about. He said the agency gets more than a million “pings” per day from cyberattackers trying to gain access to taxpayer data, and he warned that budget cuts could make it difficult to safeguard the system.

Mr. Koskinen, who is a Democrat, said he hoped that the tension between Congress and the agency would abate once the Trump administration installed a successor.

Last month, the Treasury Department announced that David Kautter, its assistant secretary for tax policy, would serve as interim I.R.S. commissioner until Mr. Trump nominates someone to take the job for a full five-year term.

As for his own plans, Mr. Koskinen, who has a physics degree from Duke and a law degree from Yale, is keeping his options open. One possibility is that he will give retirement another try for a while.

“The plan,” he said, “is to not answer the phone.”","I.R.S. Commissioner, Demonized by Conservatives, Leaves on His Terms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/john-koskinen-irs-commissioner-steps-down.html

Now the I.O.C. and Russian officials are engaged in a doping stare down. Many athletes, antidoping officials and Olympics officials from some countries are urging Thomas Bach, president of the I.O.C., to issue severe penalties.

The top Olympic officials are also considering the option of having Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag at the Pyeongchang Games or wear neutral uniforms, according to the people familiar with the case. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The I.O.C. is unlikely to impose a total ban on Russia, an Olympic heavyweight, though it could issue a significant financial penalty, expel athletes and officials found to have been part of the doping scheme and remove any mention of Russia from the field of play, according to the people.

Russian officials have threatened to pull their athletes out of the Pyeongchang Games altogether if the sanctions are too harsh.

A decision is expected to be made on Dec. 5, when the I.O.C’s executive board meets. Before then the officials will receive the results of a much-delayed study by the former Swiss president Samuel Schmid into McLaren’s report, which linked several state organs, including the intelligence agency FSB, to the doping conspiracy.

A group of 17 national antidoping agencies published a letter in September demanding that Russia be excluded from the Pyeongchang Games.

“The failure to expeditiously investigate individual Russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 Winter Games,” said the letter, whose signatories included the United States and British antidoping agencies.

Russia is expected to react with fury, and even withdraw its team from the Winter Games, if the I.O.C. issues a severe punishment. The Pyeongchang Olympics are scheduled to take place about six weeks before President Vladimir Putin stands for re-election.

“The position is unequivocal for all — Russians will not compete under the neutral flag at the Olympic Games,” Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russia’s Olympic committee, said in comments published on the Russian website R-Sport. “They will speak for their country. This option is not even being considered.”

The late rush to settle on a punishment is a repeat of events ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Then, in the wake of Dr. Rodchenkov’s revelations, the I.O.C ordered individual sports federations to determine the eligibility of Russian athletes for those Games. Some, like cycling, rowing and track and field, adopted blanket bans, while others admitted athletes who could prove they were clean.

Last week at a meeting of the 205 eligible Olympic nations and territories, Bach said that any manipulation of samples at Sochi would constitute a “direct attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on the I.O.C.” But since the start of the crisis he has emphasized his opposition to “collective punishment,” preferring that each athlete have a chance to establish his innocence.

Bach has forcefully pushed back at calls for the I.O.C. to act more swiftly against Russia. He has said that punishments cannot be determined before the I.O.C.’s inquiries had been completed. The I.O.C. also commissioned an investigation by the head of its disciplinary commission, Denis Oswald, into possible doping violations by individual athletes at the Sochi, London and Beijing Games.

“In the Olympic movement everybody — when we say everybody it is everybody — everybody enjoys the same rights and obligations and everyone enjoys the right to a fair and due procedure,’’ Bach said. “I call all of you to respect this fair procedure for all our colleagues, because we always think how you would react if you were accused of some wrongdoings and what you would expect from your colleagues.”

No winter sports federation has publicly supported a total ban of Russian athletes at the Pyeongchang Games.

Last week the I.O.C penalized the first two athletes following Oswald’s investigation. The Russian cross country skiers Alexander Legkov and Evgeniy Belov were banned for life for doping violations at the Sochi Games.

Dr. Rodchenkov said Russia tampered with urine samples that would have failed drug tests in Sochi. Oswald’s commission has taken longer than first anticipated to reach verdicts after it struggled to come up with a suitable method of detecting whether bottles — previously considered tamper-proof — had been manipulated.

McLaren’s report captured the scale and audaciousness of Russia’s doping program, using forensic analysis to corroborate the testimony of Dr. Rodchenkov. The report said the drug tests of about 1,000 athletes — across several Olympics — were corrupted, but acknowledged that proving wrongdoing for individual cases would be difficult given Russia’s lack of cooperation in providing lab data and its history of destroying tainted urine samples that would be plainly incriminating.

The World Anti-Doping Agency has cleared 95 of the first 96 athletes whose cases of doping in competitions have been reviewed.

The agency in 2015 declared Russia noncompliant with global sports’ accepted antidoping code. Among several requirements for regaining compliance, the agency said, Russian antidoping authorities must publicly accept the findings in McLaren’s report and the Russian government must provide access to the stored urine samples in the Moscow laboratory.

Russia has not fulfilled either of those demands yet. Russian officials have cited an ongoing FSB investigation for refusing WADA access to lab samples and data.

Any form of carbon pricing has become taboo in Australia — particularly in Mr. Turnbull’s conservative Liberal Party — even though such a market-based approach is the most efficient, cheapest way of reducing emissions. Last week, a report from Australia’s Productivity Commission reiterated this point, declaring Australia must “adopt a proper vehicle for reducing carbon emissions that puts a single effective price on carbon.”

Instead, Australians have contorted ourselves to look like we’re responding to climate change without really doing so. We’ve paid some companies taxpayer dollars to reduce their emissions, while imposing no penalties on those who don’t. We’ve legislated a “renewable energy target,” then announced it was under review, then finally reduced it. While we reviewed, we watched investments in large-scale renewables drop an astonishing 90 percent in a year.

As a target was settled, investment recovered. But, even then, because there was no carbon price — charges for those who emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — to make investments in renewable energy more commercially attractive, energy retailers weren’t giving investors the long-term contracts they needed to get bank loans. This naturally makes investment a shorter-term affair, limiting its scope and ambition. It also means that investments in renewable energy weren’t being directly connected to the retail market.

With the lost years and disconnections between investors and retailers, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that whatever renewables investment Australia now has, it should have had more. Meanwhile, Australia hasn’t even enjoyed the short-term financial benefits of repealing the carbon tax, which was demonized for making electricity unaffordable. As a result, Australia now has the most expensive energy prices in the world, and a power supply so unreliable that summer blackouts are now a real possibility.

There are many reasons for this, including an underdeveloped renewable energy grid and coal-fired power stations on which Australia has for so long relied that are nearing the end of their operating lives.

Enter the Turnbull government’s National Energy Guarantee. Perhaps its most fundamental change is that it addresses energy retailers, rather than generators. It’s a useful idea, ensuring that energy investments have a home in the consumer market.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The policy plan makes two fundamental requirements of the retail companies that sell energy to consumers. First, retailers have to meet a quota for reliable energy — “dispatchable” energy that can be made available immediately. This seeks to minimize the chance of blackouts, which the government has argued are at least partly a function of how renewable energies like solar and wind can fluctuate with weather unless effectively stored. This may be read as a way of giving an advantage to coal, though that seems less likely as storage of renewables increases.

Second, there is a limit on the amount of emissions intensity that will require retailers to purchase “clean energy” from energy generators. It’s a proposal that manages to obey the current laws of Australian politics. There’s no carbon price, no taxes and no explicit focus on renewable energy. The reliable energy quota is deliberately agnostic on the sources of energy, thereby making it a blank political canvas. If you really believe coal is the future, the quota can accommodate that. Same if you think renewables are becoming cheaper and more reliable every year. The policy plan holds at least the potential for broad support, which is something Australia has never achieved.

But that’s only possible because, for the moment, it’s largely content-free. Just about everything depends on what the relevant reliable energy quotas will be, but no one yet knows. Will they be set low and then increased? If so, how quickly? What relationship will they bear to Australia’s commitments under the Paris climate accord? Will they shift the emissions burden to the electricity sector, or will they require other sectors to make disproportionate reductions? And precisely how severe will the penalties be for retailers that fail to meet these targets?

These are not mere policy details. They are the essence of the political differences that remain on climate change.

That this is the best we can do — indeed that this is a relative triumph for Mr. Turnbull — illustrates just how tangled Australia’s climate politics have become. The country has taken a long, hard look at every warning about the costs of delayed climate action and ignored them all. And, subsequently, it has paid for those costs through high energy prices and curtailed investment.

At last, having long understood that a carbon price would be the most efficient solution, we’ve opted for what is a fairly blunt form of regulation. It’s where nobody would have recommended we be a decade ago, and it is not ideal. But it is something. And if we can find a way to work with it, perhaps the next decade will be better than the one before.",Australia Has a Climate Change Lesson for the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/australia-climate-change.html

“This is easy-ish for me because you’re a reporter; I’m the interviewee,” he said when we’d been talking awhile. “We have specific roles. If we met on the street, that would be more scary.”

That’s how he’s felt about performing, too, ever since he was little: perfectly comfortable as long as he knows the part he’s meant to play.

Casting Mr. Rowe was the result of a deliberate effort by two professional regional theaters, Syracuse Stage and its co-producer, Indiana Repertory Theater (where the show opened this fall), to audition actors both with and without autism for the role. At a time when theaters are discussing diversity, there is a heightened pressure to include performers with disabilities. “Uncommon Sense,” Tectonic Theater Project’s new Off Broadway play about people with autism and their families, has an actor on the spectrum, Andrew Duff, in its ensemble.

Robert Hupp, the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, said that seeking out actors on the spectrum “made logical and irrefutable sense” for “Curious Incident.” To him, Mr. Rowe’s performance is clear validation.

“To anyone who ever had any concerns or doubts or wondered, ‘Could an actor with autism play this role? Would an actor who falls on the spectrum be overwhelmed by this production?’ the answer is definitively no,” he said. “Not if you’re Mickey Rowe.”

Mr. Rowe, who earned a bachelor’s degree in drama from the University of Washington, found out when he was a senior there that he had autism. Legally blind, he struggles to read print smaller than 18-point type (he wears contacts onstage and glasses “in real life,” he says), and was in special education classes for his vision throughout childhood — years he spent friendless, obsessed with magic tricks and circus skills: stilt-walking, juggling, unicycling.

It strikes him as telling that he got speech and occupational therapy, too. He suspects his parents knew he had autism but didn’t want to label him, and if so, he understands. He hasn’t asked them, though; he said they don’t have that kind of relationship.

At the suggestion of his girlfriend — now his wife and the mother of their two small children — he sought help with issues like interpreting social cues. At the university’s Adult Autism Clinic, his diagnosis came as “a big relief, because you know your whole life that something is different,” Mr. Rowe said. “You don’t know why or what it is or if you’re stupid or what’s going on.”

Still, he didn’t tell people about his autism. So it was unsettling when, in an acting class he took around the time “Curious Incident” opened on Broadway in 2014, the teacher handed him one of Christopher’s speeches and said, “You need to do this monologue. This is you.”

“I remember thinking to myself afterwards: Does she know I’m on the spectrum?” Mr. Rowe said. “Like, do people just know?”

He is not Christopher, though, and he and Christopher occupy very different spots on the spectrum. Even so, he recognized enough pieces of himself in that monologue that he went home and listened to the novel, by Mark Haddon, that Mr. Stephens adapted into the play.

Not long afterward, struggling to get work, Mr. Rowe threw in the towel on trying to pass as neurotypical. In an essay on the theater industry website HowlRound, he wrote about being an actor with autism, noting the “tension between everything that I am and everything that might be conventional for an actor.” He hoped his disclosure would change the way people looked at him, just enough to give him a chance.

The piece raised his profile and put him on the radar of anyone searching for an actor with autism, but in practice nothing changed. Going out for roles, he still faced immediate roadblocks: the small talk, the eye contact, the instant connection an actor is supposed to make with the director.

“Just how you walk into the room and shake hands with the person when you first meet them is a huge part of the audition, and people on the spectrum aren’t very good at that,” he said.

So his résumé was comparatively slender when the Indiana/Syracuse production asked him to submit a video audition. Soon the show’s California-based director, Risa Brainin, flew to Seattle to see if he had the chops. If he didn’t, they weren’t going to compromise.

“We couldn’t,” she said. “It’s too major of a role, and too difficult of a role. What we wanted to do was give the opportunity.”

In Syracuse, where the production runs through Nov. 12, Mr. Rowe plays Christopher with an agile grace, an impish humor and a humanizing restraint that seems directly connected to his experience of autism. When the stage directions say that Christopher barks like a dog, for example, Mr. Rowe chooses to underplay it.

The attention the show has gotten has been positive for him. For one thing, Lincoln Center asked him to speak at its autism-focused Big Umbrella Festival next spring. And the ripples extend farther. Marissa Wolf, who is directing “Curious Incident” this winter at Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, said Mr. Rowe’s casting inspired her to choose an actor with Tourette’s syndrome, a condition often associated with autism spectrum disorder, to play Christopher in her production.

Mr. Rowe worries a little about being pigeonholed, because he also wants to play roles that have nothing to do with autism. At the same time, he sees characters in the canon who he thinks could be on the spectrum — like Bobby, the young misfit in David Mamet’s “American Buffalo,” and Jason, the awkward adolescent in David Lindsay-Abaire’s “Rabbit Hole.”

Eager to work with Mr. Rowe again, Mr. Hupp and Ms. Brainin have been scheming about future projects, pondering which roles — maybe something in Shakespeare? — would be a great fit for him.

What Mr. Rowe wants is a life in the American theater, probably with a stint in graduate school on the way. He can envision himself as the leader of a regional theater, and he is undaunted by the socializing that would require. Mingling may not be in his skill set, but to him, an artistic director is simply playing a role. And knowing that takes the fear away.","The World Really Is a Stage, Scripts and All, to Actor With Autism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/theater/actor-with-autism-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time.html

The apartment, unit No. 2301, was first listed for sale in 2014, seven years after Mr. Pavarotti’s death. The price was $13.7 million. It was taken off the market and re-listed in early 2016 for $10.5 million, then later that year offered briefly as a potential combination with a smaller, neighboring apartment, No. 2302, for a total of $20.5 million. Last month’s sale was without a broker.

Mr. Pavarotti had purchased this 2,000-square-foot apartment, with two bedrooms and two baths, more than 30 years ago. His wife said he was drawn, in part, to the apartment’s proximity to the Metropolitan Opera House. It is also close to Carnegie Hall.

THE PENTHOUSE SOLD BY MR. NEWHOUSE is at 105 East 29th Street, a co-op building near Park Avenue South. It closed at $6.8 million, which was not far from the asking price.

This 2,458-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, along with two wraparound terraces totaling 705 square feet, according to the Douglas Elliman listing.

In Greenwich Village, Ms. Errico, who has starred in several Broadway shows, and Mr. McEnroe, who is a brother of the tennis champion John McEnroe, sold their five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath duplex at 250 Mercer Street for $5.2 million. The 3,883-square-foot apartment also came with a storage unit.

And in the West Village, Ms. Poehler paid $6.5 million to Mr. Arnett, from whom she is divorced, for their eighth-floor apartment at 1 Morton Square. The 2,446-square-foot unit has three bedrooms and three baths.

Some wrote just to say thanks. From Arizona, from all over the country and from abroad. From all across the political map, too. Some wrote to say that they watched the speech with their children, or that they read it aloud to them. “I try to teach my kids to respect others,” wrote one man. “The current resident of the White House is not the example I want my kids to follow.”

“As a die-hard Democrat, I have to say that before Trump came into office, you were kinda low on my list of senators to admire,” one woman wrote. “But I have changed that stance.” Another man wrote, “I am a registered Republican, but I am ashamed of what my party has become.”

One woman from Phoenix said she didn’t like my politics but thanked me for the “small beacon of light” all the same. “Semper Fi,” wrote a Marine. One man sent a check for $20.20 and urged me to run for president. (Sir, I will not be cashing the check, but I do appreciate the gesture.)

Each letter is distinctive, but all are plaintive, anguished, deeply engaged and urgent. They all have in common a feeling of distress that the country has taken a sudden and caustic turn, that we have a president who seems to take pleasure in dividing us. A president who is careless with the position that has become known in the past century as “leader of the free world,” and that our institutions and maybe even our liberty are in peril as a consequence. Please, the letter writers all said. Don’t stop speaking out. I’M COUNTING ON IT, one person wrote.

Those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks, as filing and fund-raising deadlines for next year’s election approach. Just how high could depend on the success or failure of Republicans’ latest legislative push, an ambitious rewrite of the federal tax code that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has pledged to get through the chamber in a matter of weeks. Should the effort fail, current and former lawmakers said, the number of demoralized Republicans leaving the chamber could jump.

“Each of us will have our own individual stories, but the promise of unified government is much more difficult, cumbersome and elusive than we ever thought it would be,” said Mr. Chaffetz, 50, who stepped down in June to take a job at Fox News. “You have people who are frustrated they can’t get their legislation to the finish line.”

Republican campaign strategists and congressional aides said they were watching at least two other committee chairmen facing term limits for potential retirements: Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, who is the chairman of the Transportation Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Smith, a long-serving conservative and former Judiciary Committee chairman, said the decision to retire was largely personal. He wrote on Thursday that with his chairmanship ending and a new grandchild arriving, the time felt right to step aside after 16 terms.

“It is humbling living in a small apartment in Washington four nights a week,” he wrote. “And I seldom leave the office before late at night.”

Mr. Smith took over the science panel in 2013 and turned it into a powerful counterweight to Obama administration environmental policy. He subpoenaed scientists, accused federal agencies working on climate change of engaging in scientific fraud and supported stripping NASA of much of its climate change research. News of his departure has been as polarizing as his chairmanship.

Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, and a leading contrarian of the scientific consensus on global warming, said Mr. Smith’s retirement was a “huge loss to the science community.”

Scientists who have clashed with him, though, said they were hopeful that his departure would mark a return to a less adversarial body.

“Chairman Smith misused his position to subpoena federal researchers, sow doubt about scientific facts and push bills that would undermine the role of science in policy,” said Andrew Rosenberg, the director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“I hope that the next representative to serve as chair will return this committee to its intended purpose: strengthening America’s scientific enterprise, providing thoughtful and constructive oversight of federal policy and protecting the health and safety of the people Congress is supposed to serve,” he said.

Mr. Hensarling, 60, cut a less divisive but still influential figure on Capitol Hill. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hensarling was one of the House’s leading lieutenants in the Republican fight to scale back the government’s role in regulating the economy. In June, the House passed Mr. Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, which would dismantle many of the Obama-era banking regulations codified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

He also broke with big business in his crusade to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, the government agency that guarantees loans for the overseas customers of American exporters. That effort put him at odds with many members of his party, even on his committee.

The push has so far failed, but the agency’s largest transactions have been crippled for nearly two and a half years by conservative actions on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Hensarling, who has been in the House since 2003, wrote in a letter explaining his decision on Tuesday that he had already stayed longer in Washington than he had intended and the end of his chairmanship provided a natural break. And given his position, he will be a strong candidate for a lucrative next act in the private sector.

But his work in Washington was marked by frustration, as well. A sign of how difficult it has been to see legislation into law: His Financial Choice Act stands a slim chance of passing the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority.

Dick Armey, a former House majority leader under Mr. Gingrich and a fellow Texan, said Mr. Hensarling’s departure struck him as premature and a casualty of the sort that Republicans had brought upon themselves.

“I have no doubt he’s frustrated,” Mr. Armey said. “You can’t be as able and as innovative a guy as Jeb is without being frustrated right now.”

Others drew different lessons.

The Window Air-Conditioner: Should It Stay or Go? Image With storage space scarce, New Yorkers often leave their air conditioners in their windows through the winter. Credit Richard Levine/Alamy Stock Photo

Few appliances are as unwieldy and unsightly as a window air-conditioner. Install it in a window in June and its rattling hum delivers a daily reminder that come fall, you will want it out — a task that would be a headache even without the palpable fear that the thing could tumble out the window onto the sidewalk below.

Hence, the New Yorker’s dilemma: resign yourself to living with an unsightly object year-round or go to the trouble of removing it?

WHEN TO LEAVE AN AIR-CONDITIONER IN THE WINDOW

Window units pose two main problems: They diminish natural light and cause a draft.

In some cases, the downside is tolerable. If you’re fortunate enough to have more than one window in the room, you might be willing to tolerate the diminished light. Or if your apartment feels like a balmy August afternoon in the middle of January, you might like the draft.

“Some people leave their A/Cs in all year long because their buildings are warm,” said Steven W. Birbach, the president of Vanderbilt Property Management . “If that’s what they want to do, that’s O.K. with us.”

If you plan to keep your window unit in place, wrap the inside of the unit with a padded cover to reduce draft and insulate the area around it. Another option: Cover the entire window in plastic sheeting.

WHEN (AND HOW) TO TAKE IT OUT

If your apartment gets drafty or your light is limited, you probably want the air-conditioner out. But before you enlist a friend to help, remember that should anything go awry, you will be liable.

“All it takes is one air-conditioner dropping out the window and killing someone,” said Ellen Kornfeld, the vice president of the Lovett Group , which manages residential properties in New York.

Instead, ask a professional. Your superintendent or other building staff may do the job, although some buildings do not permit staff to handle air-conditioners. Since people take their units out anytime from Labor Day to Thanksgiving, you should not have too much trouble finding time in the super’s schedule to get the work done.

Just be prepared to pay, since it might be considered an off-the-clock job. “Lots of people will give the super $20 or $100 and have him do it, which is generally fine,” said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft , a Manhattan property management company.

Find out if you can store the unit in the basement. If not, be prepared to sacrifice the bottom of a closet to the appliance — or, worse, to pretend that the hulking object on the floor is an end table.

Some New York City companies, like CoolAir in Queens and Air-Wave in the Bronx, will store your air-conditioners in their warehouses. Both companies charge about $279 to remove, clean, store and then reinstall an air-conditioner.

REINSTALLING IN THE SPRING

Come spring, you will have to put the dreaded thing back in place, unless you want to swelter all summer long. Make sure whoever does the work follows city installation rules designed to prevent air-conditioners from falling out of windows.

Q. I am about to close on a house in New Canaan, Conn., and my move-in date is flexible. What tasks are best done while the house is still vacant?

A. Buy a house, and finishing the to-do list can take months — or even years. While many chores happen in bits and pieces over the time that you live in your home, a few essential tasks should be done right away. Dispense with the disruptive ones before the moving truck arrives, and you will thank yourself later.

So, where to start? Look no further than the front door, and change the locks. By now, the previous owner’s friends, neighbors and brokers may have copies of the keys. So make new ones. If you plan to install a home security system, do so before your valuables arrive. Get a certificate of installation from your security company to send it to your homeowner insurance carrier so you can get a discount on your policy.

Schedule an appointment with your internet, television and telephone providers to wire your home for service before you arrive. “Nowadays, if people don’t have a Wi-Fi network installed, it’s hard to even function,” said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with Halstead in New Canaan.

Next, hire a housekeeping service to give the house a deep clean. Make sure the package includes details like cleaning the inside of light fixtures, windows, closets and cupboards, the basement and the attic. “Do it once, and do it right,” Mr. Sneddon said. Get the ductwork, heating and cooling systems serviced.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The Democratic Party, or at least many of its highest-profile figureheads from the last election, is locked in a vicious cycle of re-examinations and recriminations. The latest of those is the controversial new political memoir, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” by Donna Brazile, about serving as acting head of the Democratic National Committee during the last legs of the campaign.

The book is dishy on a personal level but damaging on a political level. Maybe that’s the point. As Joy-Ann Reid wrote on The Daily Beast, “Donna Brazile may be burning the village in order to save it.”

But at a time when Trump is scrambling for anything at all to distract from Mueller’s plodding — and fruitful — investigation, is it the right time to start a three-alarm?

I don’t begrudge anyone the right to tell his or her own story, but my focus now is on protecting the country from Trump, and nothing else.

Brazile contended on ABC’s “This Week” that there would be no truly good time for her to release her book, and that people questioning the timing could “go to hell.” The problem is that we’re already in hell and trying to dig our way out, and many of us are crestfallen when any obstacle is added that might impede that effort.

A Newsweek cover story last week declared, “Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats.” He is a joke on the international stage. He is pushing us closer to an unthinkable nuclear conflict with North Korea. He is inflaming racial tensions by siding with the racists. His Justice Department is chipping away at civil rights. His Environmental Protection Agency is seemingly trying to do everything at odds with protecting the environment. And now Trump and the Republicans want to give the rich a giant wet kiss of a tax break.

The reign of Trump is the reign of ruin. That is why the Resistance is needed now more than ever.

And that’s the good news. The Resistance is strong and resolute, passionate and focused. The historic Women’s March has continued its work with a convention last month in Detroit. Resistance groups like Indivisible have continued their organizing and pressure. Indivisible now boasts that “across the nation, over 5,800 local groups (at least two in every congressional district) are using the Indivisible Guide to hold their members of Congress accountable.” And, as CNN reported on Saturday, there is an overwhelming surge of Democratic women interested in running for office.

More people in polls appear to be waking to the reality that Trump is a walking failure who built his legend and his fortune on the lies that he was savvy and shrewd and a consummate deal maker. They are also waking to the very real possibility that all these Trump campaign contacts with Russians that everyone on the campaign seemed to forget may not be an epidemic of amnesia, but instead a widespread effort to cover something up.

Liberals have the will and determination to turn this giant mistake around, to pressure their elected officials or possibly replace them. They have the resolve to resist Trump by every means at their disposal, while clinging to the hope that he might one day be replaced.

The only issue I see is that these efforts seem to be operating separately from the national Democratic Party, a dinosaur of bureaucratic machinery in an evolved age of direct democratic action.

Before midday, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko welcomed Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, at the Imperial residence. Afterward, the president was formally received by Mr. Abe on a red carpet at Akasaka Palace, a neo-Baroque building that resembles Buckingham Palace. The two men inspected an honor guard, glittering in gold braid, their rifles fixed with bayonets.

Earlier, however, Mr. Trump used a breakfast meeting of Japanese and American business executives to deliver a scathing critique of the trade relationship between the two countries. Japan, he said, bought virtually no cars from the United States while exporting millions of vehicles into the American market.

“Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over,” Mr. Trump said, disregarding the fact that Japanese carmakers have built huge assembly plants in the United States. “That’s not too much to ask,” he continued. “Is that rude to ask?”

In somewhat gentler terms, Mr. Trump told Mr. Abe that the United States was seeking a new kind of trade relationship. Though he praised the Japanese economy, the president added, “I don’t know if it’s as good as ours. I think not, O.K.?” he said, shooting Mr. Abe a gimlet-eyed glance. “And we’re going to try to keep it that way, and you’ll be second.”

Still, Mr. Trump also showed a keen appreciation of the domestic politics of his host. At Mr. Abe’s behest, the president met with the families of Japanese people kidnapped by North Korea, an issue that has deep political resonance among Japanese.

At the news conference, Mr. Trump likened the plight of these families to that of the family of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and died a few days after being returned to the United States in a coma-like state.

Whether by design or otherwise, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly rejected the idea of direct negotiations with North Korea over curbing its nuclear program, seemed to suggest his stance could change if Mr. Kim returned the Japanese people his regime had abducted. North Korea has said that most of the abductees are dead.

“Now the spotlight is on, and perhaps we could have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong-un would send them back. If he would send them back that would be the start of something — I think it would be just something very special if they would do that.”

Mr. Abe, for his part, played to his guest’s appetite for ceremony — and spontaneity. As the two leaders strolled to lunch in a private dining room overlooking a koi pond, they were each given a wooden box of fish food and a spoon. After a few moments of delicately spooning the flakes into the pond, a restless Mr. Abe tossed in the remains of his box, leading Mr. Trump to dump his, too.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe then took seats at a long, low table on a floor covered with straw tatami mats. At the news conference, the prime minister referred repeatedly to Mr. Trump by his first name, Donald, recounting their meetings at Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, the president’s Florida estate, and a dinner here on Sunday so enjoyable that he said they lost track of time.

“How many hours of dialogue have we had?” Mr. Abe asked. “I believe there have been never been such close bonds.”

Mr. Abe reacted mildly to reports in the Japanese media — which Mr. Trump implicitly confirmed during the news conference — that Mr. Trump was dismayed by Japan’s decision not to shoot down missiles North Korea fired over Japanese territory in August and September. The missiles flew over the island of Hokkaido before landing harmlessly in the sea.

In conversations with other Asian leaders, a senior American official said, Mr. Trump asked why a country of “samurai warriors” did not shoot down the missiles, which the North Koreans launched in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Mr. Trump did not directly address the issue on Monday, though he noted that over the weekend an American antimissile system had shot down a missile fired on Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Japan had tracked the missiles North Korea fired over Japan, Mr. Abe said, and would have shot them down if they had posed a threat to Japanese citizens.

Japan’s American-made missile defense systems would have enabled it to shoot down the missile that flew over Hokkaido on Aug. 29, though not a subsequent one tested on Sept. 15. It is also possible Japan could have missed if it tried to shoot the missiles down, which would have been an acute embarrassment.

Legally, the question is even more complicated. Japan can only intercept a missile if its citizens are in danger or if there is an attack on an allied country that could jeopardize Japan’s security, said Noboru Yamaguchi, professor of international relations at the International University of Japan in Niigata.

Since North Korea has so far only conducted missile tests — as opposed to launching missiles armed with live warheads — Japan does not have the legal right to intercept them. Moreover, said Mr. Yamaguchi who is a retired lieutenant general in Japan’s military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, the prime minister would need approval from Japan’s Parliament for any such action.

Mr. Yamaguchi dismissed Mr. Trump’s reference to samurai warriors as a caricature. “Samurais are quiet up until the last moment,” he said. “And at the last moment, samurais do things decisively.”

At a dinner at the Akasaka Palace on Monday night, Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe showered praise on each other, reminiscing about how the Japanese prime minister was an early visitor to the newly elected American president before he took office.

Mr. Trump laid responsibility for the episode squarely on Mr. Abe, saying in his toast that he tried to prevent the visit after aides said it would be inappropriate to meet with a foreign leader before the inauguration, but Mr. Abe was already on his way to New York.

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website.

Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache, a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

They called themselves the Glass Ceiling Club.

A group of young and ambitious women in the 1990s from the investment bank Bear Stearns would gather at local restaurants every couple of months to discuss how to make the workplace more female friendly. The conversations would inevitably turn to their male colleagues, including the ones who behaved badly, said Maureen Sherry, a former managing director, who met regularly with the other women.

“Of course, our conversations would revert to sharing facts we knew about the men we worked with,” recalled Ms. Sherry, who spent nine years at Bear Stearns before leaving in 2000, adding, “yes, it was mostly the same men who preyed on young women.”

For women who had to interact with some of the most notorious sexual harassers, Ms. Sherry said she recommended they stay on the trading floor — a very public space.

“Survival hints like that were shared pretty freely,” Ms. Sherry wrote in an email.

That was the whisper network at work.

For as long as women have been in the labor force, this kind of behind-the-scenes support system has served as a vital source of shared information and a safe space for communal commiseration. Advice on salary negotiations, office politics and the work-life balance would be disseminated through informal conversations at cubicles, in cafeterias and over drinks at happy hour.

But the network also allowed employees to clue each other into a spectrum of behavior that was often unseen or ignored by their employers — the boss who scoffs at maternity leave, the manager known for ribald jokes, the colleague rumored to be a groper, or worse.

Now, with the internet offering a clearinghouse for complaints — intensified by the outpouring of allegations against prominent figures like the producer Harvey Weinstein — whisper networks have been amplified. Through public forums, invitation-only Facebook groups, private Google surveys, locked websites and shielded threads on anonymous apps, women — and some men — are seeking catharsis and validation by sharing their stories.

“We’re in this interesting period right now, kind of a hopeful period, where having prominent people name and talk about harassment has put a heightened awareness of it on the table,’’ said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women’s Law Center.

“When you have one person come forward, they become a huge target,” she added, “but when more people come out, it’s hard to go after all of them.”

In many cases, the network is driven by firsthand knowledge. Other times, it can be pure speculation. Allegations are often made anonymously and can quickly spread in online forums, damaging reputations before the accused can defend themselves. Men targeted by whisper networks complain of being subject to vigilantism and public shaming; some have threatened legal action.

At Bear Stearns — which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, during the financial crisis — the Glass Ceiling Club would warn others about the senior manager who had a history of affairs and a tendency to relocate his previous liaisons to remote offices, recalled Ms. Sherry, who last year published a semi-autobiographical novel, “Opening Belle,’’ about her experiences.

The women in the whisper network “weren’t best girlfriends,’’ Ms. Sherry said.

“What we did have in common was that we were ambitious professionals with the common goal of a more equal place of employment and so yes, that included our perplexity over outrageous behavior that went unchecked.“

Two decades later, fewer than two in 10 female harassment victims ever file a formal complaint, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .

The reluctance stems in part from the risks associated with reporting harassment, including fear of retaliation, according to The Harvard Business Review . Many women have reported being fired or sidelined at work after speaking up and labeled troublemakers while their tormentors face few, if any, consequences.

But when the whisper network moves onto social media platforms, accusations can gather momentum and quickly yield results.

In early October, a number of women came forward on Twitter to accuse Andy Signore, the creator of the popular YouTube series “Honest Trailers” and “Screen Junkies,” of sexual harassment.

One woman, April O’Donnell, said in a series of Twitter posts that Mr. Signore had tried to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. Ms. O’Donnell, who did not return several attempts to reach her, said on her Twitter feed that she and two other women had reported Mr. Signore in August to human resources at Defy Media, which owns “Screen Junkies,” which said it started an investigation.

But on their Twitter feeds, some women said the investigation seemed to stall and it was not until the allegations became public that Defy Media took action.

In a statement on Twitter on Oct. 8, Defy Media confirmed Mr. Signore’s termination, saying that new information had become available and the “scope and magnitude of his inappropriate actions became apparent.”

In a statement through his lawyer, Yana Henriks, Mr. Signore denied any allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation. He said that Defy Media used the allegations made against him as an opportunity to deprive him of his ownership stake in the company.

Social media helps retain and spread what Ms. Graves, of the National Women’s Law Center, calls “institutional memory.” A written story is easier to pass along than a spoken one, even if the original teller is anonymous, based in another office or leaves the company, she said.

The invitation-only Facebook group Tech Ladies provides information on job openings and invitations to networking events. But it also has a discussion called #HelpASisterOut where members can solicit advice about how to come forward with a harassment complaint or to ask about a company’s reputation or culture.

“What we’ll see is someone post that they are applying for a job at a company and ask if anyone has any good or bad stories about it,” said Allison Esposito, the founder of Tech Ladies. “If it was great, you’ll see that in the comments. But if it wasn’t, people will say ‘DM me’ or ‘let’s take it to the phone,’ to share the information.”

An app called Blind allows all employees from more than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb, to sign up through their work email but then chat anonymously about office and industry issues.

But in the past year, Blind has also become a hotbed for frank talk about sexual harassment.

When Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, claimed on her personal blog in February that her sexual harassment accusations against a direct supervisor were ignored by the company’s human resources department, Uber employees logged in to Blind more than 10 times on average each day — spending more than 3.5 hours — to discuss the scandal.

Outlets now abound for women — especially younger, newer employees — who might be left out of tightly guarded cliques of trust at work.

In private Facebook groups, women in the comedy profession share a list of men who have been banned from various venues across the country for inappropriate sexual behavior.

BetterBrave , an online guide to resources for sexual harassment victims in the workplace, has had more than 30,000 visits since being started this summer by three female friends in the tech industry. SheWorx, an advocacy group for female entrepreneurs, hosts an online survey asking for anonymous submissions of experiences related to gender-based bias and harassment, “from egregious incidents to the small paper cuts and micro-aggressions experienced every day.”

The anonymity attached to some allegations has spurred debate. A Google spreadsheet that named dozens of men in the media world, identifying individuals with descriptions ranging from leering to sexual harassment to assault, drew a mixed reaction when it was publicized in October.

Some applauded the public outing of the men who were accused. But others were outraged that the document had been widely disseminated, that the allegations had been made anonymously and the accused given no opportunity to defend or remove themselves from the list.

For Amanda Aiken, the whisper network worked. Sort of.

Ms. Aiken was a new paralegal at a small Canadian real estate investment firm when, during a company event in 2011, a top executive repeatedly tried to cajole her into going back to his home.

“His entire body was touching mine — I would try to get away from him, physically move away, and he would try to follow me,” she recalled in an interview.

In the following days, she learned that several other female colleagues had similar stories, including her friend, Erin Carson. After word filtered up to management, the women were soon summoned to a meeting with one of the company’s owners to discuss their allegations.

“There was some anger, there were some tears,” Ms. Carson, a receptionist at the firm in Victoria, B.C., said in an interview. “But it was kind of reassuring to know we weren’t alone.”

The executive left the company soon afterward. Ms. Aiken quit her job, citing a lingering feeling of awkwardness.

“Too many women have commented about how they just gave up because men didn’t listen when we said no and we felt powerless,” she said. “I want to get my power back.”

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — The moments following a horrific mass shooting that left 26 people dead at a Sunday church service in this rural Texas town came into clearer view on Monday morning, as the county sheriff detailed a firefight and car chase that ended with the gunman dead after a crash.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said that he believes that the gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, went around the outside of the church firing rounds before entering and shooting at parishioners. After Mr. Kelley exited the church, he and an armed bystander engaged in a brief “fire fight” before the suspect went into his vehicle, according to the sheriff. The gunman had dropped his rifle in the church after slaughtering the parishioners; he pulled a pistol during his exchange with the bystander.

The bystander — who Sheriff Tackitt said is a “hero” but declined to give his name — then waved down a man in a vehicle and the two began pursuing the gunman, Sheriff Tackitt said in an interview with CBS, and may have engaged in a firefight along the way before the gunman’s vehicle crashed into a fence.

Mr. Kelley, 26, was found to have a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but it is unclear if the wound was fatal or if he died from other injuries. The sheriff said that he did not yet know what the motive could have been, but he said that the shooter’s in-laws live in a nearby town and had previously attended the church on several occasions.

The in-laws and Mr. Kelley’s ex-wife were interviewed by investigators last night in Sutherland Springs. They were not in the town at the time of the shooting according to law enforcement. Sheriff Tackitt said one of the most horrific aspects of the mass killing were the number of children who had been shot. He did not give a definite number.

Mr. Kelley was clad in all black, with a ballistic vest strapped to his chest and a military-style rifle in his hands, when he opened fire on parishioners, turning this tiny town east of San Antonio into the scene of the country’s newest mass horror.

He had served in the Air Force at a base in New Mexico but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

The motive for the attack was unclear on Sunday, but the grisly nature of it could not have been clearer: Families gathered in pews, clutching Bibles and praying to the Lord, were murdered in cold blood on the spot.

Mr. Kelley started firing at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs not long after the Sunday morning service began at 11 a.m., officials said. He was armed with a Ruger military-style rifle, and within minutes, many of those inside the small church were either dead or wounded. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 72, and among the dead were several children, a pregnant woman and the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history. At least 20 more were wounded.

“It’s something we all say does not happen in small communities, although we found out today it does,” said Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County, which includes Sutherland Springs.

Sheriff Tackitt and other officials said the gunman first stopped at a gas station across Highway 87 from the church. He drove across the street, got out of his car and began firing from the outside, moving to the right side of the church, the authorities said. Then he entered the building and kept firing.

The authorities received their first call about a gunman at about 11:20 a.m. Officials and witnesses said Mr. Kelley appeared to be prepared for an assault, with black tactical gear, multiple rounds of ammunition and a ballistic vest.

“He went there, he walked in, started shooting people and then took off,” said Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas congressman who represents the region and who was briefed by law enforcement officials.

When Mr. Kelley emerged from the church, an armed neighbor exchanged gunfire with him, hitting Mr. Kelley, who fled in his vehicle. Neighbors apparently followed him, chasing him into the next county, Guadalupe County, where Mr. Kelley crashed his car. Mr. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle. Officials said it was unclear how Mr. Kelley had died.

At the church, he left behind a scene of carnage. Of the 26 fatalities, 23 people were found dead inside the church, two were found outside, and one died later at a hospital.

Speaking at a news conference in Japan, the first stop on his tour of Asia, President Trump called the shooting a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation,” adding the gunman was a “very deranged individual.” He also ordered flags flown at half-staff at the White House and all federal buildings through Thursday.

In Floresville, Tex., hours after the attack, Scott Holcombe, 30, sat with his sister on the curb outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center. They were both in tears. Their father, Bryan Holcombe, had been guest preaching at the church, they said, and he and their mother, Karla Holcombe, were killed.

“I’m dumbfounded,” Mr. Holcombe said, also noting that his pregnant sister-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, had been killed. “This is unimaginable. My father was a good man, and he loved to preach. He had a good heart.”

His sister, Sarah Slavin, 33, added: “They weren’t afraid of death. They had a strong faith, so there’s comfort in that. I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn’t scared.”

A parishioner, Sandy Ward, said that a daughter-in-law and three of her grandchildren were shot. Her grandson, who is 5, was shot four times and remained in surgery Sunday night. She said she was awaiting word on her other family members.

Ms. Ward said she did not attend services on Sunday because of her troubled knees and a bad hip. “I just started praying for everybody who was there” when she learned of the shooting, she said.

At a news conference on Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott said that he and other Texans were asking “for God’s comfort, for God’s guidance and for God’s healing for all those who are suffering.”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping in the investigation, which was being led by the Texas Rangers.

The shooting unfolded on the eighth anniversary of the attack in 2009 on Fort Hood in Texas, when an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, killed 13 people in one of the deadliest mass shootings at an American military base. Major Hasan carried out his attack in an attempt to wage jihad on American military personnel.

The death toll on Sunday also exceeded the number killed in 1966 by a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Charles Whitman, who opened fire from the school’s clock tower in a day of violence that ultimately killed 17. It also exceeded the number killed during a rampage at a restaurant in Killeen in 1991 in which a gunman fatally shot 23 people and then took his own life.

And the shooting on Sunday occurred more than two years after Dylann S. Roof opened fire at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015, killing nine people, including the pastor. The motive in that attack was racial hatred — Mr. Roof, a white supremacist, plotted an assault on a black congregation — but no motive has been established by the authorities in the shooting in Sutherland Springs. The First Baptist Church is predominantly white, and Mr. Kelley is white.

The authorities said Mr. Kelley used an Ruger AR-15 variant — a knockoff of the standard service rifle carried by the American military for roughly half a century.

Almost all AR-15 variants legally sold in the United States fire only semiautomatically, and they were covered by the federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994. Since the ban expired in 2004, the weapons have been legal to sell or possess in much of the United States, and sales of AR-15s have surged.

Ruger’s AR-15s made for civilian markets sell for about $500 to $900, depending on the model.

Mr. Kelley grew up in New Braunfels, in his parents’ nearly $1 million home, and was married in 2014. He had been married at least once before and was sued for divorce in 2012 in New Mexico, the same year he was court-martialed on charges of assaulting his wife and child.

Why he chose to attack a church 30 miles away from his home is one of the questions that remained unanswered.

Sutherland Springs in Wilson County is about 34 miles east of downtown San Antonio, in a slow-paced region where church-going is a common part of the Sunday routine. The church marquee on Sunday needed updating from last week, reading, “Join Us, Fall Fest, Oct 31, 6 to 8 PM.”

The unincorporated community has a population that numbers in the low hundreds — the 2000 census was 362, according to the Texas State Historical Association. The preliminary death toll would amount to about 7 percent of that population.

On Sunday night, a few minutes down a pitch-black road, victims’ families gathered at another house of worship, the River Oaks Church. Its parking lot was full of about 50 large trucks, and parents walked into the building holding their children’s hands.

The police kept tight control over the scene, refusing to allow any reporters to enter. One man in a cowboy hat was also turned away. “They said they’re gathering to inform the families, but they’ll only let immediate family in, only if you have a wristband,” he said. A short while later, a young man rushed out to his truck, visibly upset, and raced away.

The First Baptist Church, the scene of the shooting, was also sealed off, with yellow police-line tape posted around the church grounds.

First Baptist is a little church, albeit a tech-savvy one. The service at the church last Sunday was posted on YouTube, one of several posted there. Videos posted online show lyrics to the hymns appearing on television screens with parishioners playing electric guitars and a sign language interpreter translating the songs.

The video of last Sunday’s service begins with a rendition of a song called “Happiness Is the Lord.” Then the pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told his parishioners — 20 to 30 were visible in the video — to walk around the room and “shake somebody’s hand.”

“Tell them it’s good to see them in God’s house this morning,” Pastor Pomeroy said.","In Texas Shooting, Gunman Kills at Least 26",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html

The bears in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, in and around the park, are healthy now, and they have increased to at least 700 today from fewer than 150 in 1975, when they were listed as endangered.

But a genetic lifeline from Glacier bears, which are also related to the grizzlies of Canada, will mean a good deal more diversity to help assure the bears’ future. It’s so important that researchers have talked about trucking grizzly bears from the north to add to the Yellowstone gene pool.

“Because Yellowstone is a bit lower in genetic diversity, hundreds of years from now they might be less able to adapt to changing conditions — changing climate, changing food sources and disease resistance,” Dr. van Manen said.

While no one knows what advantageous traits the Glacier grizzlies might have in their genes, increasing diversity is the best way to assure resilience against those types of hazards.

Currently, the nearest interloper from the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem has bridged the 70-mile gap by working his way south. That grizzly is in the mountains near Butte, Mont., some 50 miles from the perimeter of the Yellowstone ecosystem.

Biologists and conservationists are rooting for a natural reunion between the two largest populations of grizzlies in the country, Dr. van Manen said.

In a study published in Ecosphere, researchers tracked grizzly bears from the northern and southern populations as they moved through western Montana, including the rugged Big Belt mountains near this city, which sits between the two national parks.

The effort to follow these nomadic bears was aided by satellite data collars and new, more powerful data analysis techniques. Some 124 males were monitored from 2000 to 2015, some for more than one year.

GPS collars can track a bear almost in real time, providing richly detailed information on the corridors and habitats they use that need to be protected.

While much of the land between the two parks is publicly owned and wild, it becomes a gauntlet in some places as bears migrate into towns, cities, ranches and farms.

The bears are likely to seek out dog food, beehives, garbage, chickens and even apple trees, getting into trouble that may require trapping and relocating them. Highway crossings, especially on I-90 and I-15, pose a serious risk.

Conservation groups and biologists say it’s a race against time to protect some of the open land between the two parks and to assure permanent transit routes for wildlife through land purchases or conservation easement.

Residential housing development north of Yellowstone around Bozeman, for example, is soaring.

“Even one house per square mile can be a problem for bears,” said Jodi Hilty, a wildlife biologist in Canmore, Canada. “At the same time, this is one of the most intact mountain ecosystems in the world.”

Dr. Hilty heads the group Yellowstone to Yukon, which seeks to link bears and other Yellowstone wildlife with populations in Glacier National Park and in vast tracts of wilderness in Canada. Protecting migration corridors between Yellowstone, Glacier and Canada would benefit not just bears, she said, but cougars, wolverines and other animals.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has removed the protections afforded under the Endangered Species Act from the Yellowstone grizzly because the population has grown so large. Dr. van Manen said that the number of grizzlies may exceed 1,000.

Environmentalists have sued the agency over its decision. They argue that climate change is a wild card that might someday cause the Yellowstone bear population to collapse.

With the bears delisted, some are concerned about plans by Montana officials to allow the hunting of Yellowstone grizzlies. Dr. David Mattson, a retired wildlife biologist, said that there is a good chance that “Montana will institute a more lethal regime, whether by sport hunting or by other means, that will compromise these prospects.”

The state has said it would not allow hunting in areas where the two populations might reconnect.

As bears explore far beyond their core habitats, people not accustomed to grizzlies need to be educated about bear-proofing garbage cans and sealing off beehives and chicken coops with electric fencing, Dr. van Manen said.

Carrying pepper spray has already become indispensable for hikers, hunters and others in many parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.

In 2016, four grizzlies were killed after confronting hunters in “defense of life” scenarios. Recently, a game warden near Cody, Wyo., shot and killed a female grizzly when it charged at him, leaving her cubs orphans.

Generally, though, the news for the big bear is good, said Dr. van Manen.

“There is strong scientific evidence that the recovery process that was put into place starting in the mid 1970s has paid off,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary effort for recovery of a species that has ability to kill people. For the American people to support it is a remarkable achievement.”",Yellowstone Grizzlies May Soon Commingle With Northern Cousins,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/science/grizzly-bears-yellowstone-genes.html

For a company like Subaru, with a brand image of being outdoors, dependable, inclusive and kind, those metrics help attract great employees. They also help the company’s marketing campaign.

The numbers are so important, in fact, that Sandy Capell, the philanthropy and corporate responsibility manager for the company and the Subaru of America Foundation, said she had turned to a software system to track employees who volunteered, tally their time and measure the impact of what they’re doing.

“The software puts the efforts in perspective,” Ms. Capell said. “We used to report hours and nothing else. After awhile it loses impact. Now we’re able to put a true impact on those hours.”

To do that, Subaru reached out to Blackbaud, a cloud software company that measures the effect of philanthropic efforts.

“They come to us, and to the market in general, because they want to tell their impact story to individuals,” said Kevin McDearis, executive vice president and chief products officer at Blackbaud. “They realize part of this is about building their brand and enhancing their brand.”

That marketing may also mean as much to employees as to consumers. “It’s getting to be a very competitive market out there, and people will pick a job, and maybe not the highest paid offer, if they feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves,” he said.

In a study by CECP, which promotes corporate philanthropy, and the Conference Board this year, a third of employees, on average, participated in corporate volunteerism, and nearly two-third of companies offered paid time off for volunteering.

But there is no room to fake it. A study on corporate social responsibility found that 65 percent of consumers check to see if a company is being authentic when it takes a stand on a social or environmental issue. That number rises to 76 percent for millennials.

The study also found that 78 percent of respondents wanted companies to take a stand. That’s a double-edge sword in a polarized time. While 87 percent of the people in the study said they would buy a product because of something the company advocated, 76 percent said they would not buy a product from a company they did not agree with.

“Everyone loves to feed the hungry and house the homeless,” Mr. McDearis said. But companies taking a stand can also “drive some interesting polarization.”

In the case of Subaru, it chose well-known, noncontroversial charities, like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Meals On Wheels.

Money for these charities comes through the company’s Share the Love campaign, in which it donates $250 from each vehicle bought or leased to various charities. (In nine years, the company said it had given $94 million to charity.

Ms. Capell said employees had volunteering goals each year, but that the company did not dictate where they could give their time. The hours get logged, and they get credit for them.

However, if employees want to volunteer during the workday, they choose among events the company has organized, like Habitat for Humanity. She said about 1,000 employees gave 5,100 hours last year. And this is where impact measurement comes in.

Many companies are turning to their own consumers to drive their giving.

Discovery Communications began a program in July to protect wild tigers by conserving land for them. The company, which produces programs like “Shark Week,” “Deadliest Catch” and “American Chopper,” aims to double the tiger population by 2022. It now stands at 4,000, compared with 400,000 for elephants.

“Tigers are apex predators,” said Jessica Beatus, vice president of standards, practices and social good at Discovery Communications and the creator and program director of Project CAT, which stands for conserving acres for tigers.

“When you support them, you support their entire ecosystem,” she said. “If you have too many prey, you have destruction of the habitat.”

She said the company had committed to support one million acres in India and Bhutan over six years.

The company is looking to use impact metrics to see where viewers are most interested in this campaign. “When we run a public-service announcement, does that translate to countries donating?” she said. “That was a big factor. Do people want to adopt a symbolic tiger? How many people participated? These campaigns are only as successful as you market them.”

And they do not all work. The company tested a similar donation scheme to help sharks in conjunction with “Shark Week.” “It didn’t have as many hits,” she said. “People go to the beach and hope not to see a shark.”

Other companies are offering customers what could be called a release valve for their giving. Last year, Evite, the online invitation service, created a system where people could give respondents a way to contribute to charities instead of bringing a gift to the party.

“We literally had a birthday party for my 4-year-old, and there was a stack of 30 presents that sat for probably a year,” said Victor Cho, chief executive of Evite. “She opened a few. But then we asked her why she didn’t open all of them. She said, ‘If I open it you’re going to make me write a thank you card’.”

Mr. Cho said that in less than two years of the charity option existing, the company would hit $5 million in donations. People can choose from 150,000 registered charities. “It’s not for everyone in the world, but the idea was if it’s gift 30 on top of other presents, let’s direct that consumer spending to a cause.”

The Evite and Discovery efforts are supported by Pledgeling, which allows companies to set up charity pages and track their impact.

“Cause marketing and corporate social responsibility are buzzwords that are web 2.0,” said James Citron, chief executive of Pledgeling. “The power of impact is to integrate charity into what you’re doing and track the” key performance indicators.

He said Pledgeling’s strategy is about, “What are you actually doing, and tell your customers the impact you’re having.”

The company charges a fee for its service, but generally 97 percent of the money raised goes to the charity. The company also can track what and how the campaign is doing.

There is yet another way for companies to have measurable impact. Companies like Warby Parker, which makes eyeglasses, and Toms, the shoe company, are pioneers among so-called give-back companies. Buy a pair of glasses or shoes, and they will give a pair to someone in need.

In terms of measuring the impact, the tracking is fairly easy because it is generally one to one. It is simple for the company to do and simple for the individual to understand.

Not all companies that want to do this have it so easy. A new subscription yoga clothes company, YogaClub, wanted to incorporate this giveback model.

Just one problem: giving fancy yoga clothes to needy children is not the same feel-good story as giving them a pair of shoes so they can walk to school or eyeglasses so they can read and learn.

So the company came up with a different plan. Its box of yoga clothes, which cost from $49 to $79 a shipment,arrive monthly or quarterly like a wine club: You pick the quantity, and the company decides what you get. For every box purchased, YogaClub donates one yoga class to a student from a disadvantaged school in Los Angeles.

Since July, the company said it had donated over 163,000 yoga classes to elementary school children in Los Angeles. “It’s teaching the fundamentals of how you use yoga and meditation to teach the kids how to deal with the stresses in their lives,” said Lindsay McClelland, director of partnership and brand experience at the company.

“It makes our customers feel good,” she added. “They can see their purchase isn’t just getting their two yoga pants. It’s having an impact in the community.”","Firms Learn That as They Help Charities, They Also Help Their Brands",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/corporate-philanthropy.html

To be clear, this is still just a plan. There are lots of negotiations to come, and the powerful real estate lobby has already suggested it will fight to retain the mortgage interest deduction, which has been widely decried as wasteful and unfair despite its benefits to homeowners.

Still, people generally like tax breaks. And two of California’s favorites are at risk.

Billions of bees are transported to California each year to pollinate almond groves, before moving on to prunes or plums, then cherries, and finally dispersing to crops like melons and blueberries.

But they don’t fly there.

One such highway shipment went awry last week, however, when a tractor-trailer loaded with bees crashed northeast of Sacramento.

The bees were coming from a Montana farm to escape cold weather, and would typically be kept in holding yards for months before being distributed to orchards. The Almond Board of California lists dozens of beekeepers and bee brokers from across the United States that will rent hives.

“It’s a real industrial endeavor now,” said Neal Williams, an associate professor of entomology at University of California, Davis, and the faculty co-director of its Honey and Pollination Center. “There is more money for most beekeepers in pollination compared to honey.”

Bees are vital to almond growers, Mr. Williams said, because the almond nut will not set unless pollen is transferred from one variety to another, which the bees do as they look for nectar. The bees benefit, too, because the crop is the first to bloom, in February or March, after the winter.

“They are going in at a time when they are very hungry,” Mr. Williams said.

Sgt. Tucker Huey of the Auburn Police Department, who responded to the crash scene, said initial hesitation to work among buzzing bees was unfounded.

“Some of the boxes broke and some of the lids came off during the crash,” Sergeant Huey said. “A lot of bees were free and flying around. They weren’t swarming too bad because it was dark and cool.”

The police and fire departments killed the bees with soapy water, Sergeant Huey said, on the recommendation of beekeepers who said the cargo could not be salvaged. Two people were stung, once each. He was spared.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

Zeldin of New York, a Republican from a similar district on Long Island, said it would be impossible for him to vote for the bill in its current form. Mr. Zeldin said he would favor a “big, beautiful tax cut,” but not one that took aim so directly at blue-state taxpayers.

“I view it as a geographic redistribution of wealth,” Mr. Zeldin said. “You’re taking more money from a state like New York, to pay for a deeper tax cut elsewhere.”

The potential backlash for suburban Republicans is significant. While the party’s base is mainly rural and culturally conservative, a small group of solidly Democratic states with complex local tax codes could, in theory, nearly cost Republicans control of the House. In New Jersey alone, there are as many as five Republican-held districts where the tax plan is likely to be unpopular; add in those in New York and California and the number approaches 20. To gain a majority, Democrats must take two dozen seats away from the G.O.P., and they have already been hungrily eyeing the educated suburbs where President Trump is unpopular.

The tax bill, pushed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House’s chief tax writer, would cut tax rates for many individuals and businesses, but would void or sharply limit a range of popular deductions. Of particular concern in New Jersey are proposals to put a cap of $10,000 on the property taxes that can be deducted at the federal level; to eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes; and to restrict the mortgage interest deduction to loans of $500,000 or less.

The changes to deductions would raise more than $1 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, to help offset the $2 trillion cost of lowering tax rates and doubling the standard deduction.

Nationwide, about one-fifth of all taxpayers claim the state and local tax deduction, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, but the proportion is much higher in New Jersey, where more than one-third claim the deduction, with an average of about $11,000 a year. In value terms, two states — California and New York — account for nearly one-third of the total claimed nationwide.

The House Ways and Means Committee will begin considering and amending the bill on Monday, with the goal of passing it out to the House floor by the end of the week. The Senate is expected to introduce its own version of the bill in a few days.

Most Republicans from New Jersey and New York have opposed the legislation in its earliest drafts, forcing congressional leaders to advance it with the narrowest of majority votes. Republican leaders in both states’ legislatures denounced the bill, and Kim Guadagno, the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, said in an interview that she would push the state’s congressional delegation to “condemn it.”

Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey State Assembly, said the party’s polling consistently found taxes to be a singular and overwhelming issue for voters. The state’s members of Congress, he said, had to fight fiercely for its fiscal interests.

“When you represent New Jersey, it’s extremely important to stand up for New Jersey,” said Mr. Bramnick.

In California, another state likely to be hit especially hard by the tax proposals, Republicans have been more supportive of the House bill, a dynamic that lawmakers attribute to the influence of Representative Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is the House majority leader.

But key blue-state Republicans face an agonizing balancing act, weighing their ambition to deliver broad tax cuts with the narrower interests of their districts. Where most Republicans take it as an article of faith that passing a tax bill would buoy the party in 2018, lawmakers in these areas worry that a law burdening the suburbs would doom them.

In New Jersey’s 11th District, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen already figured to face a stiff challenge in 2018 before the vote to approve consideration of the tax legislation, an important procedural step. He was one of few Republicans from the Northeast to vote in favor, and the only one from New Jersey. His vote did not sit well in his district, an affluent and well-educated area where the average household income is more than $100,000 a year.

Outside her office in a development of high-end stores and condos in Livingston, N.J., Vicki Stout, 55, said she had voted for Mr. Frelinghuysen in the past, but might reconsider her support. Ms. Stout, a real estate agent who is not registered with a political party, said the tax bill would both snarl her own taxes and deter potential clients from purchasing homes.

“It’s going to have people move out of the state, if it passes,” Ms. Stout said of the bill. “It makes absolutely no sense.”

Even voters who may support the legislation over all acknowledge that it will come at a cost to the district — and to them personally. Joe Giannotti, a contractor, estimated that he would pay several thousand dollars more in taxes if he lost the deductions that are currently under the knife.

But Mr. Giannotti, who said he usually votes Republican and supports President Trump, said it would be worth it.

“It would hurt this area, but it’s important for the good of the country,” Mr. Giannotti said, arguing that New Jersey Democrats should respond by cutting local taxes: “Let’s get the Democrats to get their policies in line.”

An aide to Mr. Frelinghuysen did not respond to a request for an interview. But Mr. Frelinghuysen, who chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee, has emerged as something of a bellwether figure in New Jersey. Though he is viewed locally as a moderate, Mr. Frelinghuysen has taken a series of perilous votes to back the agenda of Republican leaders, supporting both the tax plan and an unpopular bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Frelinghuysen, who has served in Congress since 1994, is facing his first concerted challenge in years after his district split almost evenly between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump in 2016. Democratic Party polling has found the tax issue to be a potent one in districts like his, with voters inclined to view it as a giveaway to the extremely wealthy, according to a strategist who advises House Democrats and was briefed on the polling.

Mikie Sherrill, a lawyer and former helicopter pilot who has emerged as the most formidable of Mr. Frelinghuysen’s potential Democratic opponents, quickly seized on the tax plan to brand the incumbent as out of touch.

Describing the bill as a “gut punch” to the district, Ms. Sherrill stressed that New Jersey taxpayers would not benefit from the legislation in the same way as people in redder states, where local tax deductions are less valuable.

“I don’t think we are going to feel it here in New Jersey as a tax-cut bill,” she said of the House plan. “Being middle class in New Jersey is a little different from being middle class elsewhere, like Alabama.”

That sense of regional grievance crosses party lines, with both Republicans and Democrats in prosperous coastal areas venting frustration at the possibility that their tax burden may rise as rates fall for corporations and taxpayers in redder states. Mr. Zeldin said that would exacerbate the existing indignity that New Yorkers pay more money in federal taxes than the state gets back from Washington.

Representative Peter T. King of New York, a Republican whose district neighbors Mr. Zeldin’s, said suburban voters would punish Republicans if the current bill becomes law. He said lawmakers had appealed to members of the Trump administration who hail from the area, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, but so far to little avail.

When the legislation is signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio, it will bring to a close an era when New York City was festooned with no-dancing signs, and multiply the places where people can openly get down.

“There are now thousands of places where dancing is legal,” said Andrew Muchmore, whose lawsuit against the city made the argument that the cabaret law limited the type of music he could play at his bar, Muchmore’s — lest it lead to dancing.

At Bossa Nova Civic Club in Bushwick, advocates threw a party on Saturday to celebrate. A D.J. wove together electronic music and familiar pop hits. Balloons bobbed over the crowd. People wore Mardi Gras beads and T-shirts that said “Let NYC Dance.”

“It’s great,” said Gareth Solan, 27, who plans to turn the outdoor venue Nowadays in Ridgewood, Queens, into a dance-oriented indoor club, and was among the first on the dance floor. “The parties are going to get better and the people who host them are going to be able to do it without fear.”

Though Mr. de Blasio’s administration did not aggressively enforce the Cabaret Law, its opponents said having it on the books chilled relations between venue owners and the authorities and drove dancing into unsafe warehouses. (Repealing the law will not lead to more rambunctious night life, they have said, because of already-existing restrictions on noise and capacity).

Councilman Espinal arrived at Bossa Nova before midnight, as the bar neared its capacity of 141.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.","Hurricanes, some tour operators say, tend to scare away leisure travelers or steer them to other destinations unscathed by the weather as they make plans for winter travel. For every Puerto Rico, St. John, St. Martin, Dominica and other islands ravaged by hurricanes this year, operators said, there’s an Aruba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and other Caribbean spots ready and open for business.

But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.

That would be me.

I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year’s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer’s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.

Through a cousin in Texas I found out about another cousin who lives near El Yunque National Forest in the northeast of Puerto Rico. Through another cousin in San Juan I learned about other relatives scattered in both urban and rural areas around the island. All my loved ones were safe, though in survival mode.

My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.

What was left of “El Yunque,” known for its waterfalls and endangered parrots, I wondered? I later learned that the 28,000-acre treasure, El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system and a major driver of the island’s tourism, was obliterated.

What about the restaurants and kiosks nearby along Luquillo Beach — Jibaro’s, Terruño, La Parrilla — always good for fritters like alcapurrias, home cooking and music after a day in the sun? Was Old San Juan still recognizable? Did the ice cream place with the long lines for the freshly made waffle cones, Mantecaditos Los Chicos, survive in Culebra, the Puerto Rican island municipality to the east? What was the damage to the delicate bioluminescent bay in Vieques, another island municipality?

What did Hurricane Maria not annihilate? How long would it take for it all to come back?

Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.

She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquerón, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition — they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.

“If worst comes to worst we go a month later,” she said.

Restored power was a big “if,” though. By early November, more than a month after the hurricane hit, the power company was generating less than 40 percent of electricity, government figures showed. Close to 20 percent of the island was without running water and about a third without telecommunication services.

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the White House to rebuild the power system, has warned that total power restoration could take nearly a year, partly because of the challenge of getting supplies like utility poles quickly to an island.

Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.

“Power lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,” Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.

Both governors in the American Caribbean — Puerto Rico with a population of 3.4 million, and the United States Virgin Islands, with about 110,000 residents — have optimistically said that nearly all power should be back by Christmas because of a ramp-up in restoration work.

In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.

But while cruise ship traffic has been rebounding, top hotels in Puerto Rico like El San Juan Hotel and Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, shut down because of damages and many of those that remained open with the help of generators were housing workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.

In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.

“We lost the last quarter of the year,” said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.

It is true that tourism-dependent islands have been able to recover quickly after hurricanes, even if visitors have to look at topless palm trees. When I reported from St. Thomas, St. Martin (divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten) and Antigua less than two months after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995, I found varying degrees of progress, but much of the tourist industry was ready for visitors and some tourists were trickling back.

But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.

José Izquierdo, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, said that such impact has led the agency to appeal to new types of travelers. One local tour operator that the agency has partnered up with, Local Guest, planned to take volunteers to mountainous regions where brigades of about 15 people each could plant crops of coffee and root vegetables, rebuild bridges and homes and help in other recovery efforts.

Some travel companies, like Global Works Travel, are signing up high school students to visit in 2018 and combine community service with a vacation.

Mr. Izquierdo said that he also expected more Puerto Ricans to visit from the mainland, perhaps those who had not visited in several years and were anxious to reunite with relatives on the island after the disaster. The local newspapers have noted the influx and I personally know friends who headed for the island as soon as flights became available to bring supplies and money and to check up on relatives. (By the same token, others were hosting Puerto Rican friends and relatives escaping the hardships of the island temporarily in New York and New Jersey.)

“A hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,” Mr. Izquierdo said. “The diaspora now takes a greater prominence.”

Within days of the hurricanes, volunteers started showing up in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where the organization All Hands Volunteers set up operations in the gym at the Kingdom Life International Christian Center in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.

The disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.

“Anyone can help,” he said. “There’s a need for people to carry things. There’s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.”

One volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as “lush, green and beautiful.” A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.

“Seeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,” said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. “This is something that I should be doing.”

Regular visitors to the Virgin Islands like Joanne Barker, a resident of Washington who last went to St. John in January, have found ways to send care packages directly to those in need. Ms. Barker said she was shopping in October to fill up boxes with items like baby powder milk formula and diapers after being paired up with families through a site — Adopt a Family in USVI — that matches donors to specific people.

“At least you’re doing something,” she said. “You just feel so helpless up here.”

Tourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only “minimal” structural damage (although it lost many trees).

And, he added: “At the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn’t washed away by the hurricane. That’s stronger than ever.”

But some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies — and no public health issues.

“Given the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Richards said, “it’ll take a long time for things to get restored.”

Puerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.

My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.

She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.

“I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we’re all working and that we’re doing better than a lot of people,” she told me over the phone, “but sometimes it’s hard not to get depressed.”

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.

Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled.

“It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.”

By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.

One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.

“Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.”

By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.

Who is responsible?

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.

Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.

Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.

“I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.

In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.”

What will happen to the detainees?

Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.

They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.

American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia.

If those options do not work out, there is another possibility: Russell Crowe, the Australian actor, offered on Twitter Wednesday to provide housing and jobs for six of the men.

Mr. Northam holds a 26-point lead among voters from Northern Virginia; voters from that area said they backed Mrs. Clinton by 31 points. It’s a pattern up and down the ballot.

The pattern has also been fairly common beyond Virginia this year. In special congressional elections, Republicans have fallen far short of Mr. Trump’s strong showing in white working-class areas, while Democrats have struggled to exceed Mrs. Clinton’s showing in the areas where she excelled, like Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District.

Mr. Northam entered the race as a clear if modest favorite. Virginia, with a high percentage of college-educated voters, backed Mrs. Clinton by a five-point margin in November, and the national political environment would seem to be very favorable to a Democrat.

Mr. Trump’s approval rating has consistently been in the 30s, and Democrats have a considerable lead on the generic congressional ballot.

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating was at 39 percent in the Upshot/Siena survey, with his disapproval at 51 percent. These figures are somewhat better for Mr. Trump than those of most other surveys — perhaps in part because this poll tries to capture likely voters in an off-year election, and those voters are considerably older and whiter than the overall adult population.

The poll was sampled from an L2 voter file, and it’s weighted to a likely electorate. It supposes a turnout of around 2.4 million votes, up somewhat from the 2.24 million cast in the 2013 governor’s race. But higher or lower turnout would not necessarily be a clear advantage for either side, according to our results. The Democratic strength among well-educated voters — and the robust Democratic turnout in the primary for this race — gives the party more strength among high-turnout voters than has been the case in recent elections.

About 14 percent of respondents were undecided or refused to answer, while another 2 percent backed the Libertarian candidate Cliff Hyra. The relatively high proportion of undecided voters is partly because the sample includes a large number of less likely voters, who are vastly more likely to be undecided than the likeliest voters. Many public polls sample only frequent voters, or screen their sample down to the likeliest voters. Mr. Northam would have led by three points, 46 to 43, if the sample had counted only voters who were “almost sure” or “very likely” to vote.

How the Poll Has Changed

The poll is the first Upshot/Siena survey since the 2016 presidential election, when polls generally overstated Mrs. Clinton’s support in the decisive battleground states.

Mr. Trump led by four points in our final Florida survey in 2016, and he was tied in our final North Carolina survey.

But the Upshot/Siena survey also had Mrs. Clinton up by seven points in earlier polls of North Carolina and Pennsylvania, taken soon after the third debate, when she still had a wide lead in national and battleground state polls. The apparent shifts over the last few weeks of the race make it more difficult to assess the performance of these surveys.

But a close analysis of last year’s surveys, combined with insights from across the survey industry, has helped inform two initial changes to the Upshot/Siena poll since last November’s election.

First, the poll is weighted by self-reported education to match estimates based on the census’ Current Population Survey. There’s considerable evidence that the failure to weight by education was a major reason state pre-election polls were off the mark, especially in the Rust Belt states.

It’s not so clear that education weighting would have considerably improved the performance of Upshot/Siena surveys. That’s because the Upshot/Siena sample design and weighting scheme was already intended to properly represent low-turnout voters, who tend to be less educated.

The education weight had no effect on the results of this Virginia survey.

Second, we sampled and weighted to a likely electorate, rather than registered voters. Similarly, the modeled turnout score — our estimate for the probability that a voter will turn out, based on past voting record and other measures — now represents 60 percent of our estimate that a respondent will turn out, up from 50 percent in 2016. The remaining 40 percent of the estimate is based on respondents’ answers to several questions about their interest in politics, the coming election and their intention to vote.

Over all, these changes would have eliminated about half of the bias and one-third of the error in our final three surveys in 2016. (That may not be generalizable to other elections.)

Ukrainians living in the western half of Ukraine aspired to membership in the European Union and NATO, while those in the eastern half near the city of Donetsk oriented themselves toward Russia, which exerted maximum influence to keep Ukraine closely aligned.

In 2004, the European Union and NATO experienced a burst of membership expansion to countries bordering Ukraine and Russia, including the formerly Soviet Baltic States, much to the consternation of the Kremlin. That year, the presidential candidate for the pro-Russia Party of Regions was the former Donetsk regional governor, Viktor F. Yanukovych. The battle to lead the nation had become part of the broader competition between the democratic West and Russia.

Mr. Yanukovych appeared to have won the election, but the outcome was marred by voter fraud and the poisoning of his opponent, Viktor Yushchenko, who favored alignment with the West. Ukrainians took to the streets to protest, in what became known as the Orange Revolution. Mr. Yushchenko won in a new election. Sometime after that, pro-Russian forces recruited Mr. Manafort to advise the Party of Regions and Mr. Yanukovych.","With Manafort, It Really Is About Russia, Not Ukraine",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/opinion/with-manafort-it-really-is-about-russia-not-ukraine.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services — services that help other businesses build and run software — which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world’s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.

Neural networks are rapidly accelerating the development of A.I. Rather than building an image-recognition service or a language translation app by hand, one line of code at a time, engineers can much more quickly build an algorithm that learns tasks on its own.

By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.

But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-François Gagné, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as “a new kind of computer programming.”

In building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a “dark art,” just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.

But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.

Photo

Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.

This is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around. But it is part of a significant trend in A.I. research. Experts call it “learning to learn” or “meta-learning.”

Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.

“Computers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,” said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. “Algorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly — at least that is the hope.”

This is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.

Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. “It is just a matter of when,” he said.",Building A.I.

Back Story

It is said that history is written by the winners, but sometimes the losers aren’t forgotten.

Sunday was Guy Fawkes Night in England, an annual celebration named after a participant in a plot in 1605 to kill King James I.

Photo

Organized by a group of Catholics, the idea was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.

The men managed to move 36 barrels of gunpowder directly beneath the House of Lords chamber, and Fawkes was responsible for lighting the fuse.

An anonymous letter sent to a Catholic lord warned him to stay away, arousing suspicions, and a search led to the discovery of Fawkes and the gunpowder. He and his conspirators were later executed, but his legacy lives on.

Even today, royal bodyguards make a ceremonial search of the cellars before the State Opening of Parliament, and in a BBC poll in 2002 Fawkes was voted the 30th greatest Briton.

The English celebrate his failure with fireworks, bonfires (topped by an effigy known as a guy) and a bit of folk verse:

“Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. I see no reason gunpowder treason should ever be forgot!”

Thomas Furse contributed reporting.

Wheatcroft was using new technology that had not been tested in a race. He understood that many things could go wrong. The metal girders of bridges along the course scrambled the digital compass on his iPhone. He worried about other possible navigational glitches caused by Bluetooth interference.

What if someone stopped in front of him to take a selfie? How would he refill his water bottle? Could he remain on course as the race turned off Fifth Avenue and funneled into Central Park at Mile 24, curling around the reservoir, which had seemed to befuddle his GPS on some test runs?

He had used technology, such as Runkeeper, an app that gave his pace and distance with voice commands. But corrective navigation for visually impaired runners was in its infancy. As Sunday’s race approached, Wheatcroft described himself as excited, nervous, a little fearful.

“It’s a complicated course, there’s a lot of people, you can’t afford to make mistakes,” he said. “Reaction times need to be sharp.”

His biggest concern, he said, was correctly interpreting the patterns of vibrations on his arm and chest. If he became confused, he planned to do what marathon runners often did in times of stress: slow down.

Wheatcroft was a seasoned distance runner, having completed the Boston Marathon three times and ultramarathons as long as 83 miles. In 2014, he ran from Boston to New York as a warm-up, then ran the New York City Marathon. He hoped to finish in four and a half hours on Sunday, more than 40 minutes faster than his previous best in New York.

Wheatcroft and Kevin Yoo, one of three founders of WearWorks, had been testing the Wayband technology since April. As with any prototypes, there were advances and setbacks. On Friday afternoon in Central Park, and again Saturday, last-minute refining continued with the chest sensor.

Keith Kirkland, another founder of WearWorks, joked about running along the course during the race and calling out, “Anyone have a soldering iron?”

On Sunday, Yoo started his first marathon, hoping to accompany Wheatcroft for as long as he could. The Wayband device was turned off for the first two miles of the race on the ascent and descent of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Too many runners packed together. Too much risk of technological overload.

“Could we ask everyone to be considerate and please not use their cellphones?” Yoo joked before the race.

Crosswinds blowing over the chest sensor gave confusing signals to Wheatcroft on the bridge, but the roadway was wide and he had plenty of open space to run. Neil Bacon, a friend who has often accompanied Wheatcroft, reminded him not to get too exuberant.

“You’re doing 26 miles,” Bacon said. “Don’t go off like it’s a half-marathon.”

At the first water stop, about two and a half miles into the race, a guide for another runner stopped in front of Wheatcroft. His chest sensor was set to alert him when an obstacle was seven feet away. He did not have enough time to stop and clipped the woman from behind, but neither was hurt. At the second water stop, he slowed and moved to the center of the road.

Just after Mile 3, the Wayband device signaled incorrectly that Wheatcroft was headed in the wrong direction. He stopped and walked for a minute, then renewed his pace. Tall and thin, wearing a white cap on his shaved head, he had run four miles without any assistance.

Taking in the aromatic scents of late-morning cooking in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Wheatcroft said, “I could run this thing on smell.”

But he would have to be prepared if his digital compass went haywire later in the race — while on the Pulaski Bridge at the halfway point, the Queensboro Bridge between Miles 15 and 16 or the Willis Avenue Bridge at Mile 20 — and the vibrations from his armband signaled incorrectly that he was veering off course.",Blind Runner’s Wearable Technology Gets Off to Complicated Start,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/sports/blind-marathoner-technology.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The luxury automaker BMW has issued two recalls involving about one million cars and sport utility vehicles that are at risk of catching fire even when they are not in use.

The first recall covers more than 672,000 cars. It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.

The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i. In these vehicles, the heater designed to keep the positive crankcase ventilation from freezing has the potential to short-circuit, causing the parts inside its valve to melt. The crankcase ventilation system helps gases escape from an internal combustion engine.

In building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a “dark art,” just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.

But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.

Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.

This is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around. But it is part of a significant trend in A.I. research. Experts call it “learning to learn” or “meta-learning.”

Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.

“Computers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,” said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. “Algorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly — at least that is the hope.”

This is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.

Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. “It is just a matter of when,” he said.",Building A.I.

About 70 years ago, Beulah Wilson and her husband, Jonah, set out to find a new place to call home outside San Antonio. They searched for seven years, looking for a safe area with good schools and friendly neighbors, before they found the perfect community: Sutherland Springs.

When they arrived, the area’s most promising days in south-central Texas had come and gone. The Great Depression had ended the wintertime flow of wealthy northern tourists who came to bathe in the sulfur springs on the Cibolo Creek. A 52-room luxury hotel had been deserted.

But Ms. Wilson saw something special in Sutherland Springs.

“Everybody knew everybody,” Ms. Wilson, 88, said on Sunday evening. “You didn’t keep your doors locked or your cars locked, unless you lived on the main street. We had no crime here.”

Over the weekend, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia announced the arrests of 11 of his princely cousins, among them some of the kingdom’s most prominent businessmen; he also announced several dramatic changes to top government ministries, including the creation of a powerful new anticorruption committee. Why? Was it a coup? The response to a failed coup? Some kind of purge?

The background to these events is the continuing centralization of power in the hands of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is one of King Salman’s sons. Over the past two years he has taken over most of the key economic and security posts and has clearly emerged as the most important operator in the government. The crown prince is also deputy prime minister (under the king, who is also prime minister) and minister of defense. All this at the age of 32.

This steady seizure of power has given rise to resistance within and outside the royal family, and Mohammed bin Salman’s elevation to crown prince was not unanimously supported when the top royal princes met to approve it. In the Saudi system, power has been passed among the sons of the founder of the modern Saudi kingdom, known as Ibn Saud, since his death in 1953. That made the king more primus inter pares than absolute monarch. One king was removed by his brothers (Saud, in 1964), and the system has permitted fiefs: The late King Abdullah was head of the National Guard for decades, and his son Miteb bin Abdullah took it over after his death; the late Prince Nayef served as minister of interior for 37 years and his son came after him; the late Prince Sultan was minister of defense for nearly a half century, and his son Khalid was his deputy.

Crown Prince Mohammed is putting an end to all that, taking some of those posts himself and removing others from the seemingly permanent control of any one branch of the family. All power is going to his branch — to his father, himself and his own allies; one brother is now the new Saudi ambassador to the United States.

Among the most notable moves was the removal of Prince Miteb — son and close adviser of Salman’s predecessor, the late King Abdullah — as head of the National Guard. You don’t need to be addicted to “Game of Thrones” to see the logic in that move: don’t allow a potential rival to keep his hands on a major locus of military power in the kingdom. Similarly, the arrest of perhaps the kingdom’s richest man, the billionaire international investor Alwaleed bin Talal, will both clip his wings and send a message that no one is beyond reach.

Q. I am about to close on a house in New Canaan, Conn., and my move-in date is flexible. What tasks are best done while the house is still vacant?

A. Buy a house, and finishing the to-do list can take months — or even years. While many chores happen in bits and pieces over the time that you live in your home, a few essential tasks should be done right away. Dispense with the disruptive ones before the moving truck arrives, and you will thank yourself later.

So, where to start? Look no further than the front door, and change the locks. By now, the previous owner’s friends, neighbors and brokers may have copies of the keys. So make new ones. If you plan to install a home security system, do so before your valuables arrive. Get a certificate of installation from your security company to send it to your homeowner insurance carrier so you can get a discount on your policy.

Schedule an appointment with your internet, television and telephone providers to wire your home for service before you arrive. “Nowadays, if people don’t have a Wi-Fi network installed, it’s hard to even function,” said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with Halstead in New Canaan.

Next, hire a housekeeping service to give the house a deep clean. Make sure the package includes details like cleaning the inside of light fixtures, windows, closets and cupboards, the basement and the attic. “Do it once, and do it right,” Mr. Sneddon said. Get the ductwork, heating and cooling systems serviced.

In September, Tom Cruise stepped into a car with Conan O’Brien and, with his characteristic exuberance, exclaimed that he was ready to sing karaoke or talk comedy. Mr. O’Brien waved away those ideas. “My thing, Tom, is take it back to basics,” he said, before describing his plan: “Two guys, just driving.”

What followed was not a spoof of James Corden’s signature “Carpool Karaoke” but something delightfully weirder than that. This 11-minute video began as cringe-comedy performance art, with Mr. Cruise bored and baffled, and Mr. O’Brien, quietly driving, as a hostile, frighteningly intense version of himself. Then the narrative turned into a kind of thriller as the hero, Mr. Cruise, in his best comic role since “Tropic Thunder,” slowly realized he was trapped with a maniac and needed to take desperate measures. It was the funniest bit on late night I had seen all year.

Among the scrum of late-night hosts, Conan O’Brien — who is set to shoot his TBS show, “Conan,” at the Apollo Theater beginning Monday as part of the New York Comedy Festival — is not earning the highest ratings or generating the most talk. But his show has become more distinctive than ever, doubling down on comedy for comedy’s sake. Now that New York magazine has called Jimmy Kimmel the new Walter Cronkite , and Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert pursue viral moments with games or political diatribes, Conan O’Brien suddenly seems like not only the sole host in the time slot truly desperate to make you laugh, but also the most willing to take artistic risks.

Maybe he really is just going back to basics. It’s easy to take Mr. O’Brien’s gift for refined silliness for granted, since he has been doing the job for nearly a quarter century. His show still looks a bit like what Johnny Carson did for decades: emerge from a curtain to big applause, deliver a topical monologue, then move to a desk, banter with a sidekick, do a comedy bit and talk to guests.

Instead of shying from appearing old-fashioned, Mr. O’Brien now uses that image, poking fun at himself, which was part of the joke of the Tom Cruise bit, but also earnestly embracing his status as the éminence grise of late night. When his sidekick, Andy Richter, ad-libbed a line a few weeks ago that referenced Jack Benny, Mr. O’Brien laughed, adding, “Could you send everyone a letter telling them who that is?” After a break, he brought up Benny again, recommending him to the audience, surely the only plug that this comedy legend has received on late night in a long while.

In his first years on TBS, Mr. O’Brien still seemed haunted by losing “The Tonight Show,” but his series now has the pleasing eccentricity of someone who doesn’t care about ratings or expectations.

In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who can’t stop making bad puns (“I don’t want to sound like your mummy but …”), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy. The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brooks’s classic sendups of the conventions of comedy.

Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesn’t mean they aren’t peculiar. Mr. O’Brien’s brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew. Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances. But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched. The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame.

While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen. A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers. But they won’t age well, and Mr. O’Brien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.

This even extends to how Mr. O’Brien handles politics. While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities. Mr. O’Brien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years.

Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.

Earlier this year, there were rumors that “Conan” was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule. But here’s hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect. The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but it’s worth examining if it comes at a cost. Comedy doesn’t need to serve a political end to be important.

But too often they have been, like the young horse-mutilator in “Equus,” freaks and villains. More recently, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” featured a hero on the spectrum — a role now being played, in a regional production, by Mickey Rowe, an actor with autism. And in “Uncommon Sense,” Andrew Duff, the actor who plays Moose, has a diagnosis of autism too.

Still, it can be difficult to find ways to tell the stories of nonverbal characters like Moose and Lali authentically, when even their parents don’t know what those stories are.

Photo

Mr. Paris and Ms. Paris-Carter, a couple with a family member on the spectrum, get around that problem by packing as much variety into their narrative as a 100-minute show will allow. As members of Tectonic Theater Project, they are expert mosaicists, comfortable with the process of research and montage that produced earlier Tectonic docu-plays like “The Laramie Project.” Though fiction, “Uncommon Sense” was developed over several years of investigation with “autism families” in Northern Iowa and elsewhere.

The result can sometimes feel too programmatic. Putting across so many medical factoids and bits of real stories has the paradoxical effect of diminishing a sense of emotional truth. You can almost count the items on a worthy checklist being addressed, one by one, in the intercut vignettes: safety, sexuality, employability, the push-pull of independence. But with their exceptional and sometimes opaque traits, Moose and Lali and Dan and Jess, who are composites, never cohere as characters.

Or perhaps that’s just the perspective of a neurotypical observer — a perspective that the play implicitly asks us to question. When the sound of silverware being sorted makes Moose scream, “Uncommon Sense” helps us understand his discomfort by having us hear an avalanche of grating metal. (The sound design is by Stephanie Robinson.) When Jess reacts painfully to the fluorescent lighting “vibration” that a classmate doesn’t even notice, she seriously asks him, “What’s wrong with you?” One person’s disability is another’s exceptional awareness.

Even so, I suspect that most audience members who don’t live with autism will have an easier time connecting to the stories of the parents, whose highest hopes for their children begin where the depths of other parents’ despair might end. Lali’s mother, afraid that she will never be more than “a thing” to her daughter, dreams of a day when the girl might somehow be able to say, as other children do, whatever is on her mind. Spoiler alert: Be careful what you wish for.

And Moose’s parents must in the course of the play contend with the likelihood that their son’s abilities may never improve. What kind of life will he have, and how much of their own lives can they sacrifice to provide it? By serving, in effect, as his brain in the world, are they preventing him from achieving whatever growth is possible? Would he be happier in an institution? What would “happier” mean?

In the context of these racking questions, many of the play’s comic devices, no doubt intended to balance the pathos, seem labored. (Dan, on a first date, licks a young woman’s feet as a cat might.) Strangely for a work about difference, the shape of the storytelling tends toward the conventional. Yet when uncomfortable scenes are allowed to develop naturally — such as those in which Jess tries to manage a flirtation with the classmate she’s tutoring — real comedy, mixed with sadness, emerges.

If “Uncommon Sense” had less of an overview in mind, it might have focused more profitably on this or any one of its other stories. As it is, under Mr. Paris’s sometimes inventive but sometimes awkward direction, on a cramped multi-platform set by John Coyne, there is too much information pressing in from all sides. Neither the eye nor the mind is comfortable anywhere.

Finding that inner peace took Mr. Hamill several months of frustration and self-pity — not to mention a Lucasfilm-mandated regimen of dieting and exercise, during which he thought to himself: “Why are they training me to turn and remove a hood? I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal. The series defined and dominated his career, even as he took on other film, television and theater roles; the franchise went into periods of hibernation, then came roaring back and restored him to relevance when he least expected it.

But Mr. Hamill isn’t bitter or jaded, and he isn’t Luke, though he has retained some of that character’s incorruptibility. He’s gone from a new hope to an old hand, with a lined, expressive face and a gray beard, beneath which lurks a mischievous sense of humor, a yearning to perform and a joy in sharing “Star Wars” war stories.

At heart, he is as much of an unapologetic geek as any of his admirers, as astonished by the circumstances that brought “Star Wars” into his life as he is grateful that he gets to return to its galaxy of long ago and far, far away.

“I’m such a fraud,” he said with a theatrical air. “But I’m enjoying all the residual attention that the movie’s getting. I should be, by all rights, puttering in my garden with a metal detector, telling kids to get off my lawn. What’s not to love?”

On this October afternoon, he was at home with his wife, Marilou, and their daughter, Chelsea; the couple also has two sons, Nathan and Griffin. The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars’” and its sequels.

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani newlywed has been arrested and charged with murder in the poisoning of 17 people, including several of her in-laws, in what officials described as an attempt to escape from a forced marriage.

The woman, Aasia Bibi, 21, and a man identified as her boyfriend were accused of having intentionally put rat poison into milk that was served to family members at a gathering.

Ms. Bibi, who appeared in a court in Punjab Province, told reporters she had begged her parents not to force her to marry, but her pleas were ignored. She has been charged under the country’s antiterrorism law and was placed in pretrial detention.

After consuming the tainted milk two weeks ago, 27 members of the extended families were hospitalized. Seventeen of them, including a 4-year-old, a 7-year-old and Ms. Bibi’s husband, Muhammad Amjad, 23, died, officials said.

The couple was married six months ago, the police said.

“But she was not happy with the marriage,’’ Jam Abdul Razzaq Klasra, a local police official, said in a telephone interview. Ms. Bibi was in love with another man, Muhammad Shahid, he said.

The families of Mr. Amjad and Ms. Bibi live on the same street in Malawat, a remote village in the Muzaffargarh district. Because there is not a hospital nearby, the family members who became ill were treated initially by a hakim, a local physician using traditional remedies. When their conditions deteriorated, they were taken to a hospital in Multan.

Mr. Klasra, the police official, said the head of one of the families suspected that the milk had been contaminated. Ms. Bibi was the only person at the family gathering who did not drink the milk, investigators learned, he said.

“As we investigated deeper, we learned that the relations between Aasia and her husband were strained,” Mr. Klasra said.

After the police took Ms. Bibi in for questioning, she confessed to having mixed pellets of rat poison into the milk, he said.

She told the police that Mr. Shahid had promised to marry her and that one of his aunts had been involved in planning the poisoning, Mr. Klasra said.

The aunt has also been arrested.

Arranged marriages are still common in Pakistan, particularly in rural areas. When couples attempt to marry for love, outside of family arrangements, they are often killed by family members.

“Arranged marriage is a source of comfort for most parents here as they feel that the existing close ties between families will strengthen the new relationship,” said Salman Sufi, an aide to Punjab’s chief minister.

Societal changes and young people’s increased exposure to the outside world has led some to question the logic of arranged marriages and even to rebel against the tradition, he said.

“The result often is a severely fractured relationship between spouses or catastrophic aftereffects, like we witnessed in this case,” Mr. Sufi said.

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:",The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

Some scholars have thought it a forgery, but Shorto argues that it is not, and without doubt it is a good read. Coghlan’s father, a British officer assigned to the United States during the Revolution, forced her at age 14 to marry the British lieutenant John Coghlan, probably to put an end to her dalliance with Aaron Burr. She detested her husband, ran away and availed herself of an English lord, whereupon her father sent her to a nunnery. After she escaped, he disowned her.

A string of lovers supported her passion for fine things, but one had gambling debts that mounted until he could not afford to pay her bills. Debtors’ prison was looming when her false death notice appeared in the newspapers. But soon she reappeared in Paris, and the pattern of lovers and debtors’ prison resumed. Then she disappeared from the historical record, leaving behind a mystery: Did she die in prison? Or did she get away with faking her own death once more?

Both Cornplanter and Margaret Coghlan met George Washington. It was otherwise for Venture Smith (whose Western African name was Broteer Furro). Brought to New England as a slave when he was a boy, he grew into a formidable man, over six feet tall, 300 pounds, and amazingly strong. He was of steady temper, though he could be pushed too far. When one master and his brother beat him, Smith stacked them on top of each other and stomped both at the same time.

Smith’s son Cuff marched with George Washington, but Smith himself was too absorbed in making a life for his wife and children to participate in the Revolution. By persuading one of his masters to hire him out, he earned the money to buy freedom for himself and his family and to invest in land, including a parcel in Connecticut where he built a three-level home, a barn and a forge. Although he never learned to write, he was adept at complex financial transactions and willingly used his skill to help other free blacks establish themselves.

In old age, stooped and blind, Smith was proud of his achievements but bitter about the obstacles he had faced because he was black. Still, he found reason for gratitude. “My freedom,” he said, “is a privilege which nothing else can equal.”

Closer to the Revolution was Abraham Yates, a shoemaker of deceptively meek appearance who educated himself in the law and, with help from the future New Jersey governor William Livingston, broke through New York’s ruling clans to become an influential politician. During the war he served in New York’s Provincial Congress, helped write New York’s Constitution and corresponded with Washington. Afterward, convinced that the United States Constitution was written for the privileged few, he threw himself into defeating its ratification. Losing the battle did little to deter him, and in the last years of his life, he was still defending the rights of the common man.

In a portrait painted by George Romney, Lord George Germain, another of Shorto’s subjects, wears a silver wig and red jacket. England’s secretary of state for the American colonies has a hint of hauteur about him, but also a sense of doubt.

He may be wondering whether England will defeat the American rebels. Should that fail to happen, Germain would never recover the reputation he’d lost some 20 years before when he had been court-martialed for purportedly refusing a direct order.

As it turned out, Germain’s anxiety was justified. In 1781, it was his duty to deliver news of the American victory at Yorktown to the prime minister, Lord North, who cried out, “Oh God, it is all over!”

George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, the figure with whom almost everyone else directly connects. Cornplanter sought his help for the Senecas. Coghlan attended a dinner at which he was present and got his attention when she saucily refused to toast the American cause. Yates exchanged letters with him. Germain was his opponent, and, like Washington, a tall, imposing man who hid vast ambition behind a usually unreadable visage. Shorto captures this resemblance, as well as the noble demeanor that separated Washington from nearly everyone else.

But like many who have written about Washington, Shorto has difficulty describing the president’s inner life. As his soldiers became more professional, Shorto writes, Washington “found himself overcome with emotion, thrilling in his heart at the feeling that he was becoming one with them.” Such a description deserves an example — or at least a footnote. The same is true when Shorto writes that while living in New York as the new president, Washington felt like a “bumpkin.” Perhaps, but where is the proof?

Still, Shorto’s achievement is a remarkable one. The intertwined stories of “Revolution Song” give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was. It leaves to readers the pleasure of judging what each of the figures in the book — or perhaps the combination of them all — contributed to an event that changed the world.","The War of Independence, Seen Through Six Sets of Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/russell-shorto-revolution-song.html

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

This onslaught over issues of culture and identity, a mix of the Trumpian tactics of today with the unvarnished appeals from the past in a state defined by race since Jamestown, has appalled Democrats in Virginia and beyond.

The gut-punch approach has left even some Republicans wincing over the spectacle of a former Republican National Committee chairman and New Jersey native trying to win with earnest vows to guard emblems of the Lost Cause and with warnings about menacing Hispanic gangs.

Yet Mr. Gillespie’s strategy has brought him within a few points of Mr. Northam in both public and private polling. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Northam with just a three-point lead over Mr. Gillespie, 43 percent to 40 percent.

That has forced nervous Democrats to confront the reality that race, immigration and crime can be a potent mix even in a rapidly suburbanizing state where Hillary Clinton won by more than five points last year and where, overall, the president remains deeply unpopular.

“I don’t think it will work in Virginia, but I just don’t know,” said Representative Robert C. Scott, Virginia’s first black congressman since Reconstruction.

Democratic officials have been especially troubled as their ostensible allies have responded with ham-handed scare tactics of their own and demanded that their candidates reject any policies that carry even the whiff of Trumpism.

In an attempt to stir nonwhite voters, and draw attention from the news media and would-be donors, a liberal Hispanic advocacy group released an ad last week depicting a man in a pickup bearing a Gillespie sticker speeding after panicked children of color. The group, the Latino Victory Fund, pulled the commercial down after the deadly truck attack in New York, but not before offering Republicans a rallying cry to motivate their base and forcing Mr. Northam to distance himself from the spot.

At a get-out-the-vote rally Saturday for Mr. Gillespie and the Republican ticket in Fairfax County, a suburb of Washington that is Virginia’s most populous locality, speaker after speaker inveighed against the racially motivated ad, while avoiding any mention of their own standard-bearer’s appeals.

“It is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in politics,” said Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a fellow Republican who ventured across the Potomac for Mr. Gillespie.

While the displays of umbrage illustrated how desperate Republicans are to seize any opening, the dust-up illustrated the determination of some liberals to fight fire with fire, even if it creates a mess for their nominee.

“Will Rogers was never proven wrong,” said Mr. Scott, invoking Rogers’s oft-cited aphorism that, as a Democrat, he belonged to no organized party.

Also worrisome to Democratic strategists was how some elements of the left reacted when Mr. Northam indicated in an interview last week that he would sign a law banning sanctuary cities, localities that offer a blanket of protection from federal immigration authorities. One liberal group, Democracy for America, withdrew its support from Mr. Northam, and a founder of the “resistance” organization Indivisible implored the nominee, who is under fire from Mr. Gillespie for opposing a state measure that would have banned sanctuary cities, to “find your spine.”

The fratricide illustrated how, as Democrats become more organized around their own identity politics, it is growing ever more difficult for their candidates to stray from the liberal line on any issue that veers toward race.

And it was the second time Mr. Northam, a moderate by inclination, equivocated on a racially charged issue in an effort to satisfy liberals and more centrist voters: Earlier in the campaign he said he would lead the effort to take down Confederate statues, only to subsequently say he would defer to local authorities.

In an interview here on Saturday after he stopped at a bustling Asian food hall that featured Hawaiian-style poke bowls, Vietnamese coffee ice cream in ash coconut waffle cones and an ethnic fusion of voters to match, Mr. Northam demonstrated how tricky immigration politics is becoming for his party.

Asked whether those found to be in the country illegally should be deported at all, he repeated the question and then declined to say.

“That’s a federal issue,” said Mr. Northam, a former Army doctor who voted for George W. Bush twice before entering politics, adding that he would “support local law enforcement.”

Veteran Democrats hear such equivocation and see peril ahead.

“If the debate is set up so that Republicans are the only ones who want some sort of order or limitations on immigration and Democrats want zero, we will lose that debate every single day,” said Kenneth Baer, a Democratic strategist. “We need to say that immigration makes the country strong and is at the core of who we are, and this is how we do it: with order, laws and compassion. Unfortunately, Trump is boxing us into being the open borders party, which is not where most of the country is.”

It is unclear how much leeway on immigration the Democratic base will give its office holders. Mr. Northam’s most rousing applause lines have come when he has said that Virginia is a welcoming and inclusive state, whether it was when former President Barack Obama appeared in Richmond for a rally last month or when Mr. Northam addressed a group of Arlington County Democrats last week.

What ultimately may save Mr. Northam on Tuesday, though, was captured by another speaker in Arlington, among the most liberal jurisdictions in the state. “I don’t know about you, but the funk that I have been in since Nov. 8 of last year, it still hasn’t worn off,” said Christian Dorsey, a member of the County Board.

Virginia Democrats, especially in the Washington suburbs, view this election as an exercise in cathartic revenge against Mr. Trump. “Democrats want to send a message,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.

Mr. Gillespie is conscious of giving Democrats the chance to link him directly to Mr. Trump. At the sparsely attended Republican rally in Fairfax County on Saturday, not one speaker mentioned the president’s name. Nor did Mr. Gillespie say a word about the core of his advertising campaign, ignoring the MS-13 gang, felons’ rights and Confederate statues.

Afterward, George Allen, the former Republican governor and senator, noted that Mr. Trump was “off in Asia now.” Indeed, the only hint of the president came via a 20-foot, golden-maned inflatable chicken that Democrats had set up across the street to taunt Mr. Gillespie about his refusal to be seen with Mr. Trump.

But a table filled with the stickers and literature of Republican candidates offered a stark reminder of how Mr. Trump’s adopted party is embracing his politics: A door hanger ready for distribution presented a blurry picture of Mr. Northam and criticized him for backing a state proposal in favor of sanctuary cities, restoring rights to criminals and supporting “taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.”","Avoiding Trump, but Adopting His Divisive Playbook: Will It Work in Virginia?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/virginia-governor-northam-gillespie-race.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

But its deep entanglements with slavery did not.

“Princeton’s history is American history writ small,” said Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the project. “From the beginning, liberty and slavery were intertwined.”

The Princeton research is being released amid renewed debate about slavery, the Civil War and national memory. It also arrives nearly two years after a student group at Princeton called the Black Justice League occupied the president’s office and demanded, among other things, that Woodrow Wilson’s name be removed from places of honor on campus because of his racist ideas and actions.

Wilson, a Princeton graduate and former president of the university, kept his place, and that controversy quieted down. The new research does not come with any recommendations for action. But Professor Sandweiss said she hoped it would foster a broader, more fully informed conversation about history and racial justice.

“Woodrow Wilson doesn’t just come from nowhere, “ she said. “He comes from this particular place.”

Unlike slavery research at some other institutions, the Princeton project was a bottom-up affair, originating with an undergraduate class that Professor Sandweiss began teaching in 2013, with help from the university’s archivist, Dan Linke. Early on, she told the administration what she was doing and said she didn’t think it would be “embarrassing to Princeton,” she recalled.

As the project grew, it was supported piecemeal by various partners, including the university’s art museum, which has commissioned a large-scale outdoor installation by the artist Titus Kaphar commemorating the 1766 slave sale, and the McCarter Theater, which has commissioned seven plays inspired by the research, to be performed later this month as part of a two-day public symposium.

[ Playwrights on putting the ghosts of Princeton’s racial past onstage ]

Earlier this year, the project got more formal support from the administration, in the form of a grant from the Princeton Histories Fund, established in the wake of the Wilson controversy to support “aspects of Princeton’s history that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated or suppressed.”

Princeton’s current president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, who will speak at the symposium, issued a statement praising the project’s “creativity, diverse perspectives and rigorous academic standards,” which he said he hoped would promote “a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of our history.”

That history is certainly imposing. Princeton, founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, is the nation’s fourth-oldest university, and the one most associated with the American Revolution. Its sixth president, John Witherspoon, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1783, the Continental Congress briefly met in Nassau Hall, in the same room where campus lore holds that a cannonball (fired by Alexander Hamilton, no less) decapitated a portrait of George III six years earlier.

Today, that room is lined with oil portraits of the university’s presidents, the first nine of whom owned slaves. (The researchers found no evidence that the university itself ever owned slaves.) On a recent morning, Professor Sandweiss paused in front of the likeness of Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751-1819).

Smith, a Presbyterian minister, helped inspire the colonization movement, which advocated resettling freed slaves in Africa. (Many leading colonization advocates, the researchers discovered, had Princeton connections.)

But at a time when many educated whites believed that blacks had separate evolutionary origins, Smith also argued that racial differences were purely due to environment, and even advocated interracial marriage.

“Historians are fond of going around saying, ‘It’s complicated,’” Professor Sandweiss said. “But it is complicated.”

Professor Sandweiss’s team, which included some 30 students and two full-time postdoctoral fellows, Craig Hollander and Joseph Yannielli, looked at subjects familiar from studies at other universities, like slavery-related donations and slave ownership among professors, including one who owned a slave as late as 1840.

But they also zeroed in on one of the distinctive, and fateful, aspects of Princeton’s history: its heavily Southern student body.

In the archives, they found evidence of early administrators’ eagerness to recruit students from the South. To nail down some hard data, a dozen graduate students gathered in the archives one night and, with the cast album of “Hamilton” blaring, tracked down the places of origin for more than 2,000 names in their database of pre-Civil War students.

Roughly 40 percent of students from the college’s founding until 1861, the researchers determined, came from the slaveholding South, with the figure spiking at two-thirds in the early 1850s. (The figure for Harvard and Yale at that time was about 9 percent.) And as slavery moved southwest, a heat map on the website shows, so too did the student body.

“Princeton had more students from Mississippi in the decades before the Civil War than it does today,” Professor Sandweiss said.

This fact heavily influenced the culture at Princeton, which became more conservative as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.

In town, Southern students (as well as many Northern ones) encountered something unfamiliar: a proud, and longstanding, free black community. But inside the campus gates, the university was maintained as a safe space for the sons of slaveholders.

Unlike at Harvard and Yale, abolitionists were generally not invited to speak on campus. And when they did show up, violence sometimes ensued. In 1835, a gang of students descended on the town’s African-American neighborhood in an attempt to lynch a white agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society who had come to address a secret meeting. (Researchers found no records of any attempts to discipline those students.)

The next year, at commencement, a white student from South Carolina attacked a black abolitionist minister, Theodore Sedgwick Wright, shouting a racial slur. The university’s president, James Carnahan, a onetime slaveholder, published a letter denying that the attacker was a Princeton student or that any actual violence had occurred, and blaming Wright for the disturbance.

But Princeton’s compromise over slavery, like the nation’s, didn’t hold forever. In the university’s archives, R. Isabela Morales, a graduate student, found an 1846 diary in which a student from Mississippi described going out with other “Southern bloods” to hunt down a local black man they had scuffled with and “try him in the worshipful court of Judge Lynch.”

Another group of students, led by John Maclean Jr., a professor who later became Princeton’s first nonslaveholding president, mustered to try and stop them. The man was still “whipped within an inch of his life,” the diarist exulted, “to the silent Satisfaction of all the arrayed collegians from the South!”

“Princeton had a reputation as this moderate place, where Northerners and Southerners got along,” Ms. Morales said. “But here, 15 years before the Civil War, you have them dividing along battle lines to fight over the question of race.”

As Southern states began seceding, southern students began leaving campus. In student autograph books, Ms. Sandweiss’s team found poignant inscriptions traded by friends who would soon meet on the battlefield. “Basically, they’re going off to kill their roommates,” Professor Sandweiss said.

The researchers have yet to figure out just when southern students (like the Virginia-born Wilson, class of 1879), started coming back after the Civil War, and in what numbers. But the instinct to keep the sectional peace reasserted itself.

An article on the website tells the story of the Civil War memorial carved on a wall just inside Nassau Hall in the 1920s — the only one anywhere in the country, Professor Sandweiss said, to give no indication of which cause the names inscribed there fought for.

The initial plan was to group them by side. But the university’s president at the time, John Grier Hibben, overruled it, saying “no one shall know on which side these young men fought.”

On today’s campuses, the battles are often fought over monuments themselves. One of the new plays commissioned for the project, by Nathan Alan Davis, features a rawly funny dialogue between a statue of John Witherspoon, Princeton’s slave-owning Revolutionary War-era president, and a contemporary African-American student armed with a blowtorch.

As part of the aftermath of the Wilson controversy, Princeton is already discussing ways to make its iconography more reflective of its current diversity.

“If you walk around campus, you see a lot of dead white men,” Professor Sandweiss said. “That’s not untrue to our history, but it is deeply untrue to what Princeton has worked hard to become in the past few decades.”

With Iran, which is largely Shiite, and Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, each trying to assert dominance over the Middle East, Yemen has emerged as a battleground.

With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since. The fighting has led to an immense humanitarian crisis — the United Nations has described it as the world’s worst — in which 10,000 people have died and at least three million have been displaced.

The latest step in the conflict came on Saturday, when a ballistic missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being intercepted by the Saudi military. Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile.

Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit the Yemeni capital, Sana, with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.

While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the “direct command” of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say.

It is unclear whether Tehran has sent, or even could send, missiles to Yemen, which is under a tightly controlled air and sea blockade. In recent years, ships believed to be from Iran have been intercepted transporting small weapons, but there have been no reports involving missiles or missile parts.

The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran denied that his country had provided the rebels in Yemen with missiles, describing the accusation as “baseless.”

“It is not possible for the Islamic Republic to transfer missiles to Yemen,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim. “These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry.”

The Houthis’ emerging use of ballistic missiles nevertheless suggests there is some merit to allegations from Saudi Arabia, the United States and Israel that Iran is providing parts or technology. Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.

Saudi Arabia has set up a sea blockade around Yemen, assisted by others, including the United States Navy. The kingdom has also bought hundreds of billions of dollars of advanced weapons and bombs from the United States and Britain.

Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the notion that his country was involved in the attack on Riyadh. “The people of Yemen are defending themselves,” he said.

He also pointed to Saudi Arabia’s deals with Washington and London for arms being used in Yemen. “Today, we should ask Saudi Arabia under what pretext it has been attacking Yemen with all its equipment from air, land and sea,” he said.

On Sunday, in addition to shutting down Yemen’s points of entry, the Saudi-led coalition announced bounties for 40 members of the Houthi leadership, ranging from $20 million to $40 million each, describing the targets as “terrorists.” Most of the people on the list were members of the government that had been formed with the party of the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.

Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.

Separately, state television in Iran reported that Tehran and Riyadh had been unable to work out an arrangement that would allow Iranians to travel to Saudi Arabia for umrah, a minor pilgrimage that can be made at any time of the year. The major hajj pilgrimage, in contrast, is defined by specific dates on the Islamic lunar calendar.

There was no indication that the failure to reach an accord was linked to the developments in Lebanon and Yemen.

The Iranian news agency ISNA quoted Hamid Mohammadi, who leads the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization in Tehran, as saying that Iran and Saudi Arabia would hold talks in December for hajj travel next year.

No Iranians are thought to have traveled to the holy Saudi city of Mecca for the hajj in 2016 because of tensions between the two countries. A year earlier, thousands of pilgrims, including 464 Iranians, died in a stampede there, prompting Iranian leaders to accuse the Saudis of mismanaging the holy sites. An agreement was later reached to allow Iranians to travel to Mecca this year.",Saudi-Led Coalition Fighting in Yemen Hints at ‘Act of War’ by Iran,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-iran-missile.html

This onslaught over issues of culture and identity, a mix of the Trumpian tactics of today with the unvarnished appeals from the past in a state defined by race since Jamestown, has appalled Democrats in Virginia and beyond.

The gut-punch approach has left even some Republicans wincing over the spectacle of a former Republican National Committee chairman and New Jersey native trying to win with earnest vows to guard emblems of the Lost Cause and with warnings about menacing Hispanic gangs.

Yet Mr. Gillespie’s strategy has brought him within a few points of Mr. Northam in both public and private polling. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Northam with just a three-point lead over Mr. Gillespie, 43 percent to 40 percent.

That has forced nervous Democrats to confront the reality that race, immigration and crime can be a potent mix even in a rapidly suburbanizing state where Hillary Clinton won by more than five points last year and where, overall, the president remains deeply unpopular.

“I don’t think it will work in Virginia, but I just don’t know,” said Representative Robert C. Scott, Virginia’s first black congressman since Reconstruction.

Democratic officials have been especially troubled as their ostensible allies have responded with ham-handed scare tactics of their own and demanded that their candidates reject any policies that carry even the whiff of Trumpism.

In an attempt to stir nonwhite voters, and draw attention from the news media and would-be donors, a liberal Hispanic advocacy group released an ad last week depicting a man in a pickup bearing a Gillespie sticker speeding after panicked children of color. The group, the Latino Victory Fund, pulled the commercial down after the deadly truck attack in New York, but not before offering Republicans a rallying cry to motivate their base and forcing Mr. Northam to distance himself from the spot.

At a get-out-the-vote rally Saturday for Mr. Gillespie and the Republican ticket in Fairfax County, a suburb of Washington that is Virginia’s most populous locality, speaker after speaker inveighed against the racially motivated ad, while avoiding any mention of their own standard-bearer’s appeals.

“It is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in politics,” said Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a fellow Republican who ventured across the Potomac for Mr. Gillespie.

While the displays of umbrage illustrated how desperate Republicans are to seize any opening, the dust-up illustrated the determination of some liberals to fight fire with fire, even if it creates a mess for their nominee.

“Will Rogers was never proven wrong,” said Mr. Scott, invoking Rogers’s oft-cited aphorism that, as a Democrat, he belonged to no organized party.

Also worrisome to Democratic strategists was how some elements of the left reacted when Mr. Northam indicated in an interview last week that he would sign a law banning sanctuary cities, localities that offer a blanket of protection from federal immigration authorities. One liberal group, Democracy for America, withdrew its support from Mr. Northam, and a founder of the “resistance” organization Indivisible implored the nominee, who is under fire from Mr. Gillespie for opposing a state measure that would have banned sanctuary cities, to “find your spine.”

The fratricide illustrated how, as Democrats become more organized around their own identity politics, it is growing ever more difficult for their candidates to stray from the liberal line on any issue that veers toward race.

And it was the second time Mr. Northam, a moderate by inclination, equivocated on a racially charged issue in an effort to satisfy liberals and more centrist voters: Earlier in the campaign he said he would lead the effort to take down Confederate statues, only to subsequently say he would defer to local authorities.

In an interview here on Saturday after he stopped at a bustling Asian food hall that featured Hawaiian-style poke bowls, Vietnamese coffee ice cream in ash coconut waffle cones and an ethnic fusion of voters to match, Mr. Northam demonstrated how tricky immigration politics is becoming for his party.

Asked whether those found to be in the country illegally should be deported at all, he repeated the question and then declined to say.

“That’s a federal issue,” said Mr. Northam, a former Army doctor who voted for George W. Bush twice before entering politics, adding that he would “support local law enforcement.”

Veteran Democrats hear such equivocation and see peril ahead.

“If the debate is set up so that Republicans are the only ones who want some sort of order or limitations on immigration and Democrats want zero, we will lose that debate every single day,” said Kenneth Baer, a Democratic strategist. “We need to say that immigration makes the country strong and is at the core of who we are, and this is how we do it: with order, laws and compassion. Unfortunately, Trump is boxing us into being the open borders party, which is not where most of the country is.”

It is unclear how much leeway on immigration the Democratic base will give its office holders. Mr. Northam’s most rousing applause lines have come when he has said that Virginia is a welcoming and inclusive state, whether it was when former President Barack Obama appeared in Richmond for a rally last month or when Mr. Northam addressed a group of Arlington County Democrats last week.

What ultimately may save Mr. Northam on Tuesday, though, was captured by another speaker in Arlington, among the most liberal jurisdictions in the state. “I don’t know about you, but the funk that I have been in since Nov. 8 of last year, it still hasn’t worn off,” said Christian Dorsey, a member of the County Board.

Virginia Democrats, especially in the Washington suburbs, view this election as an exercise in cathartic revenge against Mr. Trump. “Democrats want to send a message,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.

Mr. Gillespie is conscious of giving Democrats the chance to link him directly to Mr. Trump. At the sparsely attended Republican rally in Fairfax County on Saturday, not one speaker mentioned the president’s name. Nor did Mr. Gillespie say a word about the core of his advertising campaign, ignoring the MS-13 gang, felons’ rights and Confederate statues.

Afterward, George Allen, the former Republican governor and senator, noted that Mr. Trump was “off in Asia now.” Indeed, the only hint of the president came via a 20-foot, golden-maned inflatable chicken that Democrats had set up across the street to taunt Mr. Gillespie about his refusal to be seen with Mr. Trump.

But a table filled with the stickers and literature of Republican candidates offered a stark reminder of how Mr. Trump’s adopted party is embracing his politics: A door hanger ready for distribution presented a blurry picture of Mr. Northam and criticized him for backing a state proposal in favor of sanctuary cities, restoring rights to criminals and supporting “taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.”","Avoiding Trump, but Adopting His Divisive Playbook: Will It Work in Virginia?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/virginia-governor-northam-gillespie-race.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And in “Uncommon Sense,” Andrew Duff, the actor who plays Moose, has a diagnosis of autism too.

Still, it can be difficult to find ways to tell the stories of nonverbal characters like Moose and Lali authentically, when even their parents don’t know what those stories are.

Mr. Paris and Ms. Paris-Carter, a couple with a family member on the spectrum, get around that problem by packing as much variety into their narrative as a 100-minute show will allow. As members of Tectonic Theater Project, they are expert mosaicists, comfortable with the process of research and montage that produced earlier Tectonic docu-plays like “The Laramie Project.” Though fiction, “Uncommon Sense” was developed over several years of investigation with “autism families” in Northern Iowa and elsewhere.

The result can sometimes feel too programmatic. Putting across so many medical factoids and bits of real stories has the paradoxical effect of diminishing a sense of emotional truth. You can almost count the items on a worthy checklist being addressed, one by one, in the intercut vignettes: safety, sexuality, employability, the push-pull of independence. But with their exceptional and sometimes opaque traits, Moose and Lali and Dan and Jess, who are composites, never cohere as characters.

Or perhaps that’s just the perspective of a neurotypical observer — a perspective that the play implicitly asks us to question. When the sound of silverware being sorted makes Moose scream, “Uncommon Sense” helps us understand his discomfort by having us hear an avalanche of grating metal. (The sound design is by Stephanie Robinson.) When Jess reacts painfully to the fluorescent lighting “vibration” that a classmate doesn’t even notice, she seriously asks him, “What’s wrong with you?” One person’s disability is another’s exceptional awareness.

Even so, I suspect that most audience members who don’t live with autism will have an easier time connecting to the stories of the parents, whose highest hopes for their children begin where the depths of other parents’ despair might end. Lali’s mother, afraid that she will never be more than “a thing” to her daughter, dreams of a day when the girl might somehow be able to say, as other children do, whatever is on her mind. Spoiler alert: Be careful what you wish for.

And Moose’s parents must in the course of the play contend with the likelihood that their son’s abilities may never improve. What kind of life will he have, and how much of their own lives can they sacrifice to provide it? By serving, in effect, as his brain in the world, are they preventing him from achieving whatever growth is possible? Would he be happier in an institution? What would “happier” mean?

In the context of these racking questions, many of the play’s comic devices, no doubt intended to balance the pathos, seem labored. (Dan, on a first date, licks a young woman’s feet as a cat might.) Strangely for a work about difference, the shape of the storytelling tends toward the conventional. Yet when uncomfortable scenes are allowed to develop naturally — such as those in which Jess tries to manage a flirtation with the classmate she’s tutoring — real comedy, mixed with sadness, emerges.

If “Uncommon Sense” had less of an overview in mind, it might have focused more profitably on this or any one of its other stories. As it is, under Mr. Paris’s sometimes inventive but sometimes awkward direction, on a cramped multi-platform set by John Coyne, there is too much information pressing in from all sides. Neither the eye nor the mind is comfortable anywhere.

When Jason Lalli tore his left anterior cruciate ligament at age 26, he thought he would be fine as soon as he had his knee repaired. As a soccer player who competed through college and then on recreational teams, he knew that A.C.L. injuries could be debilitating but also that orthopedists could fix them.

He figured that he would miss a season, but that he could play and coach the game he loved for the rest of his life.

Four years later, his knee began to ache, and the pain became more constant over time, nagging almost “like a toothache,” he said. Within about another year, Lalli’s doctor did more work on the knee and gave him bad news: He had arthritis.

And, Lalli eventually learned, it was almost predictable.

Orthopedists have believed for years that torn tendons or ligaments put patients, no matter how young, at risk for arthritis. But quantifying the long-term risk has been difficult because most orthopedic patients are not studied for extended periods after their injuries.

Dr. Mininder Kocher, an orthopedics professor at Harvard Medical School, has reviewed the available data and determined that the chance of getting arthritis within a decade of tearing a tendon or a ligament in the knee is greater than 50 percent.

Lalli, now 39 and a resident of Canonsburg, Pa., is hobbled by knee pain. He gave up soccer. Then he had to give up running. He has tried swimming and cycling, but he said, “My heart is not in it.” Some days he can barely walk.

And he has no memory of any doctor warning him that he could get arthritis.

“It’s like a dirty little secret,” said Kocher, who is also the associate director of the division of sports medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital. “It’s not that anyone is covering up. It’s just that it’s not well known.”

But as someone who spends his days repairing torn knee ligaments in teenagers, he is worried. He has written a paper, soon to be published, that says the number of A.C.L. operations at 26 children’s hospitals in the United States has soared as more children and adolescents play sports that involve twisting the knee, like soccer and basketball, and often participate year-round.

In 2004, there were about 500 A.C.L. operations at those hospitals; in 2014, there were more than 2,500, he reports.

“This is a major issue for me,” said Kocher, who does more than 150 A.C.L. reconstructions a year, mostly in adolescents. “If a 15-year-old gets arthritis in 10 years, knee replacement is not a great option at age 25.”

One of the few long-term studies was done carried out by Britt Elin Oiestad, a physical therapy researcher at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, who followed 181 people for 10 to 15 years after A.C.L. surgery. Seventy-four percent developed arthritis that could be seen on X-rays. Some of those patients had yet to feel arthritic pain; 41 percent of those studied had reported knee pain that indicated arthritis.



“It’s scary,” Oiestad said.

While knee injuries have received the most attention in research on arthritis risk, other joints are not immune, said Dr. Brett Owens, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Brown University Alpert Medical School. People who repeatedly sprain an ankle are at risk, he said. And up to 40 percent of those who dislocate a shoulder get arthritis within about 15 years, he said.

What researchers want to know is this: Why do these injuries precipitate arthritis?

Is the answer a bone bruise that injures cartilage? Chemical changes that happen as the body tries to repair the injury? An intrinsic instability of the knee?

And would surgical methods that more closely reproduce an individual’s original knee anatomy reduce the risk?

Research is not definitive but seems to support all of the hypotheses, as well as a strong hunch among investigators that there are genetic factors . Owens mentioned “A.C.L. families,” explaining, “I have operated on multiple siblings in a family.”

Doctors say they struggle with telling adolescents who just tore an A.C.L. that arthritis might follow. Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.

“Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”

Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.

Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.

Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.

Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.

Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.

A person can have only two or three knee replacements in a lifetime, Fu told Lalli, and so it was best to wait until he was 50.

Now Lalli is trying to decide whether to let his children play soccer. He has a 5-year-old and 3-year-old twins, and he said they “seem to naturally gravitate toward soccer.”

Lalli, who loves the sport, is torn and has been talking it over with his wife.

“I’m not sure what we will do,” he said.

The 98 specimens that the team had analyzed came from across the northern part of Siberia and had been collected over the course of four decades. The oldest were more than 60,000 years old, and the youngest, a specimen known as “Lonely Boy,” was about 4,000 years old. The genetic data did not provide insight into how old the mammoths were when they died, only their sex.

To obtain the DNA, the team first had to limit contamination. For that, they worked in a clean laboratory and wore lab suits similar to what Ebola doctors wear. They shaved off a few millimeters from the surface of their samples and then drilled into them to extract genetic data. They found that 66 were males and 29 were females.

The biggest limitation in the study is that their explanation for the skew is speculative and based mostly on the behavior of present-day elephants. The thought is that mammoths, like today’s elephants, lived in matriarchal societies where adult females protected the young. But around the ages of 14 or 15 when puberty set in, males left their herd and either became loners or joined bachelor groups, which were often led by inexperienced males. That was when they were more likely to do something risky, and find themselves stuck in frozen muck.

The natural traps buried their bodies quickly, protecting them from scavengers. The researchers said that their findings say nothing about the sex ratio of mammoths when they were alive, which they think may have been 50-50, only that males were more likely to die in ways that kept their remains preserved for thousands of years.

Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, said she was surprised by the results and that the team’s hypothesis was sensible given what we know about elephant behavior. She added that it would be interesting to see if there is a sex ratio difference for other prehistoric mammals preserved in the permafrost, like bison and horses.

Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, said the hypothesis was well-founded, but that tusks should not have been used in the study because males often broke their tusks while fighting each other, but that did not mean they died.

The authors said that even discounting their tusk fragments and only using teeth, bone and hair samples, they still had more dead males.","Male Mammoths Died in ‘Silly Ways’ More Often Than Females, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/mammoth-fossils-males.html

Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

For a company like Subaru, with a brand image of being outdoors, dependable, inclusive and kind, those metrics help attract great employees. They also help the company’s marketing campaign.

The numbers are so important, in fact, that Sandy Capell, the philanthropy and corporate responsibility manager for the company and the Subaru of America Foundation, said she had turned to a software system to track employees who volunteered, tally their time and measure the impact of what they’re doing.

“The software puts the efforts in perspective,” Ms. Capell said. “We used to report hours and nothing else. After awhile it loses impact. Now we’re able to put a true impact on those hours.”

To do that, Subaru reached out to Blackbaud, a cloud software company that measures the effect of philanthropic efforts.

“They come to us, and to the market in general, because they want to tell their impact story to individuals,” said Kevin McDearis, executive vice president and chief products officer at Blackbaud. “They realize part of this is about building their brand and enhancing their brand.”

That marketing may also mean as much to employees as to consumers. “It’s getting to be a very competitive market out there, and people will pick a job, and maybe not the highest paid offer, if they feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves,” he said.

In a study by CECP, which promotes corporate philanthropy, and the Conference Board this year, a third of employees, on average, participated in corporate volunteerism, and nearly two-third of companies offered paid time off for volunteering.

But there is no room to fake it. A study on corporate social responsibility found that 65 percent of consumers check to see if a company is being authentic when it takes a stand on a social or environmental issue. That number rises to 76 percent for millennials.

The study also found that 78 percent of respondents wanted companies to take a stand. That’s a double-edge sword in a polarized time. While 87 percent of the people in the study said they would buy a product because of something the company advocated, 76 percent said they would not buy a product from a company they did not agree with.

“Everyone loves to feed the hungry and house the homeless,” Mr. McDearis said. But companies taking a stand can also “drive some interesting polarization.”

In the case of Subaru, it chose well-known, noncontroversial charities, like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Meals On Wheels.

Money for these charities comes through the company’s Share the Love campaign, in which it donates $250 from each vehicle bought or leased to various charities. (In nine years, the company said it had given $94 million to charity.

Ms. Capell said employees had volunteering goals each year, but that the company did not dictate where they could give their time. The hours get logged, and they get credit for them.

However, if employees want to volunteer during the workday, they choose among events the company has organized, like Habitat for Humanity. She said about 1,000 employees gave 5,100 hours last year. And this is where impact measurement comes in.

Many companies are turning to their own consumers to drive their giving.

Discovery Communications began a program in July to protect wild tigers by conserving land for them. The company, which produces programs like “Shark Week,” “Deadliest Catch” and “American Chopper,” aims to double the tiger population by 2022. It now stands at 4,000, compared with 400,000 for elephants.

“Tigers are apex predators,” said Jessica Beatus, vice president of standards, practices and social good at Discovery Communications and the creator and program director of Project CAT, which stands for conserving acres for tigers.

“When you support them, you support their entire ecosystem,” she said. “If you have too many prey, you have destruction of the habitat.”

She said the company had committed to support one million acres in India and Bhutan over six years.

The company is looking to use impact metrics to see where viewers are most interested in this campaign. “When we run a public-service announcement, does that translate to countries donating?” she said. “That was a big factor. Do people want to adopt a symbolic tiger? How many people participated? These campaigns are only as successful as you market them.”

And they do not all work. The company tested a similar donation scheme to help sharks in conjunction with “Shark Week.” “It didn’t have as many hits,” she said. “People go to the beach and hope not to see a shark.”

Other companies are offering customers what could be called a release valve for their giving. Last year, Evite, the online invitation service, created a system where people could give respondents a way to contribute to charities instead of bringing a gift to the party.

“We literally had a birthday party for my 4-year-old, and there was a stack of 30 presents that sat for probably a year,” said Victor Cho, chief executive of Evite. “She opened a few. But then we asked her why she didn’t open all of them. She said, ‘If I open it you’re going to make me write a thank you card’.”

Mr. Cho said that in less than two years of the charity option existing, the company would hit $5 million in donations. People can choose from 150,000 registered charities. “It’s not for everyone in the world, but the idea was if it’s gift 30 on top of other presents, let’s direct that consumer spending to a cause.”

The Evite and Discovery efforts are supported by Pledgeling, which allows companies to set up charity pages and track their impact.

“Cause marketing and corporate social responsibility are buzzwords that are web 2.0,” said James Citron, chief executive of Pledgeling. “The power of impact is to integrate charity into what you’re doing and track the” key performance indicators.

He said Pledgeling’s strategy is about, “What are you actually doing, and tell your customers the impact you’re having.”

The company charges a fee for its service, but generally 97 percent of the money raised goes to the charity. The company also can track what and how the campaign is doing.

There is yet another way for companies to have measurable impact. Companies like Warby Parker, which makes eyeglasses, and Toms, the shoe company, are pioneers among so-called give-back companies. Buy a pair of glasses or shoes, and they will give a pair to someone in need.

In terms of measuring the impact, the tracking is fairly easy because it is generally one to one. It is simple for the company to do and simple for the individual to understand.

Not all companies that want to do this have it so easy. A new subscription yoga clothes company, YogaClub, wanted to incorporate this giveback model.

Just one problem: giving fancy yoga clothes to needy children is not the same feel-good story as giving them a pair of shoes so they can walk to school or eyeglasses so they can read and learn.

So the company came up with a different plan. Its box of yoga clothes, which cost from $49 to $79 a shipment,arrive monthly or quarterly like a wine club: You pick the quantity, and the company decides what you get. For every box purchased, YogaClub donates one yoga class to a student from a disadvantaged school in Los Angeles.

Since July, the company said it had donated over 163,000 yoga classes to elementary school children in Los Angeles. “It’s teaching the fundamentals of how you use yoga and meditation to teach the kids how to deal with the stresses in their lives,” said Lindsay McClelland, director of partnership and brand experience at the company.

“It makes our customers feel good,” she added. “They can see their purchase isn’t just getting their two yoga pants. It’s having an impact in the community.”","Firms Learn That as They Help Charities, They Also Help Their Brands",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/corporate-philanthropy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Is she innocent, guilty, crazy? “Alias Grace” is less about finding the definitive truth than watching Grace feel her way to the answer that could save her.

“Alias Grace” is a story about storytelling — one character compares Grace with Scheherazade — which makes Ms. Gadon essential to its success. She is mesmerizing. She plays Grace convincingly as a timid child and a toughened inmate, and she brings both of them to Grace’s wary testimony.

The novel by Ms. Atwood (who has a bit part as “Disapproving Woman”) is a challenge to adapt visually. It’s as internal and retrospective as “Handmaid’s” is propulsive, though both protagonists are slyly defiant. The screenwriter, Sarah Polley (who adapted a story from the Canadian author Alice Munro into the film “Away from Her”), turns it into a sinuous, layered script that is constantly aware of what is being said, to whom and why.

Mary Harron (“I Shot Andy Warhol”) directs the series dynamically. In an early sequence, Grace’s meditates on the curious phrase “celebrated murderess” over quick cuts of the crime — a body tumbling to the floor, a strip of cloth tightening around a throat.

For all that, “Alias Grace” isn’t overly brutal. It’s an exquisitely woven fabric with blood staining the corners. The violence is often in the language, as when a servant woman describes a death scene — the result of an illegal abortion — as smelling like a butcher shop.

You could almost mistake the series for a nostalgic period piece, as when a bushy-bearded Zachary Levi (“Chuck”) enters as a silver-tongued peddler, or when Grace befriends Mary (Rebecca Liddiard), a feisty, politically aware servant who fatefully attracts the interest of one of her employer’s sons. (The series follows Netflix’s roughed-up “Anne With an E,” which surfaced the dark subtext of “Anne of Green Gables,” another story of 19th-century Canadian girlhood.)

The series is conscious of class — there’s a little primer on colonial Canadian populism — and of how patriarchy pits women against women, like Nancy Montgomery (Ms. Paquin), the housekeeper and jealous lover of Grace’s employer, who terrorizes the staff below her.

Above all, “Alias Grace” is about how men abuse power over women, and how that power is always present, even when the men aren’t. It’s present in something as innocuous as a wedding quilt, which Grace likens to a battle flag. A bed may seem like a place of rest, she tells Dr. Jordan, but “there are many dangerous things that need take place on a bed.”

It’s tempting to think of this series, like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” as especially timely, with today’s revelations of sexual abuse in places of power. But to say that would suggest that there have been moments when these ideas would not be timely.

That doesn’t seem to be the message of the Year of Atwood, with “Grace” and “Handmaid” standing like beacons centuries apart. Look back on the calendar, they say, and look forward. The year changes.

Neighborhood meetings organized by newly trained “neighborhood coordination officers” are sparsely attended in many cases, and sometimes not attended at all.

Specialized units tasked with addressing crime, known as conditions teams, are being scuttled in favor of these groups of neighborhood-based officers.","Even opponents grant him a kind of grudging respect. The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, declined to endorse the mayor for re-election, but, tellingly, it did not endorse any of his opponents, either.

Now, with violent crime on the rise in some of the country’s largest cities and President Trump apparently encouraging police aggression, Mr. de Blasio is hoping to make his mark on public safety in New York City and beyond with a policing experiment on a massive scale — to make officers nicer.

Among the ways to see how the effort is working is to spend time with the officers who are trying to execute it, and the people in the city’s neighborhoods with whom they are trying to connect. So far, the record has been mixed and mostly anecdotal.

Mr. de Blasio has promoted two prongs of this approach to local and national audiences: officers engaging in deeper outreach with residents and, at the same time, looking inward to the internal biases they maintain. The mayor is convinced that the crime numbers and a declining number of official citizen complaints about the police prove that the changes have already taken hold.

“We’re bringing into this city neighborhood policing, real neighborhood policing, cops walking the beat again,” he said in a 2016 television interview in Philadelphia, with the stage of the Democratic National Convention behind him. “One thing that’s crucially important is implicit bias training. Helping our police understand, like every human being, they have biases that we can overcome.”

On the ground, however, things look different than how they have been portrayed by the mayor. Officers do not walk a beat and are not expected to. Neighborhood meetings organized by newly trained “neighborhood coordination officers” are sparsely attended in many cases, and sometimes not attended at all. Firm metrics do not exist for measuring the new approach, which city officials call neighborhood policing and not community policing, which for some officers carries a stigma of laxity and past failure.

And despite Mr. de Blasio’s promise nearly two years ago in his State of the City address to begin implicit bias training for officers that spring, and repeated invocations of the idea since then, the Police Department has yet to train a single officer. A $4.5 million contract for the training is still being completed.

“We have implicit bias training now as part of our curriculum,” the mayor said in July 2016. Last month in a conversation with students at Columbia University, Mr. de Blasio conceded that it had still not yet begun. “We’re starting implicit bias training soon,” he said.

A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, Austin Finan, said the department tried to start the training internally before turning to outside help.

A New ‘Philosophy’

The slow beginnings contrasted with swift and sweeping changes that the Police Department has undertaken to carry out the new patrolling plan.

Fifty-one of the city’s 77 precincts have been carved into new subsections where patrol officers spend all their time. Specialized units tasked with addressing crime, known as conditions teams, are being scuttled in favor of these groups of neighborhood-based officers. Arrests are not only declining, they are being played down by supervisors and chiefs. At crime-trend meetings in Police Headquarters, numbers are out; explanations of how community concerns are being addressed are in.

“For the commanders, they were worried,” said Chief of Patrol Terence A. Monahan, who oversees the effort, which he calls an overarching new “philosophy,” more than a single program. “It took a little pushing to get this going. But they saw the results.”

The Police Department added hundreds of counterterrorism officers under Mr. de Blasio, a priority at a time when Paris, London and last week, New York, have been targets of attacks involving trucks.

How much the drop this year can be attributed to the new approach is unknown. Citywide, the seven major felony crimes — murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny and auto theft — tracked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined by nearly 6 percent.

An analysis of precinct-by-precinct crime data through Oct. 22 by The New York Times showed that those with the program — anywhere from a few months to more than two years — saw declines of nearly 7 percent; those without declined more slowly, a little over 4 percent. Yet at the same time, crime has increased in some of the first neighborhoods to get the program, including in parts of the northern Bronx and Washington Heights.

Even less certain is whether the new approach, meant as a lasting balm for minority neighborhoods rattled by decades of harsh policing tactics, will heal the rifts that reopened in 2014 with the police killing of Eric Garner on Staten Island and the national protests over similar killings of unarmed black men by officers in Baltimore, Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere.

“That’s sort of like the secret ingredient in McDonald’s or something,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national group. “The magic sauce, you know, ‘build trust,’ like, if we could figure out how to do that it would be like the Manhattan Project. How do you build trust?”

Complaints by citizens, often proportional to police enforcement activity, are down from four years ago, as are stop-and-frisk encounters, summonses and arrests.

Chief Monahan said overall arrests were falling faster in precincts with the new program.

Meeting With Residents

That would not surprise Detective Edwin A. Rodriguez, a neighborhood-based officer. Part of his strategy for gaining trust in areas of Washington Heights is to let some crimes go unpunished. In one instance, he let a marijuana dealer go, and later that dealer helped with information on gangs.

“He’s up there selling weed and stuff, a bunch of small stuff,” he said before heading out on patrol on a Friday last month. “And we’re worried about violent stuff.”

Over the summer, a new phase of the plan began around the city: small neighborhood meetings, often with coffee and cupcakes, aimed at helping officers learn the crime concerns in their small patrol areas, known as sectors.

Local commanders are not present, as they would be at the traditional precinct community council meetings. The meetings are run by the neighborhood-based officers, not supervisors.

In the basement of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in the northern Bronx on a recent Thursday night, an officer brought pizzas. His colleagues wrote the concerns of residents on a white sketch pad.

A man stood to complain about drug use in a playground. Others spoke of unlicensed cabs and double-parked cars. But the officers perked up as a woman described a problem at a business.

“They put their drugs right there in the Chinese place, I can tell you that,” the woman said, one of 17 mostly older residents who came to the church. “I’m not trying to get my name involved,” she added.

“Let’s talk after,” one officer, Detective Alejandro Colon, told her, before turning to the group. “This is what this program is all about.”

But not all meetings are as active. In more than a dozen visited by The Times over the last few months, several were sparsely attended, one in Harlem included no one from the area and another in Washington Heights, listed on the website for a June evening, did not take place.

“I was going to speak my mind,” said Orlando Ramos, 69, a retired doorman who was outside the designated location.

By contrast, more than 40 people at a meeting in Bedford-Stuyvesant told officers about problem spots, and officers explained, in an informal way, the challenges they face: the legal rules of stop-question-and-frisk; the limitations of stopping people from smoking marijuana in privately owned apartment buildings.

“It eased my mind because I realized that they’re aware” of the problems in the area, Odessa Watson, 39, said of the officers.

Officer Patrick Malone, 32, who helped to lead the meeting, said he gave out the number for his city-issued cellphone and received calls from residents at all hours. “It’s good information,” he said.

His sergeant, Shaun Brown, said that while some people wanted to see more officers on foot, “we’re in the car 100 percent of the time.” Despite adding 1,300 officers to the Police Department, for counterterrorism and to facilitate the new neighborhood-based program, they would need far more to cover their area on foot, he said.

Few people under 40-years-old were at the meetings. At several, including one in the Bronx on Thursday, officers implored those who came to bring their younger relatives. Assistant Chief Rodney Harrison said that the department was looking to help neighborhood-based officers reach problematic young people by going “to them” in schools and community centers. They would entice the young people to show up, he said, by offering “some type of gift,” like a sporting goods gift card or movie tickets.

“It’s a fluid philosophy,” said Chief Monahan. “This is all about trusting our cops.” He added that the department did not want officers to make arrests for the sake it.

Pragmatism on Patrols

That message has reached the street.

As Detective Rodriguez walked through a desolate corner of his Upper Manhattan sector this month, near an otherwise empty skateboard park, he and his partner, Detective Thomas W. Troppmann, came upon three men huddled under a footbridge. One had his shirt sleeve rolled up. Another appeared to be cooking heroin.

As the officers approached, the men quickly skirted away, leaving belongings behind.

In another era, the encounter might have ended with an arrest, or at least a formal police stop. But Detectives Rodriguez and Troppmann did not see a case to be made, or much point in locking up clearly drug-addicted men who later admitted they were struggling with heroin addiction.

“Hey, come get your jacket!” Detective Rodriguez called out to the men.

Two turned back, and the officers spoke to them about addiction services. The third, whom the officers suspected of being a dealer, kept walking.",De Blasio Kept Crime Down in First Term.

Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

The Princeton research is being released amid renewed debate about slavery, the Civil War and national memory. It also arrives nearly two years after a student group at Princeton called the Black Justice League occupied the president’s office and demanded, among other things, that Woodrow Wilson’s name be removed from places of honor on campus because of his racist ideas and actions.

Wilson, a Princeton graduate and former president of the university, kept his place, and that controversy quieted down. The new research does not come with any recommendations for action. But Professor Sandweiss said she hoped it would foster a broader, more fully informed conversation about history and racial justice.

“Woodrow Wilson doesn’t just come from nowhere, “ she said. “He comes from this particular place.”

Unlike slavery research at some other institutions, the Princeton project was a bottom-up affair, originating with an undergraduate class that Professor Sandweiss began teaching in 2013, with help from the university’s archivist, Dan Linke. Early on, she told the administration what she was doing and said she didn’t think it would be “embarrassing to Princeton,” she recalled.

As the project grew, it was supported piecemeal by various partners, including the university’s art museum, which has commissioned a large-scale outdoor installation by the artist Titus Kaphar commemorating the 1766 slave sale, and the McCarter Theater, which has commissioned seven plays inspired by the research, to be performed later this month as part of a two-day public symposium.

Earlier this year, the project got more formal support from the administration, in the form of a grant from the Princeton Histories Fund, established in the wake of the Wilson controversy to support “aspects of Princeton’s history that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated or suppressed.”

Princeton’s current president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, who will speak at the symposium, issued a statement praising the project’s “creativity, diverse perspectives and rigorous academic standards,” which he said he hoped would promote “a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of our history.”

That history is certainly imposing. Princeton, founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, is the nation’s fourth-oldest university, and the one most associated with the American Revolution. Its sixth president, John Witherspoon, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1783, the Continental Congress briefly met in Nassau Hall, in the same room where campus lore holds that a cannonball (fired by Alexander Hamilton, no less) decapitated a portrait of George III six years earlier.

Today, that room is lined with oil portraits of the university’s presidents, the first nine of whom owned slaves. (The researchers found no evidence that the university itself ever owned slaves.) On a recent morning, Professor Sandweiss paused in front of the likeness of Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751-1819).

Smith, a Presbyterian minister, helped inspire the colonization movement, which advocated resettling freed slaves in Africa. (Many leading colonization advocates, the researchers discovered, had Princeton connections.)

But at a time when many educated whites believed that blacks had separate evolutionary origins, Smith also argued that racial differences were purely due to environment, and even advocated interracial marriage.

“Historians are fond of going around saying, ‘It’s complicated,’” Professor Sandweiss said. “But it is complicated.”

Professor Sandweiss’s team, which included some 30 students and two full-time postdoctoral fellows, Craig Hollander and Joseph Yannielli, looked at subjects familiar from studies at other universities, like slavery-related donations and slave ownership among professors, including one who owned a slave as late as 1840.

But they also zeroed in on one of the distinctive, and fateful, aspects of Princeton’s history: its heavily Southern student body.

In the archives, they found evidence of early administrators’ eagerness to recruit students from the South. To nail down some hard data, a dozen graduate students gathered in the archives one night and, with the cast album of “Hamilton” blaring, tracked down the places of origin for more than 2,000 names in their database of pre-Civil War students.

Roughly 40 percent of students from the college’s founding until 1861, the researchers determined, came from the slaveholding South, with the figure spiking at two-thirds in the early 1850s. (The figure for Harvard and Yale at that time was about 9 percent.) And as slavery moved southwest, a heat map on the website shows, so too did the student body.

“Princeton had more students from Mississippi in the decades before the Civil War than it does today,” Professor Sandweiss said.

This fact heavily influenced the culture at Princeton, which became more conservative as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.

In town, Southern students (as well as many Northern ones) encountered something unfamiliar: a proud, and longstanding, free black community. But inside the campus gates, the university was maintained as a safe space for the sons of slaveholders.

Unlike at Harvard and Yale, abolitionists were generally not invited to speak on campus. And when they did show up, violence sometimes ensued. In 1835, a gang of students descended on the town’s African-American neighborhood in an attempt to lynch a white agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society who had come to address a secret meeting. (Researchers found no records of any attempts to discipline those students.)

The next year, at commencement, a white student from South Carolina attacked a black abolitionist minister, Theodore Sedgwick Wright, shouting a racial slur. The university’s president, James Carnahan, a onetime slaveholder, published a letter denying that the attacker was a Princeton student or that any actual violence had occurred, and blaming Wright for the disturbance.

But Princeton’s compromise over slavery, like the nation’s, didn’t hold forever. In the university’s archives, R. Isabela Morales, a graduate student, found an 1846 diary in which a student from Mississippi described going out with other “Southern bloods” to hunt down a local black man they had scuffled with and “try him in the worshipful court of Judge Lynch.”

Another group of students, led by John Maclean Jr., a professor who later became Princeton’s first nonslaveholding president, mustered to try and stop them. The man was still “whipped within an inch of his life,” the diarist exulted, “to the silent Satisfaction of all the arrayed collegians from the South!”

“Princeton had a reputation as this moderate place, where Northerners and Southerners got along,” Ms. Morales said. “But here, 15 years before the Civil War, you have them dividing along battle lines to fight over the question of race.”

Photo

As Southern states began seceding, southern students began leaving campus. In student autograph books, Ms. Sandweiss’s team found poignant inscriptions traded by friends who would soon meet on the battlefield. “Basically, they’re going off to kill their roommates,” Professor Sandweiss said.

The researchers have yet to figure out just when southern students (like the Virginia-born Wilson, class of 1879), started coming back after the Civil War, and in what numbers. But the instinct to keep the sectional peace reasserted itself.

An article on the website tells the story of the Civil War memorial carved on a wall just inside Nassau Hall in the 1920s — the only one anywhere in the country, Professor Sandweiss said, to give no indication of which cause the names inscribed there fought for.

The initial plan was to group them by side. But the university’s president at the time, John Grier Hibben, overruled it, saying “no one shall know on which side these young men fought.”

Photo

On today’s campuses, the battles are often fought over monuments themselves. One of the new plays commissioned for the project, by Nathan Alan Davis, features a rawly funny dialogue between a statue of John Witherspoon, Princeton’s slave-owning Revolutionary War-era president, and a contemporary African-American student armed with a blowtorch.

As part of the aftermath of the Wilson controversy, Princeton is already discussing ways to make its iconography more reflective of its current diversity.

“If you walk around campus, you see a lot of dead white men,” Professor Sandweiss said. “That’s not untrue to our history, but it is deeply untrue to what Princeton has worked hard to become in the past few decades.”

Qualcomm is likely to quickly reject the bid, believing that it dramatically undervalues the company. It is trying to close its own big acquisition, the $38.5 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductor, a chip maker whose products are becoming important in the internet-of-things ecosystem. (A condition of Broadcom’s offer is that Qualcomm not raise its offer to NXP beyond its current level of $110 a share.)

In a statement on Monday, Qualcomm said only that it was reviewing the Broadcom proposal.

Shares in Qualcomm traded below Broadcom’s offer as of Monday morning, at $63.83, potentially reflecting skepticism from shareholders that the takeover bid will succeed. Shares in Broadcom were little changed.

Though Mr. Tan famously avoids the news media, he took a big step into prominence on Thursday when he appeared with President Trump at the White House to announce that Broadcom would move its legal base to the United States from Singapore. Some analysts have questioned whether that decision was meant to help win political support for a takeover of Qualcomm, which is expected to face tough antitrust scrutiny.

For Qualcomm and its advisers, the biggest issue is likely to be a simple matter of price. Though the company last traded above $70 a share two years ago, its management team believes that the chip maker is poised for a rebound, thanks in part to the NXP acquisition and to a belief that it can prevail in its fight with Apple.

More fundamentally, the company believes that its trove of patents — among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking — remains a hugely valuable asset. And it is betting that it will be able to help define the forthcoming 5G standard for superfast networking.

But investors were unnerved by a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, that Apple was weighing excluding Qualcomm’s chips from next year’s batch of iPhones, relying instead on competing products from the likes of Intel.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGREGOR / I’LL ASK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

The initial plan was to group them by side. But the university’s president at the time, John Grier Hibben, overruled it, saying “no one shall know on which side these young men fought.”

On today’s campuses, the battles are often fought over monuments themselves. One of the new plays commissioned for the project, by Nathan Alan Davis, features a rawly funny dialogue between a statue of John Witherspoon, Princeton’s slave-owning Revolutionary War-era president, and a contemporary African-American student armed with a blowtorch.

As part of the aftermath of the Wilson controversy, Princeton is already discussing ways to make its iconography more reflective of its current diversity.

“If you walk around campus, you see a lot of dead white men,” Professor Sandweiss said. “That’s not untrue to our history, but it is deeply untrue to what Princeton has worked hard to become in the past few decades.”

Not only have Buddhist thinkers for millenniums been making very much the kinds of claims that Western philosophers and psychologists make — many of these claims are looking good in light of modern Western thought. In fact, in some cases Buddhist thought anticipated Western thought, grasping things about the human mind, and its habitual misperception of reality, that modern psychology is only now coming to appreciate.

Consider a quote that Gopnik employs in suggesting that appraising Buddhist philosophy may be a fool’s errand. It is from a Zen Buddhist who, in analyzing a famous text called the Heart Sutra, wrote this: “Things exist but they are not real.” I agree with Gopnik that this sentence seems a bit hard to unpack. But if you go look at the book it is taken from, you’ll find that the author himself, Mu Soeng, does a good job of unpacking it.

It turns out Soeng is explaining an idea that is central to Buddhist philosophy: “not self” — the idea that your “self,” as you intuitively conceive it, is actually an illusion. Soeng writes that the doctrine of not-self doesn’t deny an “existential personality” — it doesn’t deny that there is a you that exists; what it denies is that somewhere within you is an “abiding core,” a kind of essence-of-you that remains constant amid the flux of thoughts, feelings, perceptions and other elements that constitute your experience. So if by “you” we mean a “self” that features an enduring essence, then you aren’t real.

Now, you can argue with this line of thought — with its characterization of the self, its definition of “real” and “exist,” and so on. But the point is that this line of thought is clear enough to argue about — just like the lines of thought Western philosophers produce. In fact, David Hume, an emphatically Western philosopher, made an argument against the reality of the self that is so similar to longstanding Buddhist arguments as to make some scholars (including, as it happens, Alison Gopnik, Adam’s sister) suspect that Hume had encountered Buddhist thought.

In recent decades, important aspects of the Buddhist concept of not-self have gotten support from psychology. In particular, psychology has bolstered Buddhism’s doubts about our intuition of what you might call the “C.E.O. self” — our sense that the conscious “self” is the initiator of thought and action.

A particularly famous experiment seems to show that, before we are consciously aware of deciding to perform an act — push a button, say — the physical processes that initiate the act are already underway. Other experiments suggest that our minds are good at fabricating reasons that we do certain things and hold certain opinions — and that the fabrication happens unconsciously, so that the conscious mind is itself duped into believing these stories, along with their implication that the conscious mind is running the show.

If much of this sounds disappointingly free of the charming paradox commonly associated with Buddhism, I have good news: There is a paradox that can surface if you pursue the logic of not-self through meditation. Namely: recognizing that “you” are not in control, that you are not a C.E.O., can help give “you” more control. Or, at least, you can behave more like a C.E.O. is expected to behave: more rationally, more wisely, more reflectively; less emotionally, less rashly, less reactively.

Here’s how it can work. Suppose that, via mindfulness meditation, you observe a feeling like anxiety or anger and, rather than let it draw you into a whole train of anxious or angry thoughts, you let it pass away. Though you experience the feeling — and in a sense experience it more fully than usual — you experience it with “non-attachment” and so evade its grip. And you now see the thoughts that accompanied it in a new light — they no longer seem like trustworthy emanations from some “I” but rather as transient notions accompanying transient feelings.

Note how, in addition to being therapeutic, this clarifies your view of the world. After all, the “anxious” or “angry” trains of thought you avoid probably aren’t objectively true. They probably involve either imagining things that haven’t happened or making subjective judgments about things that have. In other words, these thoughts are just stories the brain spews out; they are often manifestly misleading, and abandoning them will tend to leave us closer to clarity than embracing them would.

Mindfulness meditation can be enlightening in another way, too. It can make us more aware of how our buttons get pushed — more aware, say, of how people or things we encounter trigger certain feelings and certain stories and thus certain behaviors. Somewhat like “Western” psychological science, mindfulness can illuminate the workings of the mind.

There’s a broader and deeper sense in which Buddhist thought is more “Western” than stereotype suggests. What, after all, is more Western than science’s emphasis on causality, on figuring out what causes what, and hoping to thus explain why all things do the things they do? Well, in a sense, the Buddhist idea of “not-self” grows out of the belief undergirding this mission — that the world is pervasively governed by causal laws. The reason there is no “abiding core” within us is that the ever-changing forces that impinge on us — the sights, the sounds, the smells, the tastes — are constantly setting off chain reactions inside of us.

Indeed, this constant causal interaction with our environment raises doubts not only about how firm the core of the “self” is but, in a sense, how firm the bounds of the self are. Buddhism’s doubts about the distinctness and solidity of the “self” — and of other things, for that matter — rests on a recognition of the sense in which pervasive causality means pervasive fluidity.

The kind of inquiry that produced Buddhist views on the human psyche isn’t scientific; it doesn’t involve experiments that generate publicly observable data. It rests more on a kind of meditative introspection — somewhat in the spirit of what Western philosophers call phenomenology. Yet Buddhism long ago generated insights that modern psychology is only now catching up to, and these go beyond doubts about the C.E.O. self.

For example, psychology has lately started to let go of its once-sharp distinction between “cognitive” and “affective” parts of the mind; it has started to see that feelings are so finely intertwined with thoughts as to be part of their very coloration. This wouldn’t qualify as breaking news in Buddhist circles. A sutra attributed to the Buddha says that a “mind object” — a category that includes thoughts — is just like a taste or a smell: whether a person is “tasting a flavor with the tongue” or “smelling an odor with the nose” or “cognizing a mind object with the mind,” the person “lusts after it if it is pleasing” and “dislikes it if it is unpleasing.”

Brain-scan studies have produced tentative evidence that this lusting and disliking — embracing thoughts that feel good and rejecting thoughts that feel bad — lies near the heart of certain “cognitive biases.” If such evidence continues to accumulate, the Buddhist assertion that a clear view of the world involves letting go of these lusts and dislikes will have drawn a measure of support from modern science.

Gopnik thinks that attempts to corroborate Buddhist ideas with modern science run into a contradiction. After all, Buddhism is in a sense suspicious of “stories” — such as those stories that mindfulness meditation can help liberate us from. And, Gopnik says, science is just “competitive storytelling” — which means, he says, that Buddhism is “antithetical” to scientific argument. He writes, “Science is putting names on things and telling stories about them, the very habits that Buddhists urge us to transcend.” Well, this irony doesn’t seem to have deterred the Buddhists who, a couple of millenniums ago, compiled the “Abhidhamma Pitaka,” which puts names on lots of mental phenomena and tells stories about how they relate to one another. And it doesn’t seem to bother the Dalai Lama, who has embraced science as a legitimate way to test Buddhist ideas.

I agree with Gopnik on one thing: There are parts of Buddhist philosophy that, even when properly understood, seem paradoxical or opaque. But these tend to involve the same issues that drive Western philosophers toward paradox and opaqueness — for example, the relationship of consciousness to the physical body. Language is indeed (as notable Western philosophers have held) incapable of encompassing all of reality, and I’m pretty sure that the human mind is incapable of comprehending all of reality.

All we can do is clear away as many impediments to comprehension as possible. Science has a way of doing that — by insisting that entrants in its “competitive storytelling” demonstrate explanatory power in ways that are publicly observable, thus neutralizing, to the extent possible, subjective biases that might otherwise prevail. Buddhism has a different way of doing it: via meditative disciplines that are designed to attack subjective biases at the source, yielding a clearer view of both the mind itself and the world beyond it.

The results of these two inquiries converge to a remarkable extent — an extent that can be appreciated only in light of the last few decades of progress in psychology and evolutionary science. At least, that’s my argument. It may be wrong. But it’s an argument that can be engaged by anyone willing to engage it — which is something it has in common with Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist psychology.",Buddhism Is More ‘Western’ Than You Think,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/buddhism-western-philosophy.html

Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil’s operations there. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.

Mr. Ross emerges as a particularly valued client for the offshore law firm, whose records provide more insight into his financial holdings beyond the public ethics disclosures he made upon joining the Trump administration. His ethics agreement filed in January listed the partnerships he intended to keep, but not the investments they held. Previously, Navigator had been mentioned in a separate, 57-page description of his holdings for the year that ended in December 2016, but with no hint of its ties to Sibur.

Sibur’s top ownership — including Gennady Timchenko, who is Mr. Putin’s friend and judo partner and is subject to American sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, who is married to the Russian president’s youngest daughter — makes it “a company with crony connections” in Moscow, said Daniel Fried, a Russia expert who served in senior State Department posts in Republican and Democratic administrations.

Another of Navigator’s major customers is PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company, controlled by the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on PDVSA this summer.

In a written response to questions by the Times, James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, said that Navigator’s relationship with Sibur began before Mr. Ross joined the board in March 2012, and that he had never met the Russian oligarchs who are Sibur’s major shareholders. Public records show that Mr. Ross’s firm became a major investor in Navigator in November 2011, three months before the company chartered its first ships to Sibur.

“Sibur was not under sanctions at the time the contract was signed and is still not subject to sanctions,” Mr. Rockas said.

More broadly, he said that Mr. Ross “recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration’s sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities.”

“Secretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption,” Mr. Rockas said, “and he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards.”

It is perhaps unsurprising that Navigator would have a relationship with a major Russian company during Mr. Ross’s tenure. Much like President Trump, whose company sought approval for a hotel project in Moscow as recently as last year, Mr. Ross has long shown an appreciation for the untapped potential of Russian markets when seeking investment opportunities. His involvement there dates at least to the 1990s, when he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund, established to promote American business interests in Russia.

In addition to Navigator, his firm also acquired a German rail car company, VTG, which pursued an expansion strategy in Russia before Mr. Ross sold his stake in 2016. And Mr. Ross led a private bailout of the Bank of Cyprus, long regarded as a favorite financial haven of wealthy Russians, after the worldwide economic crisis crippled the Cypriot banking system.

In the wake of reports of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, multiple investigations have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of the Trump administration. While several Trump campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior administration officials and members of Mr. Putin’s family or inner circle.

During Mr. Ross’s confirmation process, he was asked repeatedly about his business ties to Russia, mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he dealt with Russian investors but also forced some of them out of the bank. He was also asked about his investment in another shipping company, Diamond S, and whether its dealings with China could pose a conflict with his government duties. But he faced no questions about Navigator and its significant financial relationship with Sibur.

Mr. Rockas did not respond to questions about the current status of Mr. Ross’s investment. If Mr. Ross stands to benefit, albeit indirectly, from a Russian firm controlled by members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, it poses a potential conflict with his role as the lead cabinet member on trade policy, ethics experts said. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and has emerged as a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said that while Mr. Ross’s continued investment in Navigator would not violate any laws, it created other ethical concerns.

“Apart from those legal issues,” Mr. Painter said, “I’d be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians.”

As for Navigator, its leadership sees blue skies ahead with one of its key investors now at the helm of American trade policy.

On Nov. 30 of last year, hours after being nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross celebrated at Gramercy Tavern, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, at an event hosted by Navigator. He and David J. Butters, Navigator’s chief executive, arrived early to a private room and had a chat.

“Your interest is aligned to mine,” Mr. Butters recalls Mr. Ross saying, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. “The U.S. economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.”

Looking East

Mr. Ross’s foray into transoceanic shipping took off in 2011, when his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., assembled teams of investors to acquire major stakes in Diamond S Shipping and Navigator Holdings. Both firms specialized in chartering tankers to petroleum companies that need to move gas, oil and petrochemicals around the world. With Mr. Ross’s involvement, they would expand their business interests in China and Russia.

The investments — eventually totaling more than $600 million in Diamond S and about $240 million in Navigator — were in keeping with Mr. Ross’s strategy of scooping up shares in undervalued companies and turning them around. It is a business model that has earned Mr. Ross, a 79-year-old Ivy League-educated son of middle-class parents from New Jersey, the sobriquet of “king of bankruptcy.”

Over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the British banking firm Rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at Rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering Trump casinos in Atlantic City, preserving a stake for Mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the Trump name was “still very much an asset.”

Mr. Ross’s business practices have occasionally drawn criticism for moving American jobs overseas in an effort to improve profits. A Reuters analysis of Labor Department statistics found that his takeovers shifted 2,700 jobs in automotive, textiles and mortgage finance to, among other places, China, India, Mexico and Nicaragua.

In the statement to The Times, Mr. Ross’s spokesman said, “Private equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and Secretary Ross has decades of experience that he is now using to benefit American workers.”

As worldwide shipping concerns, Diamond S and Navigator did not have much of a labor footprint in the United States when Mr. Ross and his investors took over. But the way both companies did business would pose potential conflicts with American interests in other ways.

Alongside Mr. Ross, another large investor in Diamond S was a company controlled by the Chinese government, according to securities filings. And Navigator signed a charter agreement with Sibur shortly after Mr. Ross’s firm made its investment. Sibur said in a statement that any negotiations with Navigator over the years were carried out by its executives, not its major shareholders, and that “no meetings were held with Mr. Ross.”

Initially, Navigator chartered two vessels to Sibur, and later increased the fleet to four. The relationship proved to be so profitable that Navigator’s chief executive, Mr. Butters, told investors in a 2016 conference call how Navigator benefited as Sibur beat out American competitors in the growing European energy market.

“Russia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into Europe, and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts, all in competition with longer-haul U.S. exports,” Mr. Butters said.

Putin Connections

As one of the largest gas companies in Russia, Sibur is not just any private business.

It was created by the Russian government and maintains a close dependency on Moscow, even after its sale in 2010 to Mr. Timchenko and Leonid Mikhelson. The two men are typical of Russian moguls who have benefited from state-owned assets and are expected to remain loyal to the Putin government, said Amos J. Hochstein, a top energy diplomat under the Obama administration.

“When you start doing business with Russian energy companies like Gazprom and Sibur, you’re not just getting into bed with the company,” Mr. Hochstein said. “You’re getting into bed with the Russian state.”

The ties to the Russian president, however, proved to be a double-edged sword for Sibur’s owners. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, American and Western allies imposed economic sanctions on key Putin associates, including Mr. Timchenko. A few months later, the United States barred banks from providing new financing to another gas company, Novatek, belonging to Mr. Mikhelson.

Sibur itself was not targeted. But financial institutions, including Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland, backed away from loans to the company, according to news reports at the time. Moscow stepped in to help in May 2014, when a government-backed financial consortium bought a shipping terminal from Sibur and pledged to expand export capacity, while allowing Sibur to remain the terminal’s sole exporter of gas.

Then, in September 2014, as sanctions pressure was growing, Mr. Timchenko reduced his holdings in Sibur by selling a 17 percent stake to a junior shareholder, Mr. Shamalov. A year earlier, Mr. Shamalov, whose father is a friend and former business partner of Mr. Putin’s, had married the Russian president’s daughter Katerina. His Sibur purchase, which pushed the 32-year-old Mr. Shamalov’s investment to more than 20 percent of the company, was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from the state-backed Gazprombank. Mr. Shamalov sold part of his stake in April, reducing it to 3.9 percent.

Most of these financial machinations were carried out through offshore companies on Cyprus, where Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko held their investments in Sibur and did business with several Cypriot banks. During the summer of 2014, Mr. Ross had become the Bank of Cyprus’s vice chairman, though there is no indication that he crossed paths with the two oligarchs during his tenure there.

His position at the bank required him to step down from the board of Navigator, however, even as he retained his investment in the company. His close associate at WL Ross & Co., Wendy L. Teramoto, took his place at Navigator and, later, left to join Mr. Ross as chief of staff at the Commerce Department.

Despite the reluctance of Western financial institutions to do business with Sibur and its owners, Navigator’s relationship with Sibur continued to grow.

From 2014 to 2015, the portion of Navigator’s total revenue that came from Sibur jumped to 9.1 percent from 5.3 percent, making the company one of its top five clients, according to securities filings, before dipping to 7.9 percent last year.

Ethics Disclosures

As WL Ross & Co. expanded over the years, it used Appleby, the offshore specialist, to set up an increasing number of entities in tax havens, many in the Cayman Islands. This British territory in the Caribbean levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction, and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. By 2014, Mr. Ross and his investment company were among Appleby’s top 20 clients.

After he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross filed an agreement with the federal Office of Government Ethics saying he would resign from WL Ross & Co. and divest from 80 companies and partnerships, but would keep a stake in nine others that held assets in “real estate financing and mortgage lending” and “transoceanic shipping.” The underlying assets were not specified.

Photo

His financial disclosure form offered more detail, including a list of assets that had been held by each of the partnerships that he retained. Navigator Holdings appeared in connection with four Appleby-managed Cayman partnerships. Mr. Ross’s ethics filing valued his stake in those partnerships at between $2.05 million and $10.1 million, a fraction of the partnerships’ combined 31.5 percent stake in Navigator, which, based on the firm’s recent stock price, was worth roughly $179 million. In all, WL Ross & Co. remains Navigator’s largest shareholder, according to the shipping company’s most recent annual report.

Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have “a direct and predictable” effect on their financial interests or cause a reasonable doubt about their impartiality. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his continued business holdings and his cabinet post.

“I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt,” he said.",Commerce Secretary’s Offshore Ties to Putin ‘Cronies’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/wilbur-ross-russia.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

They also found special tactics for hiding: Armillaria can reabsorb substances lost in the soil that alert trees of their presence and avoid the tree’s full defenses. This lets them kill trees undetected and start leeching nutrients from the dead stuff before competing bacteria and fungi arrived. And if and when competitors do show up, Armillaria can create a chemical environment intolerable for them.

However they find their hosts, pathogenic Armillaria are ancient. They arrived an estimated 21 million years ago and stuck around for a reason.

In healthy, natural, diverse forests, the fungi absorb carbon and kill only the weakest trees, like gangly, underground forest rangers. But in monocultures made up of genetically identical trees, stresses like drought can cause all the trees to fall weak simultaneously.

“This is how Armillaria can wipe out entire forests,” said György Sipos, a biologist at the University of Sopron in Hungary who led the study with László Nagy, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships at Instagram, was a beauty editor there. Emily Weiss, the Into the Gloss founder and Glossier C.E.O., was an intern. In 2006, the magazine became a backdrop for the popular MTV series “The Hills.”

Ms. Wintour appointed Amy Astley, who had been the beauty editor of Vogue, to oversee Teen Vogue. Its small (6¾” x 9”!) pages featured the high-budget fashion editorials that are its parent magazine’s signature, for the low starting price of $1.50 per issue (“about as much as a ChapStick,” the late media critic David Carr wrote). Its accompanying website became a meeting place for young people.

Arabelle Sicardi, also a writer, said that before she read Teen Vogue’s web forums, she saw fashion and beauty as alien subjects.

“I had never thought that fashion ever applied to me, really, so having people my age to talk to and share our interpretations of it was something that I really cherished,” she said. “She went on to become a blogger and was featured in Teen Vogue for her work. Later, the magazine hired her as an intern and regular contributor.

“Teen Vogue is my family,” Ms. Sicardi said. “I grew up in those hallways. I was probably at the magazine for longer than I was ever in a classroom.”

Elaine Welteroth, the print magazine’s second and final leader, had been a mentor to Ms. Sicardi. Ms. Welteroth took over from Ms. Astley in 2016 and was officially named editor in chief this spring, in a grim climate for magazines aimed at the older-teen set (R.I.P. CosmoGirl, YM, Teen People, Elle Girl).

The youngest-ever editor in chief at Condé Nast — she is 30 — Ms. Welterorth quickly became an Instagram celebrity and received heaping praise for the magazine’s newly “woke” tone. Teen Vogue 2.0, as she reimagined it, wasn’t just about clothes and makeup; it was about news, politics and social justice, too.

In her first year, Ms. Astley had emphasized how crucial it was for her to create a product that was “racially, ethnically diverse, fashion-wise diverse. We don’t say someone is or isn’t Teen Vogue.” The magazine entered the field at a time when millennials were just beginning to document their lives online, with LiveJournal and MySpace, and the platforms that continue to replace print publications showcase diversity even more effectively.

It wasn’t until 2015, after a decade of mostly white, mostly famous cover stars, that Teen Vogue changed course, with a cover featuring three little-known black models. The issue became the year’s best seller, underscoring the appetite for fashion magazines that reflect some version of real life.

“I’ve always been a queer, gender-nonconforming kid and person,” said Kate Lesniak, the publisher of Bitch Media. “I never really cared about those magazines because I never saw myself in them at all, in any way.”

But recently, Ms. Lesniak noticed a shift in the tone and presentation of Teen Vogue.

“In the last year and a half or two years,” she said, it had become “a mainstream media outlet in print that reflected people like me back to ourselves. Teen Vogue did an incredible job of amplifying communities of color and queer people as well.”

That representation has come in the form of articles that criticize racial insensitivity, trumpet black feminism and explain how to be a transgender ally, as well as a guide to anal sex that received mixed reviews, mostly from adults. Ms. Welteroth also courted activist-actresses like Rowan Blanchard, Hari Nef and Yara Shahidi, who now serve as unofficial brand ambassadors to their combined millions of followers.

Readers and admirers lamented the end of Teen Vogue’s print run after the announcement.

Teen Vogue will continue to publish articles online, leaving Seventeen and J-14 as the only mainstream print lifestyle magazines for that age demographic.

“All the teen magazines that existed 10, 15 years ago that don’t exist now, they’re the reason I became a writer,” Ms. Fitzpatrick said.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani newlywed has been arrested and charged with murder in the poisoning of 17 people, including several of her in-laws, in what officials described as an attempt to escape from a forced marriage.

The woman, Aasia Bibi, 21, and a man identified as her boyfriend were accused of having intentionally put rat poison into milk that was served to family members at a gathering.

Ms. Bibi, who appeared in a court in Punjab Province, told reporters she had begged her parents not to force her to marry, but her pleas were ignored. She has been charged under the country’s antiterrorism law and was placed in pretrial detention.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.","Some of that is simply politics. But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

A Lesson to Learn?

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

With Elliott and Prescott in action, Cowboys roll.

The Dallas Cowboys showed just how good the team can be with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott at full-strength, as the duo led the team to a hard-fought 28-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. Now they have to wait and see if their partnership will be broken up for the next several weeks.

Elliott was on the field thanks to an appeals court briefly delaying his six-game suspension with an administrative stay, but it is expected that his fate for the next six games will be decided this week. The second-year running back took advantage of the unexpected start by rushing for 93 yards and a touchdown, helping complement a fine performance by Prescott, who threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns while running for another score, in the come-from-behind win.

Prescott’s success came thanks to a pair of passing touchdowns to Cole Beasley, and a 141-yard day by Terrance Williams, as the team survived Dez Bryant leaving the game in the second half with an ankle injury.

It looked for much of the first half like it would be a boring matchup between teams trying too hard to be careful, but things picked up dramatically in the last two minutes before halftime. Both teams scored in the final 13 seconds of the half, with Tyreek Hill of the Chiefs scoring an unbelievable 57-yard catch-and-run touchdown as time expired. Hill had at least five defenders between him and the end zone when he caught the ball, but he used his patience and game-changing speed to weave through the crowd, nearly untouched, for the score.

Kansas City then opened the second half with another touchdown drive, which briefly gave them a 17-14 lead. From that point on, though, the game was all Dallas, as both the offense and defense found a higher gear. Their much-maligned secondary even managed to end Alex Smith’s season-long streak of passes without an interception when Jeff Heath stepped in front of a pass intended for Charcandrick West in the fourth quarter.

Going forward, things could be truly complicated for Dallas. Elliott could be out for up to six weeks, the severity of Bryant’s injury is not known, and the Cowboys may be facing an extended stretch in which Prescott will be trying to keep the team’s playoff hopes alive with his primary offensive support coming from players like Darren McFadden, Alfred Morris and Beasley.

With or without Elliott, Dallas will travel to Atlanta to face the struggling Falcons next week and then will host the red-hot Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11.

Redskins shock Seahawks with late drive.

Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson appeared to have secured his second consecutive comeback win with a dramatic touchdown pass in the game’s final minutes. Not to be outdone, Kirk Cousins put together one of the most impressive drives of his career, going 70 yards on just four plays to secure a 17-14 victory.

Cousins did not throw a touchdown pass in the game, but his bold passes into Seattle’s secondary in the game’s final minutes were key to the shocking victory. The second long pass, a 38-yarder to Josh Doctson, set up Rob Kelley for a game-winning 1-yard touchdown run.

Kelley’s two touchdowns accounted for most of the scoring for Washington, and the team survived the late surge by Wilson, who threw for 297 yards and rushed for 77.

The Falcons’ Super Bowl hangover isn’t going away.

The Atlanta Falcons continue to struggle to hold onto leads. In what has become a dramatic Super Bowl hangover, the Falcons’ record dropped to 4-4 after a 20-17 loss to the Carolina Panthers in which they had a 10-0 lead until late in the second quarter.

The Panthers worked their way back into the game with the team’s running game, and eventually rushed for a combined 201 yards on 38 carries, with Cam Newton leading the team with 86 yards, while he and Christian McCaffrey each scored on a rushing touchdown.

Atlanta continued to fight even after falling behind 20-10. They got the ball back one last time with just over two minutes remaining and a deficit of three points, but the offense mustered minus-three yards while turning the ball over on downs when Matt Ryan’s fourth down pass failed to connect with Taylor Gabriel. But the day was symbolized by a play earlier in the fourth quarter where Ryan threw what appeared to be a perfect 39-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones that the sure-handed receiver simply dropped, resulting in a turnover on downs.

It was the type of mistake Atlanta never made during the team’s run to the Super Bowl last season.

The already-good Eagles just got a lot better.

The Philadelphia Eagles already had the N.F.L.’s best record, a quarterback leading the league in touchdown passes and a defense that makes life miserable for opponents each and every week. The addition of Jay Ajayi to the running game made them seem like something out of a video game in a 51-23 demolishing of the Denver Broncos.

There were no weaknesses on display for the Eagles. Carson Wentz, who came into the game tied for the N.F.L. lead with 19 touchdown passes, threw four more, while completing 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards before being taken out in the fourth quarter with the score well out of hand.

Wentz now has sole possession of the passing touchdown lead with 23, but he was focused on other things.

”Touchdowns are great, but being 8-1 is what it’s all about,” he told reporters after the game.

Wentz had plenty of help, as the team’s running game, powered by LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and the newly-acquired Ajayi combined to carry the ball 37 times for 197 yards and three touchdowns. Coming into the game, Philadelphia had just four rushing touchdowns all season.

That the Eagles had so much success running the ball against the second-rated rushing defense in the N.F.L. was a testament to Ajayi. The pro bowl running back was traded from the Dolphins this week and went from an underperforming malcontent in Miami to energizing Philadelphia with a 46-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter. He finished with a team-leading 77 yards.

The Broncos, meanwhile, tried to shake things up by switching from Trevor Siemian to Brock Osweiler at quarterback, but any improvement was hard to see in a game in which Osweiler completed just 19 of 38 passes for 208 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He was repeatedly harassed by Philadelphia’s front-seven and made several mistakes, including the two turnovers, both of which led to Eagles touchdowns.

The highlights were few and far between for Denver, but they included Osweiler hitting Demaryius Thomas for a 1-yard touchdown pass, Brandon McManus connecting on two field goals from 50-plus yards, and Brandon Marshall, Denver’s standout linebacker, getting his first career fumble recovery for a touchdown after a strip-sack of Nick Foles by Von Miller.

Saints win sixth-straight game; Winston hurt.

The Saints extended their winning streak to six when Drew Brees completed 81.2 percent of his passes for 263 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-10 victory over reeling Tampa Bay.

The Buccaneers came in hoping to stem a four-game skid, but instead were not just beaten, but beaten up. Quarterback Jameis Winston left with shoulder soreness after the first half. Starting defensive end William Gholston was carted off the field with a neck injury. And tensions boiled over when Winston, after he had left the game, appeared to instigate a scuffle along the sideline.

Brees’ touchdowns went for 33 yards to Alvin Kamara and 36 yards to Ted Ginn. Kamara, who also scored on a 6-yard run, did most of the work on his TD reception, thrilling the Superdome crowd with a waving, tackle-slipping run after his short catch.

The Saints also scored on Justin Hardee’s blocked punt, which Hardee recovered in stride and returned for a touchdown.

Kamara finished with 172 yards from scrimmage, including six catches for 84 yards. — Associated Press

With A.J. Green and Jalen Ramsey ejected for fighting, Jaydon Mickens delivered the knockout blow by returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown, helping the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-7.

The Jaguars (5-3) won consecutive games for the first time in 13 months and were victorious at EverBank Field for the first time since last December.

Blake Bortles threw for 259 yards and a touchdown in another efficient performance. Marqise Lee had his first TD reception of the season and responded by punting the ball into the stands. And Jacksonville’s defense handled Cincinnati’s woeful offense for most of the afternoon.

But most of the talk will center on Green and Ramsey.

The perennial Pro Bowl receiver retaliated against the trash-talking cornerback in a violent way late in the first half. After Ramsey knocked Green to the ground at the end of a running play, Green grabbed Ramsey around the neck and slammed him to the ground. Green then delivered numerous punches to Ramsey’s helmet — never the smartest idea — and put another M.M.A.-style choke hold on Ramsey. It was the kind of aggressive attack that could lead to a suspension.

Players from both sidelines rushed the field, pushing, pulling, shoving, screaming and looking like they would brawl.

Jaguars rookie running back Leonard Fournette was inactive for violating a team rule. Jacksonville made the surprise announcement 90 minutes before kickoff. It’s unclear what Fournette did to draw coach Doug Marrone’s punishment.

“This has been addressed internally and further details will not be made public,” Marrone said.

Rams crush Giants behind Goff and Gurley.

Jared Goff set career highs with four touchdown throws and 311 yards passing, Todd Gurley ran for two more scores and the surprising Los Angeles Rams made one big play after another in beating the defenseless New York Giants 51-17.

The win was the fifth in six games for the Rams, whose 6-2 start is the franchise’s best since 2001, when the club went 14-2 in the regular season and eventually lost to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.

Los Angeles did everything right in remaining unbeaten in four road games, five if a “home” win in London is included.

The Rams’ high-powered offense showed no rust coming off the bye, scoring on eight of their first nine possessions. The defense force three turnovers that the offense turned into 17 points and the special teams blocked a third-quarter punt that Gurley converted into his second touchdown.

Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil’s operations there. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.

Mr. Ross emerges as a particularly valued client for the offshore law firm, whose records provide more insight into his financial holdings beyond the public ethics disclosures he made upon joining the Trump administration. His ethics agreement filed in January listed the partnerships he intended to keep, but not the investments they held. Previously, Navigator had been mentioned in a separate, 57-page description of his holdings for the year that ended in December 2016, but with no hint of its ties to Sibur.

Sibur’s top ownership — including Gennady Timchenko, who is Mr. Putin’s friend and judo partner and is subject to American sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, who is married to the Russian president’s youngest daughter — makes it “a company with crony connections” in Moscow, said Daniel Fried, a Russia expert who served in senior State Department posts in Republican and Democratic administrations.

Another of Navigator’s major customers is PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company, controlled by the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on PDVSA this summer.

In a written response to questions by the Times, James Rockas, a spokesman for Mr. Ross, said that Navigator’s relationship with Sibur began before Mr. Ross joined the board in March 2012, and that he had never met the Russian oligarchs who are Sibur’s major shareholders. Public records show that Mr. Ross’s firm became a major investor in Navigator in November 2011, three months before the company chartered its first ships to Sibur.

“Sibur was not under sanctions at the time the contract was signed and is still not subject to sanctions,” Mr. Rockas said.

More broadly, he said that Mr. Ross “recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, but has been generally supportive of the administration’s sanctions of Russian and Venezuelan entities.”

“Secretary Ross has never had to seek, nor received, any ethics exemption,” Mr. Rockas said, “and he works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards.”

It is perhaps unsurprising that Navigator would have a relationship with a major Russian company during Mr. Ross’s tenure. Much like President Trump, whose company sought approval for a hotel project in Moscow as recently as last year, Mr. Ross has long shown an appreciation for the untapped potential of Russian markets when seeking investment opportunities. His involvement there dates at least to the 1990s, when he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the board of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund, established to promote American business interests in Russia.

In addition to Navigator, his firm also acquired a German rail car company, VTG, which pursued an expansion strategy in Russia before Mr. Ross sold his stake in 2016. And Mr. Ross led a private bailout of the Bank of Cyprus, long regarded as a favorite financial haven of wealthy Russians, after the worldwide economic crisis crippled the Cypriot banking system.

In the wake of reports of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, multiple investigations have explored potential business ties between Russia and members of the Trump administration. While several Trump campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny, until now no business connections have been reported between senior administration officials and members of Mr. Putin’s family or inner circle.

During Mr. Ross’s confirmation process, he was asked repeatedly about his business ties to Russia, mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he dealt with Russian investors but also forced some of them out of the bank. He was also asked about his investment in another shipping company, Diamond S, and whether its dealings with China could pose a conflict with his government duties. But he faced no questions about Navigator and its significant financial relationship with Sibur.

Mr. Rockas did not respond to questions about the current status of Mr. Ross’s investment. If Mr. Ross stands to benefit, albeit indirectly, from a Russian firm controlled by members of Mr. Putin’s inner circle, it poses a potential conflict with his role as the lead cabinet member on trade policy, ethics experts said. Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and has emerged as a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said that while Mr. Ross’s continued investment in Navigator would not violate any laws, it created other ethical concerns.

“Apart from those legal issues,” Mr. Painter said, “I’d be very concerned that someone in the U.S. government was making money from dealing with the Russians.”

As for Navigator, its leadership sees blue skies ahead with one of its key investors now at the helm of American trade policy.

On Nov. 30 of last year, hours after being nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross celebrated at Gramercy Tavern, an upscale Manhattan restaurant, at an event hosted by Navigator. He and David J. Butters, Navigator’s chief executive, arrived early to a private room and had a chat.

“Your interest is aligned to mine,” Mr. Butters recalls Mr. Ross saying, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. “The U.S. economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.”

Looking East

Mr. Ross’s foray into transoceanic shipping took off in 2011, when his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., assembled teams of investors to acquire major stakes in Diamond S Shipping and Navigator Holdings. Both firms specialized in chartering tankers to petroleum companies that need to move gas, oil and petrochemicals around the world. With Mr. Ross’s involvement, they would expand their business interests in China and Russia.

The investments — eventually totaling more than $600 million in Diamond S and about $240 million in Navigator — were in keeping with Mr. Ross’s strategy of scooping up shares in undervalued companies and turning them around. It is a business model that has earned Mr. Ross, a 79-year-old Ivy League-educated son of middle-class parents from New Jersey, the sobriquet of “king of bankruptcy.”

Over a lengthy investment career that included a stint running the bankruptcy advisory practice at the British banking firm Rothschild, he has breathed new life into textile, steel and auto-part businesses. While at Rothschild in the early 1990s, he led a group of bondholders in a restructuring of the floundering Trump casinos in Atlantic City, preserving a stake for Mr. Trump because, as he reportedly assured disgruntled investors, the Trump name was “still very much an asset.”

Mr. Ross’s business practices have occasionally drawn criticism for moving American jobs overseas in an effort to improve profits. A Reuters analysis of Labor Department statistics found that his takeovers shifted 2,700 jobs in automotive, textiles and mortgage finance to, among other places, China, India, Mexico and Nicaragua.

In the statement to The Times, Mr. Ross’s spokesman said, “Private equity firms have a responsibility to their investors to optimize corporate structures, and Secretary Ross has decades of experience that he is now using to benefit American workers.”

As worldwide shipping concerns, Diamond S and Navigator did not have much of a labor footprint in the United States when Mr. Ross and his investors took over. But the way both companies did business would pose potential conflicts with American interests in other ways.

Alongside Mr. Ross, another large investor in Diamond S was a company controlled by the Chinese government, according to securities filings. And Navigator signed a charter agreement with Sibur shortly after Mr. Ross’s firm made its investment. Sibur said in a statement that any negotiations with Navigator over the years were carried out by its executives, not its major shareholders, and that “no meetings were held with Mr. Ross.”

Initially, Navigator chartered two vessels to Sibur, and later increased the fleet to four. The relationship proved to be so profitable that Navigator’s chief executive, Mr. Butters, told investors in a 2016 conference call how Navigator benefited as Sibur beat out American competitors in the growing European energy market.

“Russia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into Europe, and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts, all in competition with longer-haul U.S. exports,” Mr. Butters said.

Putin Connections

As one of the largest gas companies in Russia, Sibur is not just any private business.

It was created by the Russian government and maintains a close dependency on Moscow, even after its sale in 2010 to Mr. Timchenko and Leonid Mikhelson. The two men are typical of Russian moguls who have benefited from state-owned assets and are expected to remain loyal to the Putin government, said Amos J. Hochstein, a top energy diplomat under the Obama administration.

“When you start doing business with Russian energy companies like Gazprom and Sibur, you’re not just getting into bed with the company,” Mr. Hochstein said. “You’re getting into bed with the Russian state.”

The ties to the Russian president, however, proved to be a double-edged sword for Sibur’s owners. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, American and Western allies imposed economic sanctions on key Putin associates, including Mr. Timchenko. A few months later, the United States barred banks from providing new financing to another gas company, Novatek, belonging to Mr. Mikhelson.

Sibur itself was not targeted. But financial institutions, including Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland, backed away from loans to the company, according to news reports at the time. Moscow stepped in to help in May 2014, when a government-backed financial consortium bought a shipping terminal from Sibur and pledged to expand export capacity, while allowing Sibur to remain the terminal’s sole exporter of gas.

Then, in September 2014, as sanctions pressure was growing, Mr. Timchenko reduced his holdings in Sibur by selling a 17 percent stake to a junior shareholder, Mr. Shamalov. A year earlier, Mr. Shamalov, whose father is a friend and former business partner of Mr. Putin’s, had married the Russian president’s daughter Katerina. His Sibur purchase, which pushed the 32-year-old Mr. Shamalov’s investment to more than 20 percent of the company, was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from the state-backed Gazprombank. Mr. Shamalov sold part of his stake in April, reducing it to 3.9 percent.

Most of these financial machinations were carried out through offshore companies on Cyprus, where Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko held their investments in Sibur and did business with several Cypriot banks. During the summer of 2014, Mr. Ross had become the Bank of Cyprus’s vice chairman, though there is no indication that he crossed paths with the two oligarchs during his tenure there.

His position at the bank required him to step down from the board of Navigator, however, even as he retained his investment in the company. His close associate at WL Ross & Co., Wendy L. Teramoto, took his place at Navigator and, later, left to join Mr. Ross as chief of staff at the Commerce Department.

Despite the reluctance of Western financial institutions to do business with Sibur and its owners, Navigator’s relationship with Sibur continued to grow.

From 2014 to 2015, the portion of Navigator’s total revenue that came from Sibur jumped to 9.1 percent from 5.3 percent, making the company one of its top five clients, according to securities filings, before dipping to 7.9 percent last year.

Ethics Disclosures

As WL Ross & Co. expanded over the years, it used Appleby, the offshore specialist, to set up an increasing number of entities in tax havens, many in the Cayman Islands. This British territory in the Caribbean levies no corporate or personal income tax on money earned outside its jurisdiction, and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. By 2014, Mr. Ross and his investment company were among Appleby’s top 20 clients.

After he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr. Ross filed an agreement with the federal Office of Government Ethics saying he would resign from WL Ross & Co. and divest from 80 companies and partnerships, but would keep a stake in nine others that held assets in “real estate financing and mortgage lending” and “transoceanic shipping.” The underlying assets were not specified.

Photo

His financial disclosure form offered more detail, including a list of assets that had been held by each of the partnerships that he retained. Navigator Holdings appeared in connection with four Appleby-managed Cayman partnerships. Mr. Ross’s ethics filing valued his stake in those partnerships at between $2.05 million and $10.1 million, a fraction of the partnerships’ combined 31.5 percent stake in Navigator, which, based on the firm’s recent stock price, was worth roughly $179 million. In all, WL Ross & Co. remains Navigator’s largest shareholder, according to the shipping company’s most recent annual report.

Federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have “a direct and predictable” effect on their financial interests or cause a reasonable doubt about their impartiality. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his continued business holdings and his cabinet post.

“I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt,” he said.",Commerce Secretary’s Offshore Ties to Putin ‘Cronies’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/wilbur-ross-russia.html

Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.

No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.

A Russian Billionaire Investor’s Stake in American Technology Companies The Kremlin controls Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank. Gazprom Investholding lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Kanton Services. Kanton Services owned DST USA II, which was used to invest in Facebook. VTB Bank gave $191 million to DST Investments 3 for its stake in Twitter. The venture capitalist Yuri Milner founded DST Global, which managed DST USA II and DST Investments 3.

Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America’s technology giants.

“Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind — not just commercial interests but state interests as well,” said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. “They go hand in hand.”

Mr. Carpenter added, “Oligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia’s crony capitalist system.”

There is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.

As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple — “nothing more than business,” he said, adding: “We are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it’s a commercial arrangement.”

(A statement from DST Global, Mr. Milner’s venture capital firm, appears here.)

The Path to Silicon Valley

Mr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.

He returned to Russia and in the late 1990s and worked as an executive at Bank Menatep, which was founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil tycoon who was stripped of his company, prosecuted and imprisoned after a televised confrontation with President Vladimir V. Putin.

Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov — an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev — and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.

Mr. Milner’s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia’s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.

In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner’s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner’s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.

“A number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said at the time.

The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection — through a succession of shell companies — to the Kremlin.

Ties to the Russian State

In those years, as part of its diplomatic “reset” with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia’s dependence on exporting oil and gas.

For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.

Gazprom Investholding is “used for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,” said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding’s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Over several years, Gazprom Investholding and a subsidiary made hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to a company called Kanton Services, according to records from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. Kanton, in turn, owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook. While it is unclear precisely when Kanton first received its stake in the DST entity, Kanton received $197 million of the Gazprom Investholding loans three months before Facebook announced its first deal with Mr. Milner, the records show.

Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner’s backer, Mr. Usmanov.

Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov’s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a “private investment company, (facebook and twitter).”

In the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors’ identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. “I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,” he said. What’s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.

Photo

To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like “Alleged Russian government funds,” “Mr. Usmanov” and “Facebook.” He pulled out a large bag of green M&M’s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M’s from one cup to another. “Money is fungible,” he explained, adding, “You can’t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.”

A spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, “did not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.”

Lucrative ‘Synergies’

The Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia’s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government’s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.

In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as “synergies.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

The Kroll report — a “reputation audit” — had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.

The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals — involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. “Usmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the ‘most improved’ oligarch over the past eight years,” one source told Kroll.

Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner’s Facebook investment.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a “passive investor” and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.

Gazprom Investholding called the loans “prudent,” saying they were “provided for general corporate purposes” at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he “operated in accordance” with the company’s charter.

To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.

After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.

Photo

In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company’s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.

At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. “I think it’s actually the opposite,” he replied. “I sometimes get informal advice from them.”

Obscure Financial Maneuvers

Mr. Milner’s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB.

Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB’s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank’s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.

VTB has operations across the world, including in the United States. In recent years, it has been involved in a number of politically sensitive deals, including a loan that financed the Russian government’s murky privatization of 19.5 percent of the oil giant Rosneft.

Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.

Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers “unsubstantiated.”

Photo

“VTB is really a slush fund for Putin,” said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is “the black cashier of the Putin crowd.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Milner’s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB’s involvement.

In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global’s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.

The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.

On May 7, 2014 — six months after Twitter’s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares — VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.

DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.

In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was “solely a financial investment,” sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, “VTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.”

Twitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.

Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.

Beyond Social Media

Mr. Milner has also been active beyond Silicon Valley. He is a founder of the Breakthrough Prize, a series of lucrative scientific awards. And in July 2015, he was one of several high-profile investors in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother, Joshua. (Other investors and partners include Goldman Sachs, George Soros and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.)

Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global’s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.

Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.

Photo

In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.

Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, “if you’re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it’s easy to say, ‘Please don’t get involved in politics.’”

That “was my principle back then and still now,” he said, adding: “I prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy. And this is plenty for me.”",Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire’s Twitter and Facebook Investments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

COLORADO SPRINGS — The 26-year-old gunman who entered a rural Texas church with a ballistic vest and a military-style rifle, killing at least 26 people on Sunday, had been trailed by trouble for years. Devin Patrick Kelley, a former member of the United States Air Force, had been convicted at court-martial and jailed for domestic abuse, kicked out of the military, divorced and charged with animal cruelty.

In 2012, while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Mr. Kelley was charged with “assault on his spouse and assault on their child” according to Ann Stefanek, the Air Force’s chief of media operations. He was convicted at court-martial and sentenced in November of that year to twelve months confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank, E-1. After his confinement, he was discharged from the military with a bad conduct discharge. It is unclear whether his conviction would have barred him from purchasing a gun.

That same year, he was divorced in New Mexico from his first wife, according to court records. When he was discharged from the Air Force in 2014, Mr. Kelley remarried in Texas to Danielle Lee Shields in April of that year, according to state records.

A few months later he registered to vote in Colorado Springs — a city with several Air Force bases — listing his address as parking space 60 at a shabby collection of trailers in a gravel lot called the Fountain Creek RV Park.

A woman living in a camper next door, who gave her name only as Susan, said a man of similar age and description lived in spot 60 for a few months during that time, but she never learned his name.

“He was kind of off, lived here with a woman,” she said as she loaded blankets into one of the RV Park’s washing machines.

He said hello a few times in passing but was never friendly and stayed only a few months. She never heard any arguments from his trailer.

“The only thing that sticks out about him was his dog,” she said.

He had a pit bull puppy that he kept tied up in the sun all day outside of his RV, she said. She also recalled an incident where police were called because the man had struck the dog in the head.

The police arrived and there was a standoff for approximately an hour, she said, in which her neighbor refused to come out of his trailer.

Records show Mr. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, in August 2014. The case was dismissed. He moved out a few weeks later, she said.

Mr. Kelley, whose father, Michael Kelley, is a computer programmer and accountant, enlisted in the Air Force soon after graduating from New Braunfels High School in 2009. Devin Kelly served as a low-ranking airman in a logistics readiness battalion. A Linkedin account in his name says he worked in cargo and distribution.

By 2017 he had returned to a house in New Braunfels that records show was owned by his parents. The house was about an hour from the church where the shooting occurred.

Michael Kelley, in a short biography posted on the website of his small software company, Dilloware, said the family has three children. Devin Kelley is the middle child.

“Building the company at the same time as our family involved a whirlwind of activity,” he wrote. “Lots of late hours and sacrifices.”

On Sunday, police cars from the Comal County Sheriff’s Department lined the gunman’s driveway on a rural stretch of land in New Braunfels. Wire fences kept visitors from the house, which was hidden by overgrown grass that fills the property.

Signs on a cattle gate at the entrance read “no trespassing” and “beware of dog”.

“I don’t know anybody down there,” said Sabas Gonzales, who can see Mr. Kelley’s driveway from hers. Ms. Gonzalez, 70, said she’d lived there for more than two decades and many of her neighbors had come over to introduce themselves when they moved in, but nobody from Mr. Kelley’s home ever stopped by.

“Out here, people tend to keep to themselves,” said Tim Daughtrey, who cuts cedar for clients in the area, and lives in walking distance from Mr. Kelley’s home. Mr. Daughtrey, 40, said the town was mostly uneventful, as far as crime goes. “I see a barroom fight every now and then, but never no shootings.”",Texas Gunman Led Troubled Life Before Church Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/devin-patrick-kelley-texas.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Those numbers are expected to rise in the coming weeks, as filing and fund-raising deadlines for next year’s election approach. Just how high could depend on the success or failure of Republicans’ latest legislative push, an ambitious rewrite of the federal tax code that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has pledged to get through the chamber in a matter of weeks. Should the effort fail, current and former lawmakers said, the number of demoralized Republicans leaving the chamber could jump.

“Each of us will have our own individual stories, but the promise of unified government is much more difficult, cumbersome and elusive than we ever thought it would be,” said Mr. Chaffetz, 50, who stepped down in June to take a job at Fox News. “You have people who are frustrated they can’t get their legislation to the finish line.”

Republican campaign strategists and congressional aides said they were watching at least two other committee chairmen facing term limits for potential retirements: Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, who is the chairman of the Transportation Committee, and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Smith, a long-serving conservative and former Judiciary Committee chairman, said the decision to retire was largely personal. He wrote on Thursday that with his chairmanship ending and a new grandchild arriving, the time felt right to step aside after 16 terms.

“It is humbling living in a small apartment in Washington four nights a week,” he wrote. “And I seldom leave the office before late at night.”

Mr. Smith took over the science panel in 2013 and turned it into a powerful counterweight to Obama administration environmental policy. He subpoenaed scientists, accused federal agencies working on climate change of engaging in scientific fraud and supported stripping NASA of much of its climate change research. News of his departure has been as polarizing as his chairmanship.

Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, and a leading contrarian of the scientific consensus on global warming, said Mr. Smith’s retirement was a “huge loss to the science community.”

Scientists who have clashed with him, though, said they were hopeful that his departure would mark a return to a less adversarial body.

“Chairman Smith misused his position to subpoena federal researchers, sow doubt about scientific facts and push bills that would undermine the role of science in policy,” said Andrew Rosenberg, the director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“I hope that the next representative to serve as chair will return this committee to its intended purpose: strengthening America’s scientific enterprise, providing thoughtful and constructive oversight of federal policy and protecting the health and safety of the people Congress is supposed to serve,” he said.

Mr. Hensarling, 60, cut a less divisive but still influential figure on Capitol Hill. As chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Hensarling was one of the House’s leading lieutenants in the Republican fight to scale back the government’s role in regulating the economy. In June, the House passed Mr. Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act, which would dismantle many of the Obama-era banking regulations codified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

He also broke with big business in his crusade to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, the government agency that guarantees loans for the overseas customers of American exporters. That effort put him at odds with many members of his party, even on his committee.

The push has so far failed, but the agency’s largest transactions have been crippled for nearly two and a half years by conservative actions on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Hensarling, who has been in the House since 2003, wrote in a letter explaining his decision on Tuesday that he had already stayed longer in Washington than he had intended and the end of his chairmanship provided a natural break. And given his position, he will be a strong candidate for a lucrative next act in the private sector.

But his work in Washington was marked by frustration, as well. A sign of how difficult it has been to see legislation into law: His Financial Choice Act stands a slim chance of passing the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority.

Dick Armey, a former House majority leader under Mr. Gingrich and a fellow Texan, said Mr. Hensarling’s departure struck him as premature and a casualty of the sort that Republicans had brought upon themselves.

“I have no doubt he’s frustrated,” Mr. Armey said. “You can’t be as able and as innovative a guy as Jeb is without being frustrated right now.”

Others drew different lessons.

Representative Louie Gohmert, a Tea Party conservative who has clashed with party leadership over the years, said the departures of his fellow Texans, Mr. Smith and Mr. Hensarling, were merely part of the natural cycle of life in the House.

“Nobody lasts up here forever,” Mr. Gohmert said as he left the House floor on Thursday. “And if they do, they shouldn’t.”","Departures Promise to Reshape the House, Whether or Not Election Does",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/politics/house-republican-retirements-midterms-hensarling-smith.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.
The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers.
One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.","Some of that is simply politics. But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

A Lesson to Learn?

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

Administrators whose most solemn responsibility was protecting children instead chose to look the other way and protect child abusers. The music teacher, a cultish figure named Johannes Somary, was the worst abuser during my time. One of his victims later committed suicide.

The current torrent of harassment revelations — following Jodi Kantor’s and Megan Twohey’s Times exposé of Harvey Weinstein — has caused me to think back on high school again, because every big case has had something in common with Horace Mann.

People knew.

Even if they didn’t know the details — I didn’t know what Somary was actually doing — they knew that something was wrong. At Fox News, many knew that Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly mistreated women. At ABC, The New Republic and NPR, respectively, people talked about the harassment by Mark Halperin, Leon Wieseltier and Michael Oreskes. In Hollywood, people talked about Weinstein and Kevin Spacey — not to mention Donald Trump, who nonetheless became a heavily promoted reality star.

As the screenwriter Scott Rosenberg has written about Weinstein, “Everybody knew.” (The full quotation includes a colloquial adverb of emphasis between “everybody” and “knew.”)

“Maybe we didn’t know the degree. The magnitude of the awfulness,” Rosenberg continued. “But we knew something.”

And yet no one did anything about it. People were afraid to, or didn’t know how. So they — we — became part of an unwitting conspiracy of inaction.

This conspiracy has spanned the relatively powerless, like interns, secretaries and teenagers, to the wealthy and famous, as well as every level of power in between. Jill Abramson, my old boss, is one of the toughest journalists I know. Still, as a midlevel manager two decades ago, she didn’t go over the head of her old boss — Oreskes — to report his behavior at The Times, as she regretfully said last week.

Post-Weinstein, the emphasis has been on holding other abusers accountable. So far, each seems to deserve his delayed consequences. (And, yes, the severity of the various abuses varies.) I hope the exposés continue.

But post facto truth and punishment are not enough. We also need to figure out how to prevent future abuse. We need to make inaction feel unacceptable.

Doing so will require changes from both organizations and individuals. Every workplace and school should be asking itself: Do people here know how to report a suspicion of abuse? Do they feel comfortable doing so even when, as is typical, they have only an incomplete sense of it?

At most places, the answers remain no and no.

Organizations need “multiple, accessible avenues of complaint,” as a federal task force concluded. These avenues should be blazingly obvious, not buried in a corporate policy that nobody reads. They should include anonymous reporting options. They should feed into a process that’s confidential and fair, including to the accused.

Every leader should also read case studies, to understand how frequently other leaders, at Horace Mann, NPR and elsewhere, have bungled these situations, usually through cowardice. Often, a victim or someone else did summon the courage to come forward, only to have the institution do little or nothing.

But the changes can’t be only about policies and organizations. They need to be personal, too. I’m guessing that you get angry when you think about the abuse committed by Weinstein, O’Reilly, Trump or Somary — about the long-lasting misery they have inflicted on other human beings. I certainly do.

The next time I see something that doesn’t seem quite right, I’m going to remember that anger. One conspiracy of inaction is more than enough for a lifetime.",The Conspiracy of Inaction on Sexual Abuse and Harassment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/opinion/sexual-harassment-weinstein-horace-mann.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean? I stared at my mostly finished grid and then I saw it. Running down the center of the grid was the phrase HEAVY METAL BANDS. And across the center of the top three grids was POINT BLANK RANGE.

O.K., Mr. Arbesfeld, now I’ve got you. Across the middle of my grid, I had ___ OPTIC CABLE, so I filled in FIBER across the middle of grid No. 4. Sure enough, it was an answer and I conquered that grid.

Since this is the first appearance of a Walls and Doors puzzle, I asked Mr. Arbesfeld to tell me a bit about how it came to be:

Constructor Notes

I got the idea initially from a Sunday puzzle back in January called “Rolling in the Aisles,” in which the word HA was used as a rebus for Down clues, but yet blocked off from the accompanying Across clues. It seemed to me that the Across clues had walls, while the Down clues had doors. I think this also struck a chord for me because of the 2016 election, in which one candidate talked of building walls while the other wanted to open doors. And finally, there’s a Jackson Browne song I love with the same title. I initially created it in a more traditional crossword puzzle manner for a Thursday, but found that it was too easy. So then I hit upon the idea of making each of the nine 5x5 sections its own puzzle, with the six interlocking 15-letter entries running through. This seemed much more suitable as a Sunday Variety puzzle, so I presented it to Will Shortz as such.

I really enjoyed this puzzle, with its roller coaster ride of mulling over clues and conquering grids. I would definitely do one of these again.",Variety Puzzle: Walls and Doors,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/crosswords/variety-puzzle-walls-and-doors.html

Now the I.O.C. and Russian officials are engaged in a doping stare down. Many athletes, antidoping officials and Olympics officials from some countries are urging Thomas Bach, president of the I.O.C., to issue severe penalties.

The top Olympic officials are also considering the option of having Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag at the Pyeongchang Games or wear neutral uniforms, according to the people familiar with the case. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The I.O.C. is unlikely to impose a total ban on Russia, an Olympic heavyweight, though it could issue a significant financial penalty, expel athletes and officials found to have been part of the doping scheme and remove any mention of Russia from the field of play, according to the people.

Russian officials have threatened to pull their athletes out of the Pyeongchang Games altogether if the sanctions are too harsh.

A decision is expected to be made on Dec. 5, when the I.O.C’s executive board meets. Before then the officials will receive the results of a much-delayed study by the former Swiss president Samuel Schmid into McLaren’s report, which linked several state organs, including the intelligence agency FSB, to the doping conspiracy.

A group of 17 national antidoping agencies published a letter in September demanding that Russia be excluded from the Pyeongchang Games.

“The failure to expeditiously investigate individual Russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 Winter Games,” said the letter, whose signatories included the United States and British antidoping agencies.

Russia is expected to react with fury, and even withdraw its team from the Winter Games, if the I.O.C. issues a severe punishment. The Pyeongchang Olympics are scheduled to take place about six weeks before President Vladimir Putin stands for re-election.

“The position is unequivocal for all — Russians will not compete under the neutral flag at the Olympic Games,” Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russia’s Olympic committee, said in comments published on the Russian website R-Sport. “They will speak for their country. This option is not even being considered.”

The late rush to settle on a punishment is a repeat of events ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Then, in the wake of Dr. Rodchenkov’s revelations, the I.O.C ordered individual sports federations to determine the eligibility of Russian athletes for those Games. Some, like cycling, rowing and track and field, adopted blanket bans, while others admitted athletes who could prove they were clean.

Last week at a meeting of the 205 eligible Olympic nations and territories, Bach said that any manipulation of samples at Sochi would constitute a “direct attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on the I.O.C.” But since the start of the crisis he has emphasized his opposition to “collective punishment,” preferring that each athlete have a chance to establish his innocence.

Bach has forcefully pushed back at calls for the I.O.C. to act more swiftly against Russia. He has said that punishments cannot be determined before the I.O.C.’s inquiries had been completed. The I.O.C. also commissioned an investigation by the head of its disciplinary commission, Denis Oswald, into possible doping violations by individual athletes at the Sochi, London and Beijing Games.

“In the Olympic movement everybody — when we say everybody it is everybody — everybody enjoys the same rights and obligations and everyone enjoys the right to a fair and due procedure,’’ Bach said. “I call all of you to respect this fair procedure for all our colleagues, because we always think how you would react if you were accused of some wrongdoings and what you would expect from your colleagues.”

No winter sports federation has publicly supported a total ban of Russian athletes at the Pyeongchang Games.

Last week the I.O.C penalized the first two athletes following Oswald’s investigation. The Russian cross country skiers Alexander Legkov and Evgeniy Belov were banned for life for doping violations at the Sochi Games.

Dr. Rodchenkov said Russia tampered with urine samples that would have failed drug tests in Sochi. Oswald’s commission has taken longer than first anticipated to reach verdicts after it struggled to come up with a suitable method of detecting whether bottles — previously considered tamper-proof — had been manipulated.

McLaren’s report captured the scale and audaciousness of Russia’s doping program, using forensic analysis to corroborate the testimony of Dr. Rodchenkov. The report said the drug tests of about 1,000 athletes — across several Olympics — were corrupted, but acknowledged that proving wrongdoing for individual cases would be difficult given Russia’s lack of cooperation in providing lab data and its history of destroying tainted urine samples that would be plainly incriminating.

The World Anti-Doping Agency has cleared 95 of the first 96 athletes whose cases of doping in competitions have been reviewed.

The agency in 2015 declared Russia noncompliant with global sports’ accepted antidoping code. Among several requirements for regaining compliance, the agency said, Russian antidoping authorities must publicly accept the findings in McLaren’s report and the Russian government must provide access to the stored urine samples in the Moscow laboratory.

Russia has not fulfilled either of those demands yet. Russian officials have cited an ongoing FSB investigation for refusing WADA access to lab samples and data.

World Anti-Doping Agency leaders will meet on Nov. 16 to decide whether Russia should once again be considered compliant.
