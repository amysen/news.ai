The House tax-writing committee begins revising the bill on Monday with tweaks and some more substantial changes expected to a number of individual and corporate tax proposals.

House Republicans last week unveiled the first draft of a 429-page tax bill that, if enacted, would be the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s.

It proposes a range of tax cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishing a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which are currently taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent.

House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox New Sunday that there are a “host of ideas” being considered as lawmakers begin revising the bill, though he expected the broad outlines to remain the same.

One controversial component for lawmakers from high-tax states repeals a popular federal tax deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments, while preserving a deduction for property tax payments, capped at $10,000 per year.

House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady worked out a compromise last week that preserved the deduction for property taxes after pushback from Republicans representing states such as New Jersey, New York and California, which would be disproportionately hit by the repeal.

States that would be hit hard by the elimination of a SALT deduction have enough Republican members in Congress to derail the tax legislation. Many have already said they would like to see the cap raised on the property-tax deduction or the income-tax deduction retained.

The Senate is developing its own version of the legislation and it would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to President Donald Trump.

On Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Vice President Mike Pence called the House bill a “great start.”

“We look forward to the Senate bringing forward the tax cut, the key here is that whatever is accomplished reflects the President’s commitment to cutting taxes on working families,” said Pence, who would be the tie-breaker if needed in a Senate vote.

If Republicans pass tax legislation, it will be the first major legislative achievement since Republicans took control of the White House and Congress in January - and a rebound from their failure to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

Ryan said on Sunday that he still believes the House is on track to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.",House begins revising Republican tax bill to quell dissent,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/house-begins-revising-republican-tax-bill-to-quell-dissent-idUSKBN1D6180

Other members of the consortium include Norwegian oil firm Statoil, trading houses Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria, and banks ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale.

Blockchain technology, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, uses a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.

Mercuria has been a vocal advocate of implementing blockchain technology to significantly cut costs in oil trading.

“Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,” said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC.

Similar efforts for an energy trading platform have failed to take off, Bell said, but added this latest bid with backing from BP and Shell and the banks, “may have more success than if it were an independent party trying to convince oil and gas companies to make use of it.”

The new venture is seeking regulatory approvals and would be run as an independent entity, the consortium said in a statement.

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

FILE PHOTO: One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-offers-103-billion-for-qualcomm-sets-up-takeover-battle-idUKKBN1D61EK

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition’s announcement.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

The chairman of the Dubai state-owned port operator, Sultan bin Sulayem, and Somaliland’s foreign minister Saad Ali Shire signed the agreement in Dubai on Monday to develop the Berbera Free Zone, DP World said in a statement.

A 12.2 square kilometre area has been earmarked for the greenfield economic zone, which will target sectors such as logistics and manufacturing. The project will be developed in phases starting with an initial 4 square km.

The state-owned Middle Eastern carrier is buying nearly 10 percent of its struggling Hong Kong counterpart for about $661 million. That may not be a money-spinner for the Qataris, but it will certainly complicate any future manoeuvring over Cathay’s ownership.

The deal, unveiled on Monday, looks partly like a consolation prize. Qatar Airways recently had to drop a controversial attempt to buy a chunk of American Airlines. But the company is still following a trajectory similar to Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, gobbling up minority stakes left and right.

True, the airline is a more natural investor than the seller, Kingboard Chemical, a bargain-hunting group whose day job is making laminates, chemicals and circuit boards. And the duo, who are already partners in the Oneworld alliance, could reap some benefits from collaborating more closely: Corrine Png of Crucial Perspective says this could cover areas like cross-marketing and joint procurement.

Still, Etihad and others show the perils of airlines dabbling in portfolio-building. This can tie up funds in a capital-hungry industry, and the buyer gets little clout in return. Such deal-making also tends to concentrate on cheaper, more distressed carriers.

It is not clear if Qatar Airways will even get a board seat in this deal. And while the airline characterises this as a financial investment, it is unlikely to be lucrative, at least in the short term. Analysts expect Cathay to record a loss this year, and be barely profitable in 2018. A price of HK$13.65 a share equates to about 16 times estimated earnings in 2019: hardly a bargain.

On the other hand, the stake does give Qatar Airways a seat at the table if Cathay were to be put up for sale. It is 45 percent owned by Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and 30 percent by mainland carrier Air China. Swire has remained committed despite Cathay’s recent difficulties. But should it decide to quit or sell down, it now has two suitors to play against each other, assuming national ownership hurdles can be overcome.",Breakingviews - Qatar Airways gets seat for any Cathay dealmaking,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-qatar-airways-gets-seat-for-any-cathay-dealmaking-idUSKBN1D60CK

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

“I heard that (the in-laws) attended church from time to time,” Tackitt said. “Not on a regular basis.”

The attack, which killed people ranging from 18 months to 77 years old, came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest by a single gunman in the United States.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

Allowing Northern Ireland to retain some access has been floated by the European Parliament’s Brexit pointman, Guy Verhofstadt.

“We will leave the European Union in 2019 as one United Kingdom,” the British minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said on Monday. “We need to ensure that nothing is done that undermines the integrity of the UK single market.”

“I find it difficult to image how Northern Ireland could somehow remain in while the rest of the country leaves. I find it impossible,” he told a seminar in Brussels.

Brokenshire reiterated Prime Minister Theresa May’s insistence that the United Kingdom would be exiting both as a result of the 2016 referendum.

London has proposed an “invisible border” without border posts or immigration checks between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. But it has given no firm ideas on customs arrangements and the EU side has been mostly critical, saying these plans are unrealistic.

Dublin has said it will not let Brexit negotiations move from the divorce talks to discussions about future trade relations between Britain and the EU - as London is pushing for - without more guarantees on the border.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has demanded more guarantees that the Irish issue would be solved even if the future trade talks between Britain and the remaining 27 EU states collapse.

Brokenshire said some agricultural laws in Northern Ireland -- which is trying to reach agreement on how to relaunch its regional executive that is ruled at arm’s length from London -- were already different than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

He signaled Belfast could keep some of its laws closer to those of the EU after Brexit to minimize trade disruptions across the future border.

He also said London was keen to preserve the single electricity market on the island of Ireland and hoped for close cooperation with Dublin, including on security matters, after Britain leaves, as is now due to happen in March, 2019.

First Secretary of State Damian Green said the claims by a former senior police officer in a Sunday newspaper were “completely untrue” and “political smears.”

“This story is completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source,” Green said in a statement on his Twitter page. The claims amount to “little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,” he said.

The Sunday Times reported on its front page that former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Bob Quick alleged the material was discovered by officers during an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.

Quick, who was involved in the leak investigation, told the newspaper that officers had reported finding the “extreme” pornography on a parliamentary computer from Green’s office.

The claims against one of the prime minister’s closest allies risks deepening a growing sexual harassment scandal that led Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign last Wednesday.

Fallon said his behavior has “fallen short” of the standards expected by the British military.

May’s minority government is already struggling with divisions over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Britain’s interior minister Amber Rudd said the issue would be investigated by the Cabinet Office on Monday and she denied the government was on the verge of collapse if Green resigned.

Rudd said Britain needed to address allegations of sexual harassment in the corridors of power.

“It is something that will take place, in terms of clearing out Westminster of that sort of behavior, and Westminster, including the government, will be better off after it,” she said.

Green, 61, has also denied a previous allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman.

He said it was not true that he had touched the woman’s knee and told her that his “wife was very understanding” during a meeting in a pub in which the pair discussed her career aspirations and gossiped about sexual affairs in parliament.",PM May's deputy denies report pornography was found on office computer,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-green/mays-deputy-denies-report-pornography-was-found-on-office-computer-idUKKBN1D50J8

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

Com isso, a Petrobras disse que vai complementar essa avaliação através de uma opinião da consultoria DeGolyer and MacNaughton, que estará disponível em aproximadamente 30 dias.

“A existência de volumes excedentes nas áreas sob Cessão Onerosa constitui oportunidade para ambas as partes, Governo e Petrobras, construírem um acordo relacionado ao ressarcimento à Petrobras no processo de Revisão do Contrato”, disse a Petrobras.

Segundo a companhia, a contratação da consultoria para avaliar as reservas excedentes visa “embasar uma eventual negociação”.

Os dados da ANP tiveram como base laudo da Gaffney, Cline & Associates.

A agência disse que a certificadora apontou 90 por cento de chance de o excedente da cessão onerosa ter cerca de 6 bilhões de barris ou mais. Haveria, ainda, 10 por cento de probabilidade de que a área tenha cerca de 15 bilhões de barris de óleo equivalente ou mais.

CESSÃO ONEROSA

O contrato de cessão onerosa entre Petrobras e União, assinado em 2010, deu à Petrobras o direito de produzir até 5 bilhões de barris em áreas do pré-sal.

A estatal pagou na época 42,5 bilhões de dólares ao governo federal pelo direito de explorar a região, mas estava prevista uma renegociação do contrato no futuro, após a declaração de comercialidade das áreas.

A Petrobras disse que, como resultado das atividades sob contrato da cessão onerosa, foram declaradas as comercialidades dos campos de Búzios, Sépia, Itapu, Sul de Lula, Sul de Sapinhoá, Norte e Sul de Berbigão, Norte e Sul de Sururu e Atapu.

“O início da produção comercial se dará no primeiro semestre de 2018”, disse a companhia no comunicado.

Segundo a Petrobras, após sete anos de atividades na região, com perfuração de mais de 50 poços e testes de produção de longa duração, “foi possível concluir que há volumes superiores aos 5 bilhões de barris equivalentes contratados originalmente.”

A companhia disse que, para dar suporte à revisão do contrato, havia contratado laudo da DeGolyer and MacNaughton, mas este não previa avaliação de cenários de volumes excedentes.

Nos últimos meses, a Petrobras vem cobrando da União uma revisão do contrato da cessão onerosa, com uma visão de que a companhia hoje seria credora do governo, devido à queda dos preços do petróleo desde o acordo original.

O governo, no entanto, tem dito que não há uma posição pacífica sobre a revisão do contrato favorecer a Petrobras.

Segundo as autoridades, as negociações entre as partes deveriam começar logo após a divulgação dos números da ANP sobre os excedentes na região da cessão onerosa.

Representantes do governo têm falado na possibilidade de licitar os direitos de exploração dos excedentes, o que poderia inclusive arrecadar recursos para pagar a Petrobras caso a companhia realmente se mostre credora na renegociação sobre as áreas.",Petrobras deve produzir em áreas da cessão onerosa em 2018; vê excedente menor que ANP,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1D61J8-OBRBS

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

FILE PHOTO: One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-offers-103-billion-for-qualcomm-sets-up-takeover-battle-idUSKBN1D61EO

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

An autopsy will determine the cause of death, Martin said.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said in an interview that the family members had not been present at the time of Kelley’s attack

“I heard that (the in-laws) attended church from time to time,” Tackitt said. “Not on a regular basis.”

The attack, which killed people ranging from 18 months to 77 years old, came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest by a single gunman in the United States.

Officials warned that 10 of the wounded remained in critical condition on Monday morning.","Texas church gunman sent threatening texts to in-laws, officials say",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-texas-shooting/texas-gunmans-in-laws-sometimes-attended-church-sheriff-says-idUKKBN1D510H

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.
But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

TRADE DEFICITS

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

EMPEROR, ABDUCTEES

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

The subject’s inclusion on the monthly meeting’s agenda came after the weekend publication of media reports citing the so-called “Paradise Papers”, a trove of leaked financial documents mostly from Appleby, a prominent offshore law firm.

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified them. Appleby was not immediately available for comment.

EU countries had planned for months to reach an agreement on a blacklist for tax havens by the end of this year. The new revelations prompted the discussion to be brought forward, EU officials said, but no final decision was expected on Tuesday.

The EU has discussed several measures to crack down on tax avoidance in the past, including in the wake of the “Panama Papers”, a release by the ICIJ last year which chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Measures previously discussed include an EU-wide list of tax havens meant to discourage the rerouting of profits made in the EU to tax-free or low-tax countries, like Panama or Bermuda.

At the moment, each EU country has its own list of jurisdictions that are seen as less cooperative on tax matters. Criteria to define a tax haven vary greatly among EU states and some of them include no jurisdictions in their national blacklists.

An EU blacklist is believed to carry more weight. Jurisdictions included in the list could be subject to sanctions if they did not cooperate.

There are no details yet of the type of sanctions to be discussed, although being on the blacklist in itself could discourage individuals and companies from putting money in those jurisdictions.

Some EU countries remain sceptical about the blacklist and are themselves under scrutiny for unfair tax competition.

Smaller EU states, like Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, attract firms with lower corporate taxes. Some have been sanctioned for deals with multinationals that slashed their tax bills, reducing revenues in other EU states.

To win over their resistance, the proposed EU blacklist would apply only to non-EU countries. Also, states which charge no corporate taxes will not be automatically considered tax havens, under a preliminary deal reached by EU finance ministers last year.

On tax matters the EU can take decisions only with the unanimous backing of its 28 member states, unless extraordinary procedures are launched - an option never tested so far.

To reduce the appeal of tax havens, Brussels has also proposed the setting up of public registries that would show the real owners of companies, which are often hidden by frontmen in shell firms in offshore jurisdictions.

It has also proposed compulsory reporting by large multinational firms of profits made and taxes paid in each state where they operate, in a bid to show how much of their revenues are booked in low-tax countries.

EU states have been long discussing both proposals, but no deal has been reached yet. “EU governments such as Germany have been standing against the rising tide of financial transparency,” said Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International EU.",EU to discuss blacklist of tax havens after 'Paradise Papers' leaks,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-ecofin-taxavoidance/eu-to-discuss-blacklist-of-tax-havens-after-paradise-papers-leaks-idINKBN1D618Q

Around 43 million voters have been registered for the vote so far, Corneille Nangaa told a news conference in Democratic Republic of Congo’s capital, Kinshasa.

The election will be held on December 23, 2018, with the results to be published on January 9, 2019, and the president to be sworn in on January 13, another official from the Independent Electoral Commission (CENI), Jean Pierre Kalamba, told the same news conference.

The election, originally scheduled for late 2016, has been repeatedly delayed.

Those delays have triggered unrest and raised fears the central African nation could slip back into the conflicts that killed millions around the turn of the century, mostly from hunger and disease.

The electoral commission had said last month that the presidential vote could not take place until April 2019 at the earliest, and the opposition had warned that the population would “take matters into its own hands”.

Opposition leaders reacted furiously to the new date.

“The predatory regime wants to prolong the instability and misery of the people. We do not accept this fantasy calendar,” exiled opposition leader Moise Katumbi tweeted.

Civil society activist organization Lucha on Twitter also condemned the announcement.

Dozens died in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support.

With no imminent election in sight, a political crisis has set in that is fuelling increasing militia violence and lawlessness in Congo’s east and center.

Clashes between Congolese troops and supporters of a renegade colonel in Congo’s eastern city of Bukavu killed seven people on Sunday before he surrendered and turned himself in to U.N. peacekeepers.

Kabila has ruled Congo since his father was assassinated in 2001. He says delays are owing to problems registering millions of voters across the vast, forested country.

Opponents say he is using them to eventually remove term limits that prevent him from standing again, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done.

The heavily Christian community set amid farmlands and rolling hills about 40 miles (65 km) east of San Antonio is too small to have its own police force, and much of its social activity is centered on its two churches.

They include the modest, white-painted First Baptist Church, where a lone gunman burst in brandishing an assault rifle during a Sunday service and killed at least 26 parishioners.

“We wouldn’t believe that something like this would happen here,” Paul Buford, pastor of River Oaks Church, the other house of worship in Sutherland Springs, told reporters.

“We are holding up as well as we can. We are a strong community. We are strong in our faith and strong in believing that anyone that was killed in the church there is present with our Lord,” he said.

Authorities did not name the gunman, but the New York Times and other media cited unnamed law enforcement officials who said he was a white, 26-year-old man, Devin Patrick Kelley. Soon after the shooting, the suspect crashed his vehicle near the border of neighboring Guadalupe County and was found dead inside with a cache of weapons.

In a small town like Sutherland Springs, everyone will be affected by the shooting, Buford said. Police said the youngest shooting victim was five years old.

The massacre came only about a month after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history when a gunman killed 58 people at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas.

The killings have stoked a simmering national debate about how easy access to firearms contributes to the carnage.

Many Sutherland Springs residents said their town is safe, the people are friendly, and that what happened was unthinkable.

“Most people go to a small town to get away from stuff like that. That’s why they come here. They never expected that to happen, not in a million years,” said Chris Speer, 33, who works as a clerk at the gas station a block from the church.

He was sitting outside the store when the bullets began flying. He ran inside to take cover, his 11-month-old son clinging to his leg.

“There was nothing I could do but protect him,” he said.

Sutherland Springs started life as a stage coach stop in the mid-1800s and attracted tourists who visited nearby sulfur springs. Farmers and ranchers moved in and the area still remains heavily dependent on agriculture.

On Sunday night, townspeople and many mourners from outside the community gathered for a candlelight vigil.

Resident Courtney Lee, 25, sobbed as she said: “I just want to know why? How can someone just take a child’s life?”

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said at a news conference that police had yet to establish a motive. Small town America is not immune from mass shootings, he added.

“We all in here know what happened today and it is something we all say doesn’t happen in small communities. But we found out today it does,” Tackitt told reporters.

Em entrevista à rádio BandNews, Meirelles repetiu que está trabalhando, no momento, para fazer a economia brasileira ter recuperação sustentada e que a decisão sobre 2018 tem de ser tomada apenas no futuro.

O ministro voltou a falar sobre a entrevista que deu à revista Veja na última semana, explicando que a pergunta que causou polêmica foi se ele tinha consciência de que é presidenciável. E disse que tem “total consciência disso”, porque as pessoas o citam como tal.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

“Ce sera beaucoup plus clair et beaucoup plus simple”, a promis le directeur de la fidélisation du groupe franco-néerlandais, Frédéric Kahane, lors d‘une conférence de presse.

Pour un euro dépensé (hors taxes et frais), un passager recevra quatre miles s‘il est au niveau le plus bas du programme (Ivory), le gain passant à six miles pour le statut Silver, sept miles pour Gold et huit miles pour Platinum.

Les voyageurs acquerront désormais à chaque vol des “points d‘expérience” (XP en anglais), une expression tirée des jeux vidéo selon un barème établi non plus en fonction d‘un certain nombre de vols réalisés mais de la distance parcourue et de la classe occupée.

Les passagers des vols domestiques, en France ou dans un autre pays du monde, gagneront deux points d‘expérience, tandis que les voyageurs en première classe sur les vols long-courriers les plus lointains en récolteront 60, imitant les voies suivies récemment par British Airways et Delta.

Après la refonte du programme, Air France-KLM distribuera à peu près autant de miles qu‘aujourd‘hui, un volume que le groupe refuse de communiquer, disant seulement qu‘ils représentent environ 1.000-1.100 “billets-prime” par jour, soit l‘équivalent de trois long-courriers.

“Nous n’avons pas à ce stade fait évoluer les bénéfices” pour les membres de Flying Blue, a dit Frédéric Kahane.

Air France-KLM réalise actuellement près de 55% de son chiffre d‘affaires avec des clients fidélisés, pour l‘essentiel des membres du programme Flying Blue.

“C‘est cette partie-là qu’on a l’intention d’augmenter” de 10% à 15%, a expliqué Frédéric Kahane.

PAS QUESTION DE FILIALISER FLYING BLUE

Air France-KLM n‘a pas communiqué non plus d‘objectif chiffré en termes d‘augmentation du nombre de ses membres Flying Blue, qui sont actuellement 15 millions.

Flying Blue est actuellement une entité au sein d‘Air France-KLM et il n‘est pas prévu de la transformer en filiale, a précisé le PDG Jean-Marc Janaillac lors de la conférence de presse.

D‘autres compagnies ont suivi cette voie, avec plus ou moins de bonheur.

Air Berlin, qui a cessé ses activité en octobre, a vendu 70% de son programme de fidélité à son actionnaire majoritaire Etihad en 2012 pour 185 millions d‘euros, soit plus que la capitalisation boursière de la compagnie allemande à l‘époque.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUSKBN1D324K

Allowing Northern Ireland to retain some access has been floated by the European Parliament’s Brexit pointman, Guy Verhofstadt.

“We will leave the European Union in 2019 as one United Kingdom,” the British minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said on Monday. “We need to ensure that nothing is done that undermines the integrity of the UK single market.”

“I find it difficult to image how Northern Ireland could somehow remain in while the rest of the country leaves. I find it impossible,” he told a seminar in Brussels.

Brokenshire reiterated Prime Minister Theresa May’s insistence that the United Kingdom would be exiting both as a result of the 2016 referendum.

London has proposed an “invisible border” without border posts or immigration checks between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. But it has given no firm ideas on customs arrangements and the EU side has been mostly critical, saying these plans are unrealistic.

Dublin has said it will not let Brexit negotiations move from the divorce talks to discussions about future trade relations between Britain and the EU - as London is pushing for - without more guarantees on the border.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has demanded more guarantees that the Irish issue would be solved even if the future trade talks between Britain and the remaining 27 EU states collapse.

Brokenshire said some agricultural laws in Northern Ireland -- which is trying to reach agreement on how to relaunch its regional executive that is ruled at arm’s length from London -- were already different than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

He signaled Belfast could keep some of its laws closer to those of the EU after Brexit to minimize trade disruptions across the future border.

He also said London was keen to preserve the single electricity market on the island of Ireland and hoped for close cooperation with Dublin, including on security matters, after Britain leaves, as is now due to happen in March, 2019.

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUKKBN1D61ZN?il=0

“Essa comissão é para definir qual valor que cada um tem de pagar para o outro”, destacou ele a jornalistas no intervalo da 17ª Conferência Internacional Datagro sobre Açúcar e Etanol, em São Paulo.

A forma de pagamento também será discutida.

Assinado em 2010, o contrato de cessão onerosa deu à Petrobras o direito de produzir até 5 bilhões de barris em áreas do pré-sal.

A estatal pagou na época 42,5 bilhões de dólares ao governo federal pelo direito de explorar a região, mas estava prevista uma renegociação do contrato no futuro, após a declaração de comercialidade das áreas.

Nos últimos meses, a Petrobras vem cobrando da União uma revisão do contrato da cessão onerosa, com uma visão de que a companhia hoje seria credora do governo, devido à queda dos preços do petróleo desde o acordo original.

“Estamos avançando. O governo está criando uma comissão de negociação, a ser anunciada nos próximos dias, para formalizar instituições e pessoas que representarão o governo nessa negociação. A Petrobras também estará presente. Será um negócio formal e esperamos avançar, mas por enquanto não há nada resolvido”, comentou Félix.

O secretário salientou que um “entendimento” entre as partes é necessário até o fim do ano para que seja possível realizar um leilão das reservas excedentes, estimadas pela reguladora ANP na última sexta-feira em pelo menos 6 bilhões de barris de petróleo equivalente, volume contestado nesta segunda-feira pela estatal.

A estimativa é importante porque os volumes excedentes poderiam ser leiloados pelo governo no futuro ou mesmo serem usados como moeda de troca com a Petrobras, que argumenta ter direito de ser credora na renegociação do contrato da cessão onerosa.

RENOVABIO

Em relação ao programa RenovaBio, que visa expandir a produção de biocombustíveis no país, Félix se mostrou otimista quanto a um envio do texto ao Congresso Nacional ainda neste mês, seja como medida provisória (MP) ou projeto de lei (PL).

De acordo com ele, os “pontos questionados”, incluindo eventual impacto inflacionário do RenovaBio, “podem ser fechados em menos de 15 dias”, o que daria tempo para o governo apresentar o programa na COP-23, a conferência do clima, em Bonn, na Alemanha.

“No nosso entendimento, pelo Ministério de Minas e Energia, em menos de 15 dias estará pronto para a Casa Civil encaminhar o projeto de lei ou a medida provisória.”

Lançado em dezembro do ano passado, o RenovaBio é um programa do governo federal para expansão dos biocombustíveis no Brasil, incluindo metas de uso desses produtos e negociações de créditos de descarbonização (CBios), semelhante ao modelo utilizado nos Estados Unidos.

O programa foi à consulta pública no primeiro trimestre de 2017, teve suas diretrizes aprovadas pelo Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE) em junho e depois foi enviado à Casa Civil para formatação como MP ou PL, algo que ainda não ocorreu.",Governo trabalha em comissão de negociação sobre cessão onerosa com Petrobras,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1D623A-OBRBS

European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts.

Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries.

The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it.

Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package.

The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code.

Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business.

However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units.

Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs.

BLUNT INSTRUMENT

“Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.

“I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee.

Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes.

As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018.

European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young.

Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties.

“That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy.

He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.”

Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes.

The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law.

The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns.

The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week.

Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well.

There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.

It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said.

“You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?”

The court’s decision means Puigdemont, who left Spain last month after Madrid fired his secessionist government and dissolved the Catalan parliament, is free to campaign for independence in an election in the region on Dec 21.

Puigdemont said on Monday his government’s actions were legitimate and criticized the Spanish judicial system for a “clear lack of independence and neutrality”.

The December vote is shaping up to be a de facto independence referendum.

Puigdemont’s PDeCAT and another secessionist party said at the weekend they might run on a combined ticket, but would need to make a decision on any formal alliance - which might also include other parties - by a deadline of Tuesday.

Alliances could however also form after the election.

The independence push has dragged Spain into its worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. It has deeply divided the country, fuelling anti-Spanish feelings in Catalonia and nationalist tendencies elsewhere.

Puigdemont turned himself in to Belgian police on Sunday along with four of his ex-ministers, after Spain issued a European arrest warrant on charges of rebellion as well as misuse of public funds.

All five are barred from leaving Belgium without a judge’s consent.

They will appear before a Belgian court on Nov. 17 for a hearing to discuss the arrest warrant, prosecutors in Brussels said in a statement.

CALL FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION

Puigdemont, writing in Britain’s Guardian newspaper, called for scrutiny of the Spanish judicial system and said the crisis could be solved only with a political and not a judicial solution.

“Does anyone think that the sacked Catalan government can expect a fair and independent hearing, uninfluenced by political and media pressure? I do not,” he wrote.

Spain’s central government took control of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, after local leaders held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 despite a Constitutional Court ban.

The region’s parliament then passed a unilateral declaration of independence. In response, Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy fired the government and called the snap regional elections.

Eight of Puigdemont’s allies stayed behind in Spain and have been detained on similar accusations to the ones the deposed leader faces.

On Sunday, the first part of a GAD3 survey showed that pro-independence parties would win the election in Catalonia but may not gain the parliamentary majority needed to continue with secession.

On Monday, the second part showed just one in seven people in the region believe the current standoff between Barcelona and Madrid will end in independence, while more than two thirds think the process has been bad for the economy.

Published in La Vanguardia newspaper, that survey polled 1,233 people between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3.

Optimism that a negotiated solution would be found was low, with just over a fifth of respondents thinking the crisis would lead to talks between regional authorities and Madrid.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-offers-103-billion-for-qualcomm-sets-up-takeover-battle-idUSKBN1D61EO?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUKKBN1D620V?il=0

IHS Markit’s final composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone fell to 56.0 in October last month from September’s 56.7, pipping an earlier flash estimate of 55.9 and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.

Growth in Spain’s key services sector fell to its lowest in nine months as the political crisis in Catalonia weighed heavily on business sentiment.

New orders growth accelerated despite firms increasing their prices at the joint fastest rate since the middle of 2011. The output price index rose to a seven-month high of 53.1 from 52.7.

More expensive energy and intermediate goods pushed up euro zone prices at factory gates more than expected in September, data from the European Union’s statistics office showed on Monday.

“Some price rises merely reflect the pass-through of higher costs, but companies are also reporting stronger pricing power as demand conditions continue to improve, which suggests underlying inflationary pressures are becoming more engrained,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

Robust growth alongside increasing price pressures will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who last month took a step toward weaning the euro zone off loose money.

A PMI covering the bloc’s dominant service industry fell to 55.0 from 55.8, ahead of a preliminary reading of 54.9 and offsetting the strongest month in almost seven years for manufacturers.

然而，在钟摆的另一端，道琼斯旗下财经网站MarketWatch今年三月刊登了一篇题为Amazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did的文章，引用三位经济学家David Autor、David Dorn和Gordon Hanson去年发表的研究指出，中国廉价出口充斥美国市场，这些年来估计令美国损失多达二百万个职位。亚马逊未来五年若能在「一般商品、衣物及饰物、家具及其他销售」，即统计学家称为GAFO的零售环节拿下四成市场占有率，美国实体商品职位将流失一百五十万个；连同超市、药房、仓储及货运服务，因亚马逊无孔不入而损失的职位恐怕远超二百万，较中国出口对美国就业市场造成的打击更严重。

文章没有提及的是，贝索斯无时无刻不在自动化层面动脑筋，即使身为亚马逊员工，亦不意味就业便有保障。二○一二年，该公司斥资七亿七千五百万美元收购自动化系统发展商Kiva Systems，随即易名Amazon Robotics，大批「机械人」两年后于亚马逊的货仓和分发中心投入运作。该公司目前有超过十万台这样的机械人在全球各地执勤，贝索斯扬言日后引入更多「非人类员工」。

二百多个城市争着沾亚马逊的光，有多少人注意到，这家全球最大网上零售商每创造一个新职位，同时亦可能摧毁一个或更多的工作岗位？这正是贝索斯深具争议性的原因：亚马逊既是职位创造者，同时也令许多人饭碗不保；既为数以亿计消费者带来价廉物美的货品及前所未有的购物便利，同时亦把竞争对手赶尽杀绝，被颠覆的领域由实体商品、超市、餐饮，一直延伸至货运、物流，对各行各业的冲击陆续有来，跟公司强劲的销售增长势头恰成正比。

科技巨轮不可阻挡，随着电脑化及更具效率的生产模式兴起，过去一世纪遭淘汰的工种以至行业不计其数，但原职不保的受薪人士，大部分最终都能被就业市场再吸纳。本报「创科斗室」日前便有报导指出，美国最近一项调查发现，百分之五十七受访者相信自己及家人的工作未来十年内不虞被机械人抢走，当中不少人更预期，自动化有助提升工作效率，甚至加强职业安全。这个调查结果，跟打工仔在科网、人工智能（AI）时代人人自危的说法大相迳庭。

有趣的是，贝索斯曾在一个论坛上被问及对科技取代人手有何看法，这位全球首富的回应出人意表，既没有劝人不断增值，亦未全力鼓励受影响者设法转型，反而建议政府考虑推出全民基本收入（universal basic income），变相赞同无法适应职场新环境之辈摊大手板向政府领讨生活费。

到底是贝索斯「高瞻远瞩」洞悉未来，抑或上述调查的受访者乐观得有理，今后十年肯定将成为世界各地「热爆」的社会及政治议题！ （完）

Temperatures this year would be slightly less than during a record-breaking 2016 and roughly level with 2015, as part of a long-term warming trend driven by greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said.

“We have witnessed extraordinary weather,” said Petteri Talaas, head of the WMO, pointing to extreme events including a spate of hurricanes in the Atlantic and Caribbean, monsoon floods in Asia and drought in East Africa.

He said the dip from last year was largely because a natural El Nino event that released extra heat from the Pacific Ocean in 2016 had faded.

Delegates said sweltering temperatures and weather extremes were a spur for action at the annual conference in Bonn from Nov. 6-17, which will to work on a detailed rule book for the 2015 Paris climate agreement and try to step up action before 2020.

“This is our moment of truth,” Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, presiding at the Bonn talks, told delegates, urging them to “lock arms with all other nations and move forward together.”

“Millions of people around the world have suffered and continue to suffer from extreme weather events,” said Patricia Espinosa, the U.N.’s climate chief. “The message cannot get any clearer. We must act right here, right now.”

U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts mainstream scientific findings that man-made greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate change, said in June he would pull out of the Paris agreement and instead promote U.S. fossil fuels.

Schleswig-Holsteins Ministerpräsident Daniel Günther (CDU) mahnte am Montag auch die Union, auf Forderungen von Grünen und FDP einzugehen. Trotz der vor allem von der FDP forcierten Neuwahl-Debatte rechnen 64 Prozent der Bundesbürger laut einer Forsa-Umfrage aber mit der Bildung einer Jamaika-Regierung aus CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen.

Für den Abend war geplant, dass die Vorsitzenden und Spitzenunterhändler der Parteien die Linien für die zweite Sondierungsrunde abstecken. Am Wochenende sollten alle vier Parteien über die großen Linien sprechen und entscheiden, in welchen Bereichen nun in den kommenden beiden Wochen Einigungen erzielt werden müssen. Günther forderte dabei eine Konzentration auf wesentliche Punkte. “Denn für die Sondierungsverhandlungen ist es am Ende nicht wichtig, dass jeder Detailpunkt geklärt ist”, sagte er vor der CDU-Präsidiumssitzung. Wenn man sich auf das Wesentliche konzentriere, “dann reichen diese zwei Wochen, die wir jetzt noch haben, bequem aus, um noch zu einem erfolgreichen Abschluss zu kommen”. Ein Abschluss der Sondierungen ist für den 16. November angepeilt. Günther forderte von der Union Kompromissbereitschaft beim Familiennachzug, von den Grünen dagegen beim Klimaschutz. Auch CDU-Vize Julia Klöckner appellierte an die Kompromissbereitschaft aller Seiten.

FDP-GENERALSEKRETÄRIN: STREBEN KEINE NEUWAHL AN

FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer sagte, sie sei optimistisch, dass der Zeitplan bis zum 16. November gehalten werden könne. Die FDP strebe keine Neuwahl an. Wenn die FDP sich aber entscheiden müsse, ob sie ihre Glaubwürdigkeit an der Garderobenstange abgebe oder ob es Wahlen gebe, “dann entscheiden wir uns eben im Zweifel für Neuwahlen”. Die Grünen-Chefunterhändlerin Katrin Göring-Eckardt rechnet in dieser Woche nicht mit einem Durchbruch in der Frage, ob eine Jamaika-Koalition möglich ist

Am Wochenende hatte FDP-Chef Christian Lindner erneut die Neuwahl-Debatte im Falle eines Scheitern der Jamaika-Gespräche betont. “Neuwahlen wären eine Katastrophe und sind für mich keine Option”, sagte dagegen Ministerpräsident Günther in der “Bild”-Zeitung. Überschattet werden die Gespräche auch vom CSU-internen Machtkampf und von Rückzugsforderungen der Jungen Union Bayerns an CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer, der in Berlin die Verhandlungen für seine Partei führt. Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann (CSU) rief die Seehofer-Kritiker auf, sich bis zur Klärung der Jamaika-Koalitionsfrage zurückzuhalten. “Das ist in der Tat nicht hilfreich, was da geschieht”, sagte der CSU-Politiker im ZDF-Morgenmagazin.

In dieser Woche wollen die Jamaika-Sondierer nach der Steuerschätzung auch den finanzielle Spielraum für Reformen klären. Das Bundesfinanzministerium sieht nach einem Zeitungsbericht in der nächsten Steuerschätzung nur einen begrenzten zusätzlichen Finanzspielraum für neue Vorhaben der nächsten Bundesregierung. Das “Handelsblatt” berichtete unter Berufung auf mehrere Insider, die Vorlage des Ministeriums für die am Dienstag beginnende Runde der amtlichen Steuerschätzer sehe für die Jahre 2018 bis 2021 insgesamt 16 Milliarden Euro mehr an Steuereinnahmen für den Bund vor als bisher erwartet wurden. Damit bliebe der gesamte zusätzliche finanzielle Spielraum für die nächsten vier Jahre, der etwa für Steuererleichterungen oder neue ausgabenwirksame Programme genutzt werden könnte, im Rahmen der 30 Milliarden Euro, die bereits in einem Papier aus dem Finanzministerium genannt worden waren.

Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam, and four men who are still at large, have been charged in the murder of the half-brother of the country’s leader, using banned chemical weapon VX at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers have said Siti Aisyah and Huong were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality TV show.

The four suspects, who were caught on airport camera talking to the women before they attacked Kim Jong Nam, were identified as North Koreans for the first time on Monday, a month since the trial began.

Three of them were seen meeting a North Korean embassy official and the Air Koryo official, both unidentified, at the main airport terminal within an hour of the attack, lead police investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz told the court.

North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said.

Footage played in the courtroom showed the Air Koryo official helping the three suspects at an airport check-in counter. He was later seen arranging a flight ticket for the fourth suspect too, Wan Azirul said.

Wan Azirul identified the men as North Koreans Hong Song Hac, Ri Ji Hyon, Ri Jae Nam and O Jong Gil, citing intelligence findings by the special branch of the Malaysian police.

Wan Azirul said he investigated and took statements from both the embassy and the Air Koryo official.

“They explained that the reason they were there was to assist every North Korean individual or citizen who boarded a flight to leave the country,” he told the court.

The North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not respond to Reuters’ telephone calls and emails to seek comment.

The sensational murder unraveled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea.

Malaysia was forced to return Kim Jong Nam’s body and allow the return home of three North Korean men wanted for questioning and hiding in the Kuala Lumpur embassy, in exchange for the release of nine Malaysians stuck in Pyongyang.

Wan Azirul said police intelligence also provided information on a fifth suspect identified as Ri Ji U, who was also “suspected to have the real name James”, based on images and photographs taken from Siti Aisyah’s phone.

He's faces an arrest warrant by Spain for rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to the Catalan independence campaign.

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUKKBN1D620V

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite.

Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

Kim has traded insults and nuclear threats with U.S. President Donald Trump for months, raising concerns that the Games, due to be held at an alpine resort 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most heavily fortified border, could be marred by political tensions, or worse.

Economic sanctions on the reclusive nation are mounting but the sporting world and South Korea are doing everything in their power to try to coax Pyongyang to accept an invitation to the Games and relieve geopolitical tensions that have hurt ticket sales.

“We are doing our utmost for the North’s participation,” said Song Ki-hun, a lawmaker with South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s party. “But Kim Jong Un is very unpredictable,” added Song. He is based near the Games venue and sits on a special parliamentary committee to support the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Kim, a basketball fan who counts former NBA star Dennis Rodman as a friend, has boosted spending on sports as part of his ambition to turn the North into a ""sports power.""

If the North joins the Games, it would mark the first time in post-war Olympic history that a country has hosted a team from a nation with which it is officially at war. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

The last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, the 1988 summer Games in Seoul, North Korea’s founding father, Kim Il Sung, boycotted them after a plan to co-host them fell apart.

“With North Korea there, things will be smoother,” said a European official from a winter sports federation, asking not to be identified because of the political sensitivity of the subject. “The Games will only be really successful if they are smooth. If the United States, North Korea and China all have their teams in South Korea then that will be a success.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the prospect of U.S. athletes competing with North Korea, a country Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” if provoked.

North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and South Korea to join the Games. But Games officials have said the North could wait until shortly before the Games to say whether it will join.

The IOC said its help so far has mainly been with travel and competition costs, and it will consider wild-card entries for those who do not meet qualification standards.

Seoul has said it is even open to forming a unified North-South ice hockey team. Pyongyang’s IOC representative dismissed that idea in a recent media interview, but a South Korean culture ministry official said Seoul had not abandoned it.

Seoul’s other gestures include a rare proposal for North Korean athletes to enter the South by walking across the border at Panmunjom, the tense and heavily guarded “truce village” where the 1953 armistice was signed.

GOING FOR GLORY

Kim Jong Un, grandson of founder Kim Il Sung, has made sport a major focus of his plan to improve living standards. Since he assumed power in 2011, spending on sport in the nation’s annual budgets has risen faster than most other areas, according to state media reports.

The reports, which only give percentage data, include a record 17 percent jump in funding in 2014 when Kim set out his ambition for sports in an open letter to his Workers’ Party.

He urged the party and athletes to help make sport part of daily life and uphold “the party’s plan of building our country into a sports power, sweat more in training in order to bring glory to the country by winning gold medals.”

He also had school textbooks revised to say that he began shooting a gun at age 3, was off-road driving before turning 8, and had twice beaten foreign master mariners in ship races, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, the think tank of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service in Seoul. Reuters could not verify that report.

Simon Cockerell, head of Beijing-based Koryo Tours, which has brought competitors to the North for events ranging from the Pyongyang Marathon to Frisbee-throwing and cricket, said he had noticed an increasing focus on sports under Kim.

“More events seem to be happening, DPRK sports teams are traveling more than ever, and success is celebrated more than before,” said Cockerell, using the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

At the 2014 Asian Games in South Korea, North Korea’s athletes won 11 gold medals, ranking sixth, and were welcomed with a victory parade and a banquet with Kim who thanked them for validating the “party’s plan for building a sports powerhouse.”

The North is developing sports grounds and arenas, according to Curtis Melvin, of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, where satellite imagery is used to map the North’s economic development.

“Satellite imagery shows lots of park renovation and construction of skate and sports parks, even in very remote areas,” Melvin said.

Kim Jong Un, who studied in the Swiss capital Bern and according to former classmates went on school ski trips in the Alps, has already built a ski resort.

HOCKEY STICKS

So far, only two North Korean athletes have qualified for the Games: figure-skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, whose routines have been set to music by The Beatles and Ginette Reno’s “Je ne suis qu‘une chanson.”

An IOC official said others could qualify for cross-country skiing, and possibly speed skating and biathlon, a combination of skiing and shooting.

Even if they do not, Games organizing committee chief Lee Hee-beom told Reuters athletes may be invited to compete - a common Olympics practice to encourage participation by underdogs, for instance athletes from a tropical country in a winter sport. One famous example brought a Jamaican bobsleigh team to Calgary in 1988. That inspired a movie based on their exploits.

An extra problem for North Korea could be sanctions. In March last year, the U.N. Security Council added “recreational sports equipment” to a list of luxury goods banned from export to the state. North Korea’s National Sports Guidance Committee has accused Washington of using the United Nations to stretch “its tentacles deep into the area of sports.”

When the North Korean ice hockey team arrived in New Zealand last April for the World Championships, the sport’s international body arranged to equip them with 50 new sticks which it would be impossible to export to the North, a New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation official said.

The team handed back the sticks at the airport on their way home, a New Zealand Customs Service spokeswoman said.",Kim Jong Un's love of sport could be making of Games,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1D612K-OCASP

The move, on the eve of a visit to Washington by Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, came almost a month after U.S. missions in Turkey suspended all non-immigrant visa services following Turkey’s arrest of a U.S. consulate employee.

Within hours of the U.S. announcement on Oct. 8, Turkey said it was implementing reciprocal measures and President Tayyip Erdogan later angrily accused Washington of sacrificing a longstanding alliance with Ankara.

“The U.S. Mission in Turkey has resumed processing visas on a limited basis,” the embassy said in an email seen by Reuters on Monday, adding that appointments would be limited and could lead to long waiting times.

A U.S. embassy worker in Ankara confirmed the decision to Reuters. The lira firmed to 3.8356 at 1533 GMT, from 3.8708 beforehand.

“The decision came right before PM Yildirim’s visit to the U.S., showing that Turkey-US agreed on a mutual solution regarding the visa service crisis,” Ozgur Altug, chief economist at brokerage BGC Partners, said in a note.

The gains in the lira, which was also boosted by central bank measures on dollar liquidity earlier on Monday, helped push Istanbul's main BIST stock index .XU100 up 2.58 percent on Monday to close at a record high of 114.165,67 points.

In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and, more recently, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year’ failed coup. The U.S. Embassy has said the accusations are baseless.

Turkish police want to question a third worker based in Istanbul. His wife and daughter were detained over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the abortive putsch. They were later released.

Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition.

Gulen denies any involvement in the failed coup.

With only 17 months left until Britain is due to exit the European Union, the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears among executives of an abrupt departure with no transition.

Monday’s survey raised the prospect of disruption for British manufacturers with EU clients.

On Sunday, the Confederation of British Industry said almost two in three British firms will have implemented Brexit contingency plans by March if Britain and the rest of the EU have not struck a transitional deal by then.

Britain and the EU said last week they were ready to speed up talks, but CIPS said it was already too late for scores of businesses that look likely to be dropped by European customers.

“British businesses simply cannot put their suppliers and customers on hold while the negotiators get their act together,” said Gerry Walsh, CIPS’ group chief executive officer.

“The lack of clarity coming from both sides is already shaping the British economy of the future - and it does not fill businesses with confidence.”

British finance minister Philip Hammond said last month that a transition deal needed to be struck by early 2018.

CIPS said a fifth of British businesses were struggling to secure contracts that extend beyond March 2019, the date Britain is due to leave the EU.

Its survey also added to signs that the pound’s plunge after last year’s Brexit vote did more harm than good to Britain’s economy. Nearly two-thirds of firms said the fluctuations had raised the cost of managing their supply chains.

Hammond is under pressure to help British businesses as he readies his Nov. 22 annual budget.

Manufacturing association EEF urged him to take measures that will boost Britain’s patchy investment performance.

“The chancellor has to offset acute anxiety among companies over Brexit with a budget that reassures business the government will deliver a comprehensive and ambitious industrial strategy,” said EEF chief executive Terry Scuoler.

EEF recommended that Hammond should boost capital allowances and tax credits for research and design in British companies.

Having already bought 2.2 trillion euros worth of bonds to depress borrowing costs, the ECB has started to shift its focus from new purchases, arguing that its bloated balance sheet will provide the bulk of accommodation needed to lift inflation.

New buys will be cut in half to 30 billion euros a month from January and markets expect the ECB to end purchases by the end of the year. One reason is that finding enough bonds is becoming increasingly difficult within the legal parameters of the program, commonly known as quantitative easing.

October data released on Monday showed that purchases remained skewed towards countries such as France and Italy, with the ECB deviating from the so-called capital key, a rule that requires purchases in line with the size of each country’s economy.

Bond buys in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, were about 300 million euros below the capital key. They also trailed in Portugal and dropped to zero in Ireland, where the ECB already has sizable bond holdings.

The ECB’s problem is that it cannot hold more than a third of each country’s debt, so once it reaches a the limit, it needs to redistribute purchases among countries with bigger bond markets, facing accusations that it is de facto rewarding more indebted countries.

SMALLER THAN EXPECTED

Redemptions, disclosed for the first time on Monday, will average 10.8 billion euros a month in the 12 months from November, below analyst expectations for around 15 billion euros, with big fluctuations expected between months, the data released for the first time showed.

Redemptions will peak in April, when they hit 24.3 billion euros. The lowest monthly total will be in August, when they drop to 2 billion euros, the figures showed.

The vast majority of redemptions -- 101.5 billion euros -- will be in the public-sector purchase program, which is dominated by government bonds. Eighteen billion euros worth of covered bonds and seven billion euros of asset-backed securities are also due to mature.

Cash maturing from government bonds will be reinvested within two months in the same country as the original bond, if market conditions allow, the ECB said earlier. The re-investments are due to continue for an extended period after new buys end.

Ross was responding in media interviews to reports on Sunday about his investments stemming from the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investment that relate to the affairs of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“There is nothing wrong with anything that was done,” Ross told CNBC, adding that he had not considered resigning following Sunday’s report. Ross is a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which the New York Times said earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for Russian petrochemical firm Sibur.

The Times, which based its report on files from prominent offshore law firm Appleby, said Sibur stakeholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and Putin associate who is subject to U.S. sanctions, and Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.

Navigator was mentioned in Ross’s 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. The Times said the latest batch of documents provided more insight into his financial holdings.

Reuters was not able to confirm the Times’ findings.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest such holdings.

The investments raised questions about whose interests Ross represents, Blumenthal said, calling for an inspector general probe by the department as well as congressional hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC in an interview.

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

SANCTIONS

In an earlier statement, a Department of Commerce spokesman said Ross “was not involved in Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur ... has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship”.

He added that Sibur had not been under sanctions when Navigator began its relationship with the publicly-traded firm and still was not.

“A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period. It was a normal commercial relationship and one that I had nothing to do with the creation of, and do not know the shareholders who were apparently sanctioned at some later point in time,” Ross told CNBC.

In a statement, Sibur said it had no direct dealings with Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.

Neither Navigator nor Appleby were available for comment on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Timchenko declined to comment, while Shamalov did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

In its report, the Times said Ross had kept the investment in Navigator, which increased its business dealings with Sibur, including chartering ships, even as Western nations sought to punish Russia’s energy sector over Putin’s incursions into Ukraine.

“The Secretary recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,” the Commerce Department spokesman said, adding that Ross maintains the “highest ethical standards.”

Separately, the Times cited Appleby’s files in another report that said hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin were behind Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner’s investments in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

QUEEN‘S TAXES

Citing the Appleby documents, Britain’s Guardian newspaper said millions of pounds from Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, had been invested in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio never before disclosed.

Reuters could not independently confirm the Guardian report.

The newspaper said the Duchy had used offshore private equity funds designed to shield investors in the United Kingdom from having to pay U.S. tax on their holdings.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.”

The spokeswoman also said the Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income received from the Duchy.

Citing the documents, Guardian also reported that international trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) had “secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars” to Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a mining deal in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The British newspaper said Gertler had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters was not immediately able to contact him.

Glencore said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, but dated Oct. 27 and addressed to the ICIJ, that it had made a loan to a company affiliated to Gertler in 2009 on commercial terms and that it was fully repaid.

“In February 2009, Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd made a loan to Lora Enterprises Limited (Lora), an entity affiliated with Mr Gertler,” the company said.

“The loan to Lora was made on commercial terms negotiated at arm’s length,” it said. “The loan was fully repaid by Lora in 2010.”",U.S. commerce chief Ross: Nothing improper about his Russia-tied investments,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D6003

Selection of jurors is scheduled to begin before U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn. On trial Manuel Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation; José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s soccer federation; and Juan Ángel Napout, formerly president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and of Paraguay’s soccer federation.

U.S. prosecutors have accused the three of taking bribes and kickbacks in connection with the sale of media and marketing rights to Copa America and Copa Libertadores tournaments, international competitions organized by CONMEBOL.

The trial is part of a sweeping criminal probe in which U.S. prosecutors have charged 42 people and entities. Prosecutors have described a widespread culture of corruption around the awarding of media and marketing rights to soccer games throughout the world. Burga, Marin and Napout are the first of the people charged to go to trial.

Twenty-four people have pleaded guilty, most of them since the probe was announced in May 2015, though the first pleas came in 2013. The charges against one of those people, U.S. soccer official Charles Blazer, were voided after his death in July.

“After waiting two years, Mr. Napout looks forward to his day in court,” Napout’s lawyer, Silvia Pinera-Vazquez, said on Friday.

Charles Stillman, a lawyer for Marin, and Bruce Udolf, a lawyer for Burga, declined to comment.

Among the defendants who have pleaded guilty in the case are Jeffrey Webb, a former FIFA vice president and president of CONCACAF, the governing body for soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean; and José Hawilla, accused of paying bribes to secure contracts for his sports marketing company, Traffic Group.

In October, Costas Takkas, described by prosecutors as Webb’s attache, was sentenced to 15 months in prison and Hector Trujillo, a former secretary general of the Guatemalan soccer federation, was sentenced to eight months.

Other defendants have not been extradited to the United States.

Sepp Blatter, who served as FIFA’s president from 1998 until he was suspended in late 2015, was not charged in the case.

There were conflicting reports of the casualty numbers in Friday’s incident in the district of Chahardara outside Kunduz. A local council member said 13 people were killed, but a spokesman for the provincial governor said it was just one.

However, the incident underlines the risk of increased civilian casualties from the recent U.S. decision to step up air strikes and special forces operations in Afghanistan to break a stalemate with Taliban militants.

“There is a need for a proper investigation to prove these allegations and we will launch it soon,” Ghulam Qader Akbari, the governor of Chahardara, said on Monday.

On Saturday, the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Kabul confirmed the incident had occurred in Kunduz and said an investigation had begun, but gave no details.

“We are aware of allegations regarding the potential for civilian casualties as the result of a combined operation in northern Afghanistan,” Resolute Support spokesman Capt Tom Gresback said in a statement.

“Resolute Support takes all allegations of civilian casualties and the responsibility of human life seriously, and is assessing the facts surrounding this incident.”

Khosh Bawar Nasratyar, a member of the local provincial council, said 13 people had been killed by U.S. airstrikes in the district.

But Nematullah Temor, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said only one civilian had been killed and six wounded when coalition forces hit a car taking people to the villages of Ghar O Qeshlaq and Qatl-e-Am to evacuate Taliban casualties.

He said other reports of civilian casualties were “untrue and baseless”.

Afghan Special Forces said 48 insurgents had been killed in Chahardara but denied any civilian casualties, saying the area had been evacuated before the operation.

But graphic pictures purporting to show the aftermath of the incident, and unconfirmed reports that as many as 60 people had been killed, were widely shared on social media, highlighting the risk that public opinion could turn decisively against the government over the issue.

The most recent United Nations civilian casualty figures, released last month, show air strikes drove a rise of 52 percent in the first nine months of 2017, to 205 killed and 261 injured, versus the corresponding period last year.

Ronaldo is used to having an annual joust with Messi for the “Pichichi” prize for La Liga’s top scorer but has only netted once this season and was wasteful in Real Madrid’s 3-0 win over Las Palmas on Sunday.

Barcelona’s Suarez, top scorer two seasons ago, extended his run without a goal to five games in all competitions following a lifeless display in the 2-1 win over Sevilla on Saturday as Paco Alcacer scored twice to keep Barca four points clear at the top.

Griezmann, third in the Ballon d‘Or last year, has only scored twice and had to face the ignominy of being substituted for defender Jose Gimenez while Atletico Madrid were being held to a goalless draw by Deportivo La Coruna, watching on as his side stole a 1-0 win in stoppage-time.

Messi did not find the net either but the Argentine remains top of the scoring charts with 11 goals in 11 games.

Below him are unfamiliar names.

Valencia’s Simone Zaza is second with nine, Villarreal’s Cedric Bakambu is on eight and Valencia’s Rodrigo Moreno and 21-year-old Antonio Sanabria of Real Betis have seven.

Suarez is 22nd, Griezmann 37th and Ronaldo down at 70th. Ronaldo’s strike partner Karim Benzema has only scored two goals all season.

NO CELEBRATION

Ronaldo did provide the cross for Isco to score Real’s third goal on Sunday but the assist could not lighten his mood and he looked thoroughly miserable as he neglected to join his team mates in celebration.

“Cristiano goes home upset when he doesn’t score, but he makes a difference,” Madrid captain Sergio Ramos said in defence of his goal-starved team mate.

“Cristiano and Karim will score goals soon enough. We don’t worry if they’ve only scored a few goals because they both make a difference and what matters is winning.”

Atletico coach Diego Simeone avoided questions about Griezmann’s dip, saying it was positive that his side have taken 23 points during the striker’s drought.

Barca coach Ernesto Valverde continued to back Suarez, repeating his message that he would be more concerned if the Uruguayan had not created chances. Suarez had only two efforts on goal against Sevilla.

Suarez still appears to be struggling with a knee injury he suffered at the start of the season and which he rushed back from to help Uruguay qualify for the World Cup.

He should benefit from being rested for this month’s friendlies against Poland and Austria, although he may also be suffering due to a change in Barca’s system since Neymar left and Ousmane Dembele got injured.

“Luis Suarez remains Valverde’s biggest challenge. An urgent solution is needed,” wrote Ernest Folch, the editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport on Sunday.

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

An autopsy will determine the cause of death, Martin said.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said in an interview that the family members had not been present at the time of Kelley’s attack

“I heard that (the in-laws) attended church from time to time,” Tackitt said. “Not on a regular basis.”

The attack, which killed people ranging from 18 months to 77 years old, came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest by a single gunman in the United States.

Officials warned that 10 of the wounded remained in critical condition on Monday morning.","Texas church gunman sent threatening texts to in-laws, officials say",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-texas-shooting/texas-gunmans-in-laws-sometimes-attended-church-sheriff-says-idUKKBN1D510H?il=0

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on.

Richard Berner, director of the Office of Financial Research, will be leaving that agency on Dec. 31, the Treasury Department announced on Monday. Berner helped create the agency as a Treasury official under President Barack Obama, and has led it since its creation in 2013.

The Treasury did not say who would replace Berner, but his exit gives President Donald Trump another opportunity to shift government watchdogs in a more industry-friendly direction.

Berner helped establish the agency as a Treasury Department official before becoming its first and only director. He is leaving roughly one year before his current term expires in January 2019.

A full-time replacement would need to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.

The agency, created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, was charged to gather data and analyze trends across financial markets, in an effort to help sniff out looming threats before they threaten the economy. Housed within the Treasury Department, it lends its expertise to regulators charged with guarding against such sweeping risks.

But the agency has come under pressure from Republicans, who have argued it is redundant and should not be allowed to compel financial institutions to hand over data for analysis. A sweeping rewrite of financial rules passed by the House earlier would have eliminated the agency, but it is not expected to pass the Senate and become law.

And the Trump administration proposed in May slashing its budget by 25 percent and urging a “staffing streamlining...for maximum efficiency.”

Before Berner’s exit, existing openings across financial regulators already lingered. The Senate has been slow to advance, and Trump slow to nominate, new officials to fill some roles occupied by Obama officials, suggesting it could be some time before a new full-time OFR chief is in place.

Prior to joining the Obama administration, Berner had spent several years as a Wall Street economist, working as the co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, and chief economist at Mellon Bank. He previously worked on the research staff at the Federal Reserve.",Head of U.S. government financial agency to resign,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-risk/head-of-u-s-government-financial-agency-to-resign-idINKBN1D624T?il=0

BOSTON (Reuters) - Companies may have new grounds to keep shareholder proposals on social or ethical matters from coming to a vote at their annual meetings under guidance published late on Wednesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

According to the report, known as a “staff legal bulletin” and posted on the agency’s website, the SEC will take new account of a proposal’s “economic relevance” and its significance when companies ask for permission to skip votes on measures affecting less than five percent of their assets, earnings or sales.

Proponents could still argue their resolutions are significantly related to a company’s business, the paper states. But shareholder activists focused on social matters worry the new guidance could give companies more room to avoid proposals such as on opioid controls at drug companies, where the drugs make up just a small fraction of a company’s revenue.

“Clearly it will put new burdens of proof on investor proponents,” Tim Smith of Walden Asset Management, a frequent filer of social, governance and climate-related resolutions, said via e-mail.

Once seen as a distraction, proposals dealing with topics like climate change or gender diversity have gained a higher profile in recent years as they have drawn more backing from big asset managers. At the same time business groups lately have sought to restrict the proposals they say are often irrelevant, such as by raising the amount of shares needed to file them.

SEC officials said the new guidance was not meant to tilt the scales. The report states that companies looking for SEC permission to skip votes should offer a board analysis of a proposal’s significance to the company, which could give activists their say with directors.

“We did not set out to try to make things easier or harder for one side or the other, we were trying to improve the process,” said Bill Hinman, director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance.

The paper also specifies that SEC staff will still view most shareholder proposals on corporate governance topics as being significant and thus likely eligible for a company’s proxy.

Gunman Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs carrying an assault rifle and wearing black tactical gear, then opened fire during a Sunday prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, at least one of whom was armed, chased him in their vehicles and exchanged gunfire, and Kelley crashed his car and shot himself to death, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt told CBS News in an interview on Monday morning.

“At this time we believe that he had a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” Tackitt said. He later told CNN, “We know that his ex in-laws or in-laws came to church here from time to time ... They were not here (Sunday).”

The attack came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the number of dead in the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest in the United States.

Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott told CBS there was evidence that Kelley had mental health problems and that he had been denied a Texas gun permit.

“It’s clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off,” Abbott said.

Abbott and other Republican leaders were quick to say that the attack did not influence their support of gun ownership by U.S. citizens - the right to bear arms protected under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

“This isn’t a guns situation. I mean we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon to go into it,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters while on trip to Asia. “But fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise ... it would have been much worse. But this is a mental health problem at the highest level.”

Democrats renewed their call to restrict gun ownership following the attack.

“How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country’s gun policies,” Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter.

The victims in Sutherland Springs, a community of fewer than 400 people, located about 40 miles (65 km) east of San Antonio, included the 14-year-old daughter of church pastor Frank Pomeroy, the family told several television stations.

One couple, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, told the Washington Post they lost eight extended family members, including a pregnant granddaughter-in-law and three of her children.

In rural areas like Sutherland Springs, gun ownership is a part of life and the state’s Republican leaders for years have balked at gun control, arguing that more firearms among responsible owners make the state safer.

At the suspect’s home located in an isolated area of New Braunfels, about 35 miles (56 km) north of Sutherland Springs, a Comal County Sheriff vehicle blocked the entrance. A “beware of dog” sign was affixed to the gate where a dented mailbox bears the address.

Kelley served in its Logistics Readiness unit at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, according to the U.S. Air Force.

Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child, and given a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 12 months and a reduction in rank, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said.

Kelley’s Facebook page has been deleted, but cached photos show a profile picture where he appeared with two small children. He also posted a photo of what appeared to be an assault rifle, writing a post that read: “She’s a bad bitch.”","Texas gunman attacked church where in-laws worshipped, sheriff says",https://in.reuters.com/article/texas-shooting/texas-gunman-attacked-church-where-in-laws-worshipped-sheriff-says-idINKBN1D606C

India has committed $500 million to the Chabahar port that it is building as a way to bypass rival Pakistan and crack open a trade and transport route to landlocked Afghanistan, as well as the resource-rich countries of central Asia.

New Delhi plans to send seven shipments of wheat to Afghanistan through Chabahar by the end of January. A first shipment arrived last week from India’s western Kandla port, after years of political wrangling with Pakistan, government officials in New Delhi and Kabul said. The wheat will be trucked from Chabahar to western Afghanistan.

India is expanding its economic diplomacy in Afghanistan, seeing itself as a regional power. But Pakistan says India is trying to use Afghanistan as a base to destabilise Pakistan, and has long blocked India from conducting bilateral trade with Afghanistan using its territory as transit.

The shipments are meant to demonstrate the route’s viability, officials said, and the plan is to broaden the cargo flow before the port is fully operational by the end of next year.

“Things are moving quite well and as planned,” Saurabh Kumar, Indian ambassador to Iran, said in an email.

So far, the United States, keen for India to do more to help stabilise Afghanistan through economic and security assistance, has held off public criticism of renewed Indian efforts to develop the Iranian corridor.

India’s ties with Iran came up during U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s talks in New Delhi last month, and the top U.S. diplomat said America would not stand in the way of projects that help the Iranian people.

But he warned that the administration would crack down on financial benefits accruing to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the country’s most powerful security entity, blamed for fuelling regional proxy wars.

GATEWAY

India has framed its involvement in Chabahar’s development as primarily about establishing a gateway to Afghanistan, more than Iran itself, Indian officials and a Western diplomatic source said.

Washington has not intervened directly in the port’s development, but, previously, India drastically cut back its oil imports from Iran, one of its main suppliers, in the face of international sanctions on Tehran for its suspected nuclear programme.

“In general, I get the impression that conservative analysts in (Washington) DC have accepted the fact that India will maintain some form of relationship with Iran,” said Jeff Smith, a south Asia expert at The Heritage Foundation in Washington.

“They recognize that for India, Iran is more about a transport corridor to Afghanistan; that it has no interest in advancing Iran’s agenda in the Middle East; and that whatever space India evacuates there will be filled by China.”

An Indian government source said India Global Ports Ltd (IGPL), a company set up by the government to lead the Chabahar project, had held talks with Iranian authorities to begin interim operations.

In August, IGPL applied for permission to establish a company to run the port, the source said. The plan is for IGPL to build two new terminals, one for container vessels and one for multipurpose ships.

After some delay, IGPL awarded contracts last month for port construction equipment such as cranes, the source said. Iran, meanwhile, had completed the construction of a jetty.

“We are moving slowly, but there is movement on the port development despite U.S.-Iran relations deteriorating,” said Meena Singh Roy, an expert on India-Iran ties at the government-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.","India cracks open Iran sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing rival",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-iran-port/india-cracks-open-iran-sea-route-to-afghanistan-bypassing-rival-idINKBN1D61W2

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank is trying to lure more rich customers by helping them fund their businesses and lifestyles, with shipping, aviation and real estate loans a central focus.

The company has moved lending in those areas from its corporate bank to its wealth management unit, or private bank, over the past two years; the switch is one way in which Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam aims to deliver on his overarching strategy of driving group growth by expanding wealth management.

It is also one reason why Credit Suisse’s private bank is growing faster than that of its Swiss rival UBS (UBSG.S), the world’s largest wealth manager, in terms of revenue and attracting new money.

Moving the financing from its corporate to private bank means that, in those sectors, Credit Suisse will now be primarily lending to affluent individuals - clients whose personal wealth it helps manage.

But there are risks with such exposure. Shipping finance in particular can be a perilous proposition due to doubts over the current profitability of many companies in the industry and whether lenders can make sufficient returns on investments.

Credit Suisse - bucking a trend of banks retreating from shipping - believes it can reduce its vulnerability by lending to the high-net worth individuals who control firms, often millionaire or billionaire tycoons, according to finance experts.

The tactic nevertheless represents a calculated gamble, they said, because these people’s personal wealth are often linked to the fortunes of the industry.

“From the bank’s point of view, the deposits and private wealth product is the juice; the value to the bank has to be strong enough in order to consider making risky loans,” said Basil Karatzas of New York based shipping finance advisory firm Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co.

Credit Suisse declined to give details about its loan exposure in shipping, aviation and property, but finance sources estimated Credit Suisse’s exposure in shipping alone was at least $12 billion (£9.1 billion). Credit Suisse’s total net private banking loans totalled about 110 billion Swiss francs (£83.8 billion) at the end of the third quarter.

The bank declined to comment on the shipping loans figure.

Asked about the financing switch to the private bank and the associated risks, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said such lending was part of its overall wealth platform and that the bank considers “franchise value when engaging holistically with wealth management clients”.

A source familiar with the matter said Credit Suisse had not seen any significant losses on shipping loans and that such lending gave it a foot in the door to bank for wealthy families, which run major shipping companies.

SHIPPING MAGNATES

Many banks, facing capital pressure from regulators, are retreating from shipping because of the risks associated with a sector that has struggled with a near decade-long slump caused by too many vessels ordered and weaker demand.

FILE PHOTO: Visitors stand next to an aircraft at the The Jet Business booth during the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) at Cointrin airport in Geneva, Switzerland May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo

Lloyds (LLOY.L) became one of the first lenders to pull out of shipping finance, while fellow British bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) is in the process of exiting. Others such as Germany’s Commerzbank CGKG.DE and Bank of Ireland (BIRG.I) are winding down their remaining exposures. Finance sources estimate the sector has a capital shortfall of $30 billion this year.

Finance experts say Credit Suisse’s new tack of lending via its private bank has helped it make significant in-roads with Greek shipping magnates - among the richest in the industry - in the past year, capitalising on RBS’s exit from Greece.

Leading Greek shipping tycoon John Angelicoussis is among those that Credit Suisse has helped finance, Thomson Reuters LPC data shows.

“Presently, Credit Suisse seems to be shedding off part of the smaller (ship) owner portfolio and those who are not top tier names with top tier deposits,” said Karatzas. “There is a focus away from the transactional aspect of business towards the relationship-driven business that lowers costs and risks but also builds up on the bank’s traditional core strengths.”

Credit Suisse has taken a similar approach towards aviation and real estate.

Shipping and real estate lending are both bigger businesses than aviation for the bank, the source familiar with the matter said.

RISK APPETITE

Credit Suisse, whose assets under management have hit a record high of 751 billion francs this year, saw a 7 percent rise in net new money in the first nine months of 2017.

By comparison UBS’s flagship wealth management division, with 1.1 trillion francs, reported a 5 percent growth in net new money.

Credit Suisse’s earnings from lending in wealth management have risen 5.8 percent this year, while UBS’s division is down 1 percent.

Any gain that Credit Suisse can make in private banking is valuable as the lender comes off back-to-back multi-billion dollar full-year losses amid a major restructure under Thiam.

It remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of its private bank’s lending tactics will outweigh the risks.

But its arch-rival is not following its approach.

The head of UBS’s wealth management division, Juerg Zeltner, told Reuters in September the bank has no plans to increase risk appetite with regards to lending.

Allowing Northern Ireland to retain some access has been floated by the European Parliament’s Brexit pointman, Guy Verhofstadt.

“We will leave the European Union in 2019 as one United Kingdom,” the British minister for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, said on Monday. “We need to ensure that nothing is done that undermines the integrity of the UK single market.”

“I find it difficult to image how Northern Ireland could somehow remain in while the rest of the country leaves. I find it impossible,” he told a seminar in Brussels.

Brokenshire reiterated Prime Minister Theresa May’s insistence that the United Kingdom would be exiting both as a result of the 2016 referendum.

London has proposed an “invisible border” without border posts or immigration checks between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. But it has given no firm ideas on customs arrangements and the EU side has been mostly critical, saying these plans are unrealistic.

Dublin has said it will not let Brexit negotiations move from the divorce talks to discussions about future trade relations between Britain and the EU - as London is pushing for - without more guarantees on the border.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has demanded more guarantees that the Irish issue would be solved even if the future trade talks between Britain and the remaining 27 EU states collapse.

Brokenshire said some agricultural laws in Northern Ireland -- which is trying to reach agreement on how to relaunch its regional executive that is ruled at arm’s length from London -- were already different than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

He signaled Belfast could keep some of its laws closer to those of the EU after Brexit to minimize trade disruptions across the future border.

He also said London was keen to preserve the single electricity market on the island of Ireland and hoped for close cooperation with Dublin, including on security matters, after Britain leaves, as is now due to happen in March, 2019.

British and EU negotiators will meet in Brussels again this Thursday and Friday for more Brexit talks that have been grinding slowly, unnerving investors and businesses who demand clarity to plan their future operations.",'Impossible' for Northern Ireland to 'somehow' stay in EU formats after Brexit: UK minister,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland-nireland/impossible-for-northern-ireland-to-somehow-stay-in-eu-formats-after-brexit-uk-minister-idUKKBN1D626L

Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud poses for a photo with National Guard Minister Khaled bin Ayyaf and Economy Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri during a swearing-in ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, November 6, 2017. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS

Saudi Arabia has practised a form of collective leadership since the death of the founder King Abdulazziz in 1953 and especially since the abdication of his son King Saud in 1964.

The crown has descended among the younger sons of Abdulazziz, with each son and his family tending to control one element of the state.

Prince Faisal and then his son controlled the foreign ministry for decades. Prince Sultan controlled the defence ministry; Prince Nayef, the interior ministry and security forces.

Prince Abdullah controlled the National Guard, a well-armed militia recruited from the royal family’s traditional tribal supporters. And Prince Salman served as governor of Riyadh.

The system was intended to avoid the concentration of too much power in any one branch of the family and give all the sons of the founding king a stake in it.

While formal power has always resided with the monarch, in practice the king was expected to consult with other senior members of the royal family and rule by consensus.

The Saudi system of government has been more prime-ministerial than presidential.

In fact, the king has always been concurrently the prime minister, while the crown prince has served as deputy prime minister, and other senior princes have served as ministers in a formal cabinet.

But the system has been fundamentally altered in a number of important ways since the death of King Abdullah and the accession of King Salman in 2015.

POWER CONSOLIDATION

King Abdullah was predeceased by both his intended successors, Prince Sultan and Prince Nayef, so the crown passed to Prince Salman.

Prince Muqrin, an even younger son of King Abdulazziz, was designated as crown prince and heir apparent, but had little institutional power or influence within the royal family.

Muqrin was replaced a few months later by Mohammed bin Nayef, one of the sons of Prince Nayef, who had inherited control of the interior ministry and the security forces from his late father.

In turn, Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as crown prince by the king’s own son, Mohammed bin Salman, in 2017.

Mohammed bin Salman had already become defence minister, thereby ending the control that Sultan’s family had previously exercised over the armed forces.

With the removal of Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince and interior minister, the Nayef family’s control of the interior ministry was also effectively ended.

The last remaining “power ministry” was the National Guard, where control had been inherited by King Abdullah’s son Prince Miteb.

So the decision this weekend to remove Prince Miteb has eliminated the last remaining independent power base within the royal family.

For the first time, all three power ministries (defence, interior and National Guard) are under the direct control of one branch of the royal family.

Personnel changes for lower-ranked cabinet positions, sub-cabinet posts and provincial governors over the last three years have all removed independent power brokers and reinforced the concentration of power.

Control over all elements of the state has steadily consolidated power in the hands of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN

Saudi Arabia’s internal power dynamics are also changing in other important ways.

The cardinal rule has always been that disputes are settled quietly within the royal family, without the involvement of outsiders.

Princes were expected to show loyalty to the king and avoid overt calls for change in the system. In exchange, their personal security and wealth were respected.

Ostentatious displays of wealth have been discouraged and occasionally censured, but for the most part, princes have been free to accumulate money and business interests.

But in a fundamental breach with past practice, King Salman and his son have launched an anti-corruption campaign and arrested ministers and officials suspected of taking bribes and embezzlement.

The progressive removal of senior princes from government over the last three years, and now the wave of arrests of princes and ministers, is jeopardising the safety and wealth of royal family members for the first time.

Corruption has been rife in Saudi Arabia for decades and has drained fabulous amounts of wealth from the state into private hands, with much of it ending up abroad.

But corruption exists as part of a vast patronage system which ties together the royal family, the state bureaucracy and large parts of society in patron-client networks.

The anti-corruption campaign and decision to arrest senior ministers and even princes is therefore targeting the very structure of the Saudi state.

Whether this is a good thing depends on your view. Power-sharing and clientelism have underpinned the stability of the Saudi state but are also blamed for its inability to change and adapt.

APPEAL TO YOUNG SAUDIS

Saudi Arabia’s high birth-rate and declining infant mortality have seen a surge in the population over the last four decades with the result that the majority of the population is under 30 years old.

The biggest social and economic challenge for the kingdom is finding enough well-paid jobs for the hundreds of thousands of young Saudis entering the workforce each year.

Unemployment and under-employment are widespread, as is frustration with the fierce system of social and religious controls introduced after the siege at the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist militants in 1979.

As part of his bid to consolidate power, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has explicitly courted support from younger Saudis with promises of social liberalisation, jobs and faster change.

The anti-corruption campaign is likely to be very popular with younger Saudis frustrated by stagnating economic opportunities, but it threatens much of the country’s business, political and social establishment.

In any political system, anti-corruption campaigns are a powerful way to bid for popular support to settle intra-elite battles.

In ancient Rome, rulers used corruption charges to eliminate enemies. England’s King Henry VIII used corruption charges against his powerful minister Cardinal Wolsey and the monasteries.

China’s President Xi Jinping has successfully used anti-corruption to reshape China’s Communist Party. And U.S. President Donald Trump is trying his own version with promises to “drain the swamp”.

POLITICAL RISKS

The concentration of so much power in Saudi Arabia in one branch of the royal family introduces a new dynamic to the country’s government and heightens risk, though it also makes bold reforms more likely.

Recent events have sidelined other branches of the family and for the first time threatened their security, so the crown prince has made many enemies, though he may also have reduced their power to challenge him.

Collective leadership has been replaced by a much more personal form of rule, which also means that the crown prince will be held personally accountable for the government’s performance.

If the crown prince’s economic and social transformation plan was to falter or fail, his control is now at greater risk. The Saudi state therefore needs a swift return to economic growth and job creation.

In terms of oil policy, the Saudi state can ill-afford another decline in prices, decline in oil revenues and resumption of austerity.

The Saudi state’s existing preference for $70 oil (even at the risk of reviving U.S. shale production) rather than $50 oil (and risk a return to austerity) will become more pronounced.

Given the delicate political and economic context, Saudi Arabia will prefer to risk tightening the oil market too much rather than too little.",Column: Saudi purge takes kingdom into unpredictable new era: Kemp,https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-kemp/column-saudi-purge-takes-kingdom-into-unpredictable-new-era-kemp-idINKBN1D620C

Japan has fared better following the U.S. election than might have been expected. Abe rushed to meet Trump soon after he won and has since maintained close contact. The result has been a better rapport than most world leaders enjoy with the disrupter-in-chief. And despite Trump’s hatred of trade imbalances, his transactional worldview, and radical suggestions during the campaign about Asian security, America has recommitted to the longstanding alliance.

The latest face-to-face talks are likely to focus on the threat across the Sea of Japan. That makes sense: both men take a similarly dim view of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And Tokyo fears being surprised by a U.S. strike, which could have unpredictable consequences.

Abe mostly likes the economic status quo, though. Maintaining it will be a challenge given Trump’s instincts, and the $57 billion trade surplus Japan ran last year with the United States. Tokyo does not want a bilateral trade deal forcing down the gap by opening up sensitive markets such as rice. It prefers bigger pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it has helped stitch back together after the U.S. withdrawal. Any pressure to strengthen the yen, now comfortably weak at 114 per dollar, would also be worrying. It could derail a lengthening upturn in growth.

As Takuji Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors notes, Abe already has successfully separated the “potentially thorny trade issues” from the top political relationship. These are now being handled separately by Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy PM Taro Aso.

The arrangement turns such matters into slower-burn, more technocratic issues. That has been yielding small wins for both sides: most recently on persimmons and potatoes, for example.

ティラーソン米国務長官が中東を歴訪した目的はただ２つ。イランに対抗する地域的枠組みにイラクを取り込むこと、そしてカタールに対する禁輸措置を終了するようサウジアラビアを説得することだった。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。カタールで２４日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。サウジアラビアの首都リヤドで２２日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。＊筆者はロイターのコラムニスト。元ロイターの防衛担当記者で、現在はシンクタンク「Project for Study of the 21st Century（ＰＳ２１）」を立ち上げ、理事を務める。＊本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。（翻訳：エァクレーレン）＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。,"［２７日 ロイター］ -

だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。

過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。

実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。

トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。

問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。

いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。

米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。

中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。

シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。

ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。

これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。

だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。

湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。

カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。

しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。

ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。

ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。

しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。

イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。

米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。

ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。

米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。

米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。

だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。

The decision to endorse a measure advancing in the U.S. Senate could clear the way for Congress to pass the first rewrite of a law adopted 21 years ago that is widely considered a bedrock legal shield for the internet industry.

Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said in a statement it supported a bipartisan proposal advancing in the U.S. Senate making it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.

“Important changes made to (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,” Beckerman said. His organization represents tech companies including Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O).

This week, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said it would vote next week on the bill authored by Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Richard Blumenthal.

The internet industry has fought such a change in the law for years, but now Washington is stepping up scrutiny on the sector on a range of policy issues after decades of hands-off regulation.

U.S. technology companies had long opposed any legislation seeking to amend Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it is a bedrock legal protection for the internet that could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation.

The dollar was 0.04 pct higher against the Japanese yen, and the euro was 0.16 percent lower against the greenback.

“In the absence of any major external drivers, it is more of a sideways market when it comes to the dollar,” said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. “Between now and the end of the year, we still have to deal with the tax bill, the Fed (Open Market Committee), and obviously there are some uncertainties around trade policy as well.”

House Republicans last week unveiled the first draft of a bill that, if enacted, would be the biggest revamp of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s.

The House tax-writing committee begins revising the bill on Monday, with tweaks and some more substantial changes expected to a number of individual and corporate tax proposals.

On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York confirmed that William Dudley, among the most influential monetary policymakers throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath, expects to retire by mid-2018. That raised another question over leadership at the U.S. central bank less than a week after President Donald Trump chose a new Fed chief.

“Investors may be less inclined to deploy risk at this time,” Issa said.

The dollar benefited from Commodity Futures Trading Commission data from late on Friday that showed net short positions in the currency had dwindled to their smallest in 15 weeks.

Sterling rose 0.28 percent against the dollar, recovering some ground from a one-month low hit after the Bank of England raised its lending rate for the first time in a decade last Thursday but forecast only gradual tightening ahead.

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

An autopsy will determine the cause of death, Martin said.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said in an interview that the family members had not been present at the time of Kelley’s attack

“I heard that (the in-laws) attended church from time to time,” Tackitt said. “Not on a regular basis.”

The attack, which killed people ranging from 18 months to 77 years old, came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest by a single gunman in the United States.

Officials warned that 10 of the wounded remained in critical condition on Monday morning.","Texas church gunman sent threatening texts to in-laws, officials say",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D510F-OCATP

Paul’s neighbor, Rene Boucher, has been charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury in connection with the incident on Friday, according to authorities. Boucher, 59, was released on bond.

“Senator Paul has five rib fractures including three displaced fractures. This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, said in a statement, according to multiple media reports.

“It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying,” the reports quoted Stafford as saying. He added that the senator’s type of injury could lead to life-threatening injuries.

Paul, 54, also has lung contusions, Stafford said in the statement, according to the reports.

The Bowling Green Daily News, citing an arrest warrant, said Paul told police his neighbor came on to his property in a gated community just east of Bowling Green and tackled him from behind. Paul had injuries to the face and trouble breathing because of a rib injury, the newspaper said.

It was not clear what motivated the altercation and Paul did not go to the hospital, police said. Paul was mowing his lawn at the time of the attack, television station WAVE-TV in Kentucky reported.

“Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Friday’s unfortunate event. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers,” Paul said on Twitter on Sunday morning, referring to his wife.

A man who answered Boucher’s phone on Sunday, when a Reuters reporter asked to speak with him, said: “I‘m sorry. I can’t talk.”

Kentucky State Police said on Saturday that Paul and Boucher were acquaintances. The suspect is a retired physician, the Bowling Green Daily News said.

The New York Daily News reported that a Facebook page for Boucher contained numerous postings critical of Republican President Donald Trump.

Apple sold 75.5 million iPhones in the October-December quarter, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount, 1 million more than what was sold in the year-ago quarter. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic - GF20000107877

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal. The Trump administration backed Apple’s view.",Supreme Court rejects Samsung appeal of patent loss to Apple,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-samsung-elec/supreme-court-rejects-samsung-appeal-of-patent-loss-to-apple-idUKKBN1D61W4

The Bank of England’s decision to increase official UK borrowing costs for the first time in a decade has a more dismal logic. Governor Mark Carney and his fellow rate-setters have concluded that leaving the European Union will permanently lower Britain’s growth prospects.

Raising the UK bank rate for the first time since July 2007 should have been a milestone in Britain’s recovery from the financial crisis. In fact, the quarter-percentage point increase merely cancels out the cut that followed last year’s referendum. The rationale for changing course is more significant.

The central bank believes Brexit will hobble Britain’s growth potential. Leaving the EU will reverse some of the effects of globalisation that have put a downward pressure on prices and wages. Withdrawing from the EU single market will add friction to close to half of Britain’s exports. The UK will attract fewer immigrants, and companies will invest less.

Those shifts may ultimately enable British workers to demand higher wages. But low productivity means prices will also rise more quickly. The BoE reckons the UK’s potential output is growing by just 1.5 percent a year – below the 1.7 percent increase in GDP it forecasts for the next three years. In short, though the British economy is expanding at a slower pace than in the past, this may be unsustainable.

This analysis does not make raising interest rates now a foregone conclusion. Though inflation reached 3 percent in September and unemployment is low, there’s little evidence of wage pressure. Meanwhile, consumers’ incomes are being squeezed.

Carney sought to ease the pain by signalling that official rates would rise in line with expectations in financial markets – implying just two more quarter-percent increases by the end of 2020. The governor may also worry about the risks that a weak exchange rate pose to Britain’s ability to finance its current account deficit.

After the BoE last hiked rates, it was forced to slash them by 4.75 percentage points in the following 18 months as the global financial crisis tipped the UK into recession. The latest increase may also prove a mistake.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

“Die EZB muss akzeptieren, dass die Inflation in der Zukunft niedriger sein kann, als wir es gewöhnt waren”, sagte Stark der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters am Rande einer Veranstaltung in Den Haag. Dann müssten die Währungshüter auch nicht mehr die Finanzmärkte verzerren. Nach Auffassung des Ökonomen macht die EZB dies mit ihren billionschweren Anleihenkäufen, die vor allem in Deutschland umstritten sind. Stark war vor sechs Jahren im Streit über das Vorgehen der EZB in der Euro-Schuldenkrise von seinem Posten zurückgetreten. Sein Nachfolger als EZB-Chefvolkswirt wurde der Belgier Peter Praet.

Aus Sicht von Stark hat die niedrige Inflation mit dazu beigetragen, das Wirtschaftswachstum im Euro-Raum auf das derzeitige Niveau zu hieven. “Sie hat das verfügbare Einkommen der Haushalte angehoben und wie eine Steuererleichterung gewirkt.” Die EZB verfehlt bereits seit Frühjahr 2013 ihr Ziel einer Teuerung von knapp unter zwei Prozent, die sie als ideal für die Wirtschaft erachtet. Im Oktober hatte die Notenbank angesichts der verbesserten wirtschaftlichen Lage beschlossen, ab Januar das monatliche Volumen bei den Anleihenkäufen auf 30 Milliarden Euro zu halbieren, die Transaktionen aber bis mindestens Ende September 2018 zu verlängern. Mit den Käufen soll für mehr Inflation gesorgt werden.

Stark zufolge zählen möglicherweise die zunehmende Globalisierung und technologische Neuerungen zu den Faktoren, die die Inflation nachhaltig dämpfen. Ein enges Ziel würde daher zu immer mehr Notenbank-Interventionen führen. “Eine Zentralbank kann die Inflationsrate nicht so feinjustieren, wie es die EZB zu tun versucht.” Der Vorschlag des früheren Bundesbank-Vorstands an die Euro-Wächter: “Akzeptiert eine geringere Inflation, so dass ihr nicht die Marktwirtschaft schädigt.”",Ex-Bundesbanker - EZB muss sich an niedrigere Inflation gewöhnen,https://www.reuters.com/article/ezb-inflation-starck-idDEKBN1D625M

The court’s decision means Puigdemont, who left Spain last month after Madrid fired his secessionist government and dissolved the Catalan parliament, is free to campaign for independence in an election in the region on Dec 21.

Puigdemont said on Monday his government’s actions were legitimate and criticized the Spanish judicial system for a “clear lack of independence and neutrality”.

The December vote is shaping up to be a de facto independence referendum.

Puigdemont’s PDeCAT and another secessionist party said at the weekend they might run on a combined ticket, but would need to make a decision on any formal alliance - which might also include other parties - by a deadline of Tuesday.

Alliances could however also form after the election.

The independence push has dragged Spain into its worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. It has deeply divided the country, fuelling anti-Spanish feelings in Catalonia and nationalist tendencies elsewhere.

Puigdemont turned himself in to Belgian police on Sunday along with four of his ex-ministers, after Spain issued a European arrest warrant on charges of rebellion as well as misuse of public funds.

All five are barred from leaving Belgium without a judge’s consent.

They will appear before a Belgian court on Nov. 17 for a hearing to discuss the arrest warrant, prosecutors in Brussels said in a statement.

CALL FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION

Puigdemont, writing in Britain’s Guardian newspaper, called for scrutiny of the Spanish judicial system and said the crisis could be solved only with a political and not a judicial solution.

“Does anyone think that the sacked Catalan government can expect a fair and independent hearing, uninfluenced by political and media pressure? I do not,” he wrote.

Spain’s central government took control of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, after local leaders held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 despite a Constitutional Court ban.

The region’s parliament then passed a unilateral declaration of independence. In response, Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy fired the government and called the snap regional elections.

Eight of Puigdemont’s allies stayed behind in Spain and have been detained on similar accusations to the ones the deposed leader faces.

On Sunday, the first part of a GAD3 survey showed that pro-independence parties would win the election in Catalonia but may not gain the parliamentary majority needed to continue with secession.

On Monday, the second part showed just one in seven people in the region believe the current standoff between Barcelona and Madrid will end in independence, while more than two thirds think the process has been bad for the economy.

Published in La Vanguardia newspaper, that survey polled 1,233 people between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3.

Optimism that a negotiated solution would be found was low, with just over a fifth of respondents thinking the crisis would lead to talks between regional authorities and Madrid.

WhatsApp, which is widely used in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, said message encryption prevented it from monitoring the third-party providers Indonesians use to search for GIFs.

It asked the government to work with the providers instead.

Semuel Pangerapan, a director general at Indonesia’s communications and informatics ministry, said WhatsApp would be blocked within 48 hours unless the images supplied by third parties were taken off the service.

“Yes, true. They have to follow the rules of the host,” Pangerapan said of the proposed block.

The ministry had sent three letters to WhatsApp over the issue, he said.

“They have responded, but asked us to speak directly to the third party. The GIFs appeared in their apps. Why do we have to be the one speaking to the third party? They are supposed to be the ones managing it,” said Pangerapan.

Tenor, a third-party provider of GIFs to WhatsApp, had been blocked, Pangerapan said.

Tenor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“In Indonesia, WhatsApp lets people search for GIFs using third-party providers,” a Whatsapp representative said in a statement.

“We are not able to monitor GIFs on WhatsApp since content is end-to-end encrypted. We’ve directed the Indonesia government to work with these third-party providers to review their content.”

Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users as of the first quarter of 2014, ranking the country fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, company data showed.

Some reaction on Indonesian social media to the threatened block was skeptical. ”While you’re at it, why don’t you block Twitter too, (and) if necessary all browsers in the Playstore, because it’s way easier to search for porn there than on WhatsApp,” wrote one Twitter user, with the handle @jnessy.

Another, using the handle @yogirswnt, said “Does the government want to block WhatsApp? In the case of Telegram it was only a bluff, but if true, it is so unfortunate.”

Indonesia briefly blocked access this year to some channels of the Telegram messaging app, saying its forums were “full of radicals and terrorist propaganda”, before reaching a pact with the messaging service on how to rein in propaganda.

Talks on how goods and services will flow between Britain and the European Union after Brexit in March 2019 have made slow progress, fueling fears of an exodus of multinational firms.

Speaking to business leaders, May said she understood the importance of clarity for employers and that she hoped for an “implementation period” that would allow the same trading conditions to continue for around two years after Brexit.

But the president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the government’s Brexit strategy reminded him of a soap opera with a different episode each week and that Britain was less united than the EU’s 27 other states.

“Brexit is only 508 days away, but for many businesses their alarm clocks are set earlier than that: They’re set to the moment they’ll actually enact their contingency plans,” CBI President Paul Drechsler said just before May spoke.

“The clock is ticking, so government and the EU need to get a move on... First of all sorting out, with clarity, details on a transitional arrangement.”

A top executive with U.S. automaker Ford also warned of the negative impact a continuing lack of clarity could have.

“If business conditions moving forward mean the UK is not competitive, then we will have to make the decision to adjust and do something else,” said Steven Armstrong, Ford’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa.

“Which is why it’s very important that we get a clear view of what the final agreement (with the EU) is going to be and assurances that we have the transition agreement for a period of time so we can plan and adjust accordingly.”

BT (BT.L), Britain’s biggest telecoms company, said unless businesses were clear by early 2018 about the terms of a transition they would need to plan for a damaging “hard Brexit”.

CLIFF-EDGE

Ever since the June 2016 EU referendum, business leaders have been calling on the government to give them clarity about how Brexit will look, though ministers say that is impossible, given that the exit terms have still to be negotiated.

“I know how important it is for business and industry not to face a cliff-edge and to have the time it needs to plan and prepare for the new arrangements,” May told the CBI conference.

“I want us to agree the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible.”

But May, who recently unnerved executives by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement is sealed, had little detail on timing.

“We are in a negotiation with the European Union ... First of all we need to get full agreement that this is something that will happen, and then we’ll need to negotiate the details,” she said in response to a question from Reuters.

“Of course, some of those details, you need to know what the end state is, what that future partnership is, because this is about practical change.”

May’s Brexit minister has said previously he wants an outline transitional deal in early 2018.

Almost two in three British firms will have implemented contingency plans by March if Britain and the EU have not struck a transitional deal by then, a CBI survey said. Another survey said most European businesses plan to cut back orders from British suppliers because of the slow progress of Brexit talks.

While Britain’s economy has shown unexpected resilience since the Brexit vote, there are signs of weakness including slowing growth and accelerating inflation.

Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as an undemocratic and costly experiment in European integration they say is doomed to fail.

India has committed $500 million to the Chabahar port that it is building as a way to bypass rival Pakistan and crack open a trade and transport route to landlocked Afghanistan, as well as the resource-rich countries of central Asia.

New Delhi plans to send seven shipments of wheat to Afghanistan through Chabahar by the end of January. A first shipment arrived last week from India’s western Kandla port, after years of political wrangling with Pakistan, government officials in New Delhi and Kabul said. The wheat will be trucked from Chabahar to western Afghanistan.

India is expanding its economic diplomacy in Afghanistan, seeing itself as a regional power. But Pakistan says India is trying to use Afghanistan as a base to destabilise Pakistan, and has long blocked India from conducting bilateral trade with Afghanistan using its territory as transit.

The shipments are meant to demonstrate the route’s viability, officials said, and the plan is to broaden the cargo flow before the port is fully operational by the end of next year.

“Things are moving quite well and as planned,” Saurabh Kumar, Indian ambassador to Iran, said in an email.

So far, the United States, keen for India to do more to help stabilise Afghanistan through economic and security assistance, has held off public criticism of renewed Indian efforts to develop the Iranian corridor.

India’s ties with Iran came up during U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s talks in New Delhi last month, and the top U.S. diplomat said America would not stand in the way of projects that help the Iranian people.

But he warned that the administration would crack down on financial benefits accruing to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the country’s most powerful security entity, blamed for fuelling regional proxy wars.

GATEWAY

India has framed its involvement in Chabahar’s development as primarily about establishing a gateway to Afghanistan, more than Iran itself, Indian officials and a Western diplomatic source said.

Washington has not intervened directly in the port’s development, but, previously, India drastically cut back its oil imports from Iran, one of its main suppliers, in the face of international sanctions on Tehran for its suspected nuclear programme.

“In general, I get the impression that conservative analysts in (Washington) DC have accepted the fact that India will maintain some form of relationship with Iran,” said Jeff Smith, a south Asia expert at The Heritage Foundation in Washington.

“They recognize that for India, Iran is more about a transport corridor to Afghanistan; that it has no interest in advancing Iran’s agenda in the Middle East; and that whatever space India evacuates there will be filled by China.”

An Indian government source said India Global Ports Ltd (IGPL), a company set up by the government to lead the Chabahar project, had held talks with Iranian authorities to begin interim operations.

In August, IGPL applied for permission to establish a company to run the port, the source said. The plan is for IGPL to build two new terminals, one for container vessels and one for multipurpose ships.

After some delay, IGPL awarded contracts last month for port construction equipment such as cranes, the source said. Iran, meanwhile, had completed the construction of a jetty.

“We are moving slowly, but there is movement on the port development despite U.S.-Iran relations deteriorating,” said Meena Singh Roy, an expert on India-Iran ties at the government-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.","India cracks open Iran sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing rival",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-iran-port/india-cracks-open-iran-sea-route-to-afghanistan-bypassing-rival-idINKBN1D61W2

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition’s announcement.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

A National Supervision Commission that combines several anti-graft bodies, set to be launched next year, will spearhead Xi’s campaign and expand its scope beyond the ruling Communist Party to any civil servant.

At last month’s five-yearly party congress, Xi pledged to continue the campaign to root out deep-seated corruption in the party, which has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials.

The public has a deadline of Dec. 5 to comment on the draft, but the largely rubber-stamp legislature did not say when the final law would be implemented.

The new commission will be empowered to investigate, interrogate and detain government workers, besides freezing their assets and seizing property, the draft released by the parliament, the National People’s Congress, shows.

The new law would further centralize the power of anti-graft investigations and apply to bureaucrats, including teachers at government schools and managers at state-owned enterprises.

The draft gave new details of a detention system to replace a controversial practice of questioning suspects at undisclosed sites without legal representation, known as “shuanggui”, which rights activists say carries the threat of torture and abuse.

The new measures can be used when the case is “major” or “sensitive”, when a subject is at risk of fleeing or suicide, when there is danger of collusion or evidence tampering or other forms of obstruction to the investigation, the draft said.

Detained suspects must sign off on all confessions and their family or work unit should be notified within 24 hours, it added, with a three-month limit on the interrogation that can be doubled in “special circumstances”, which it did not specify.

The draft includes measures to monitor the finances of those suspected of graft, to avoid their fleeing overseas.

Separately, the Party’s official People’s Daily on Monday provided frontpage details of trial commissions launched in January in the capital, Beijing, and the eastern province of Zhejiang and northern Shanxi.

In Zhejiang, the commission handled than 24,000 cases from January to August, more than double the number handled by the authorities during the year-ago period, Xinhua said.

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal.

The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 51.7 last month - its highest since June - from 50.7 in September.

In July and August, the index was below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.

During those months, confusion over product pricing following the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax pushed manufacturing and services sectors into contraction.

Secondo le proiezioni di Rai e La7, il candidato presidente del centrodestra Nello Musumeci ha vinto le elezioni regionali in Sicilia. Il candidato del M5s Giancarlo Cancelleri lo segue a poca distanza, ma lo spoglio ufficiale è ancora in corso.

“Il Pd è politicamente defunto. A quello che leggo oggi sui giornali in interviste di esponenti Pd, non sappiamo neanche se Renzi sarà il candidato premier del centro sinistra”, ha scritto ancora Di Maio.

La scorsa settimana Di Maio ha superato per la prima volta Renzi in un sondaggio Ixé sulla fiducia nei leader politici. Di Maio è al 32% (dopo il premier Paolo Gentiloni, al 39%), Renzi al 27%.

“Luigi Di Maio mi ha sfidato a un confronto televisivo... Ha fatto tutto lui. Io ho semplicemente accettato perché Di Maio è il leader del Movimento 5 stelle che in tutti i sondaggi se la batte con il Pd per il primo posto nel proporzionale”, ha risposto, sempre su Facebook, Renzi, confermando che domani sera parteciperà alla trasmissione tv “Di Martedì”.

“E siccome due milioni di italiani mi hanno chiesto sei mesi fa di guidare il Pd, ho pensato fosse un gesto di rispetto accettare un confronto pubblico e trasparente davanti agli italiani”, ha concluso l‘ex premier.

US-JOBDATEN BEREITEN BÜHNE FÜR DEZEMBER-ZINSERHÖHUNG

Auch an der Wall Street ging es für Dow-Jones und S&P weiter nach oben. Ein schwächer als erwartet ausgefallener US-Stellenaufbau bremste nur vorübergehend. Am US-Arbeitsmarkt entstanden im Oktober 261.000 statt der erwarteten 310.000 Jobs. Dennoch steckte die US-Wirtschaft den Dämpfer durch die Wirbelstürme “Harvey” und “Irma” insgesamt gut weg. “Auf den zweiten Blick ist es nicht so schlimm wie gedacht, da es deutliche Aufwärtsrevisionen für den vorangegangenen Monat gibt”, sagt Anlageexperte Brad McMillan vom US-Brokerhaus Commonwealth Financial.

Damit ist die Bühne für die dritte geldpolitische Straffung in diesem Jahr bereitet: Händler sehen eine Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Dezember-Erhöhung bei 90 Prozent. Zuletzt hatte die Fed den Zins im Juni auf 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent hochgesetzt.

APPLE-HYPE STECKT AN - ANLEGER MÖGEN NEUEN-FED-CHEF

Im Technologiesektor steckten der Hype um den Verkaufsstart des iPhone X und ein rosiger Ausblick auf das Weihnachtsgeschäft von Apple die Anleger an. Die Apple-Aktie legte um 3,7 Prozent zu und erreichte mit 174,26 Dollar einen neuen Höchststand. Damit knackte der Konzern aus Kalifornien erstmals die Marke von 900 Milliarden Dollar bei der Marktbewertung - Analysten zufolge dürfte schon bald die Schwelle von einer Billion Dollar überschritten werden.

Auch Zulieferer standen hoch im Kurs: Größter Dax-Gewinner waren die Aktien des Münchner Chipherstellers Infineon mit einem Aufschlag von 1,7 Prozent. Dialog Semiconductor waren mit einem Plus von 2,3 Prozent unter den gefragtesten Werten im Technologie-Index TecDax. STMicroelectronics legten in Mailand 2,5 Prozent auf ein 13 1/2-Jahres-Hoch von 20,96 Euro zu.

Gut kam bei Investoren auch die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von US-Notenbankchefin Janet Yellen an. Der 64-Jährige steht für Kontinuität in der Geldpolitik. “Mit ihm dürfte der von der Fed eingeschlagene Kurs gradueller Leitzinsanhebungen fortgesetzt werden”, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank. Powell stehe zudem einer etwas lockeren Regulierung des Finanzdienstleistungssektors offen gegenüber.

“Government of Afghanistan isn’t going to ban any social media platforms. WhatsApp and Telegram to continue operating in Afghanistan,” Javid Faisal, deputy spokesman to government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah wrote on Twitter.

The row over instant messaging services began after a letter from Afghanistan’s telecoms regulator to Internet service providers telling them to block the services “without delay” was circulated on social media platforms last week.

WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, has more than a billion users worldwide. Telegram is a much smaller but fast growing instant messaging service that is popular in a number of countries including Afghanistan.

The acting minister for telecommunications said last week that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received from consumers.

Afghan media have reported that Afghanistan’s National Directorate for Security (NDS) wanted the ban to stop the Taliban and other insurgent groups from using encrypted messages. The NDS has not commented.

Throughout the controversy, the messaging platforms appeared to have continued to function normally in Afghanistan.

The episode, which attracted criticism from civil rights groups and furious comments on social media, underlined the importance Internet and mobile services of all kinds have gained in Afghanistan, notably among government officials themselves.","Afghanistan will not block WhatsApp, Telegram: spokesman",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-will-not-block-whatsapp-telegram-spokesman-idINKBN1D61V5

Paul’s neighbor, Rene Boucher, has been charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury in connection with the incident on Friday, according to authorities. Boucher, 59, was released on bond.

“Senator Paul has five rib fractures including three displaced fractures. This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, said in a statement, according to multiple media reports.

“It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying,” the reports quoted Stafford as saying. He added that the senator’s type of injury could lead to life-threatening injuries.

Paul, 54, also has lung contusions, Stafford said in the statement, according to the reports.

The Bowling Green Daily News, citing an arrest warrant, said Paul told police his neighbor came on to his property in a gated community just east of Bowling Green and tackled him from behind. Paul had injuries to the face and trouble breathing because of a rib injury, the newspaper said.

It was not clear what motivated the altercation and Paul did not go to the hospital, police said. Paul was mowing his lawn at the time of the attack, television station WAVE-TV in Kentucky reported.

“Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Friday’s unfortunate event. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers,” Paul said on Twitter on Sunday morning, referring to his wife.

Resta invece fuori dai giochi, senza sorprese, il candidato del Pd e di Ap, Fabrizio Micari.

Lo spoglio ufficiale delle schede è cominciato alle 8,00. Alle 12,30 con 796 sezioni scrutinate su 5.300, Musumeci è al 40,48%, Cancelleri al 34,61%. Seguono Micari col 18,38% e Claudio Fava, candidato della sinistra, con il 5,83%.

Le proiezioni sono realizzate sulla base dei risultati reali di un campione di seggi ritenuto significativo.

Secondo Emg per La7, alla sesta proiezione, Musumeci è al 38,9%, Cancelleri al 35,6%. Per la settima proiezione Piepoli-Noto per la Rai, Musumeci è al 38%, Cancelleri al 36%.

Il distacco tra i due sta aumentando lievemente a beneficio del candidato di centrodestra. Gli exit poll davano Musumeci in testa con una forchetta 36-40% rispetto a Cancelleri dato al 33-37%.

Per il momento non è ancora chiaro se il presidente eletto avrà anche la maggioranza assoluta in consiglio regionale.

L‘affluenza è in leggero calo rispetto a 5 anni fa e non arriva al 47%.

Resta al palo invece l‘alleanza Pd-Ap. Nel 2012, il Pd era riuscito ad eleggere presidente Rosario Crocetta, ma senza maggioranza assoluta dei consiglieri e con diversi rimpasti di giunta nel corso degli anni.

Il leader democratico Matteo Renzi aveva detto che il voto siciliano, che precede di pochi mesi quello delle politiche e vede in campo i tre schieramenti principali, non sarebbe stato un test nazionale.

Ma la divisione tra democratici e sinistra sperimentata in Sicilia rischia di pesare anche sul voto per il Parlamento.

Diversi esponenti Pd hanno ammesso la sconfitta già ieri sera, attribuendola alle divisioni. Il sottosegretario Davide Faraone, vicino a Renzi, ha attaccato il presidente del Senato Pietro Grasso, che ha rifiutato la candidatura in Sicilia. Grasso nei giorni scorsi ha lasciato il Pd per dissensi sulla legge elettorale.

Dato l‘esito deludente per il Pd del voto siciliano, il candidato premier del M5s, Luigi Di Maio, ha chiesto di annullare il dibattito tv di domani con Renzi [nL5N1NC2J6], dubitando che l‘ex premier sia ancora il leader del centrosinistra.

Renzi ha risposto a Di Maio che “un leader” non si sottrae al confronto.

Ross was responding in media interviews to reports on Sunday about his investments stemming from the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investment that relate to the affairs of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“There is nothing wrong with anything that was done,” Ross told CNBC, adding that he had not considered resigning following Sunday’s report. Ross is a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which the New York Times said earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for Russian petrochemical firm Sibur.

The Times, which based its report on files from prominent offshore law firm Appleby, said Sibur stakeholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and Putin associate who is subject to U.S. sanctions, and Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.

Navigator was mentioned in Ross’s 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. The Times said the latest batch of documents provided more insight into his financial holdings.

Reuters was not able to confirm the Times’ findings.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest such holdings.

The investments raised questions about whose interests Ross represents, Blumenthal said, calling for an inspector general probe by the department as well as congressional hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC in an interview.

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

SANCTIONS

In an earlier statement, a Department of Commerce spokesman said Ross “was not involved in Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur ... has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship”.

He added that Sibur had not been under sanctions when Navigator began its relationship with the publicly-traded firm and still was not.

“A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period. It was a normal commercial relationship and one that I had nothing to do with the creation of, and do not know the shareholders who were apparently sanctioned at some later point in time,” Ross told CNBC.

In a statement, Sibur said it had no direct dealings with Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.

Neither Navigator nor Appleby were available for comment on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Timchenko declined to comment, while Shamalov did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

In its report, the Times said Ross had kept the investment in Navigator, which increased its business dealings with Sibur, including chartering ships, even as Western nations sought to punish Russia’s energy sector over Putin’s incursions into Ukraine.

“The Secretary recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,” the Commerce Department spokesman said, adding that Ross maintains the “highest ethical standards.”

Separately, the Times cited Appleby’s files in another report that said hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin were behind Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner’s investments in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

QUEEN‘S TAXES

Citing the Appleby documents, Britain’s Guardian newspaper said millions of pounds from Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, had been invested in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio never before disclosed.

Reuters could not independently confirm the Guardian report.

The newspaper said the Duchy had used offshore private equity funds designed to shield investors in the United Kingdom from having to pay U.S. tax on their holdings.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.”

The spokeswoman also said the Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income received from the Duchy.

Citing the documents, Guardian also reported that international trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) had “secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars” to Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a mining deal in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The British newspaper said Gertler had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters was not immediately able to contact him.

Glencore said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, but dated Oct. 27 and addressed to the ICIJ, that it had made a loan to a company affiliated to Gertler in 2009 on commercial terms and that it was fully repaid.

“In February 2009, Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd made a loan to Lora Enterprises Limited (Lora), an entity affiliated with Mr Gertler,” the company said.

“The loan to Lora was made on commercial terms negotiated at arm’s length,” it said. “The loan was fully repaid by Lora in 2010.”",U.S. commerce chief Ross: Nothing improper about his Russia-tied investments,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-paradise-tax-usa/u-s-commerce-chief-ross-kept-holdings-in-russian-tied-firm-reports-idUKKBN1D6003

The South African firm, not for the first time, faces an uncertain future in the wake of a 30 percent plunge in its share price on Friday after it delayed annual financial results because it could not yet give a specific figure for the impact of an ongoing business review.

The company has said it has sufficient liquidity to fund it through a review that could include the sale of assets, job cuts and the renegotiation of loan agreements.

“There is no risk of closure,” Magara told Reuters on Monday, adding that the disposals of non-core greenfield projects and downstream processing capacity were on the table.

Tensions with some of its workers risk adding to the problems facing Lonmin.

Labour union Solidarity, which represents mostly skilled employees, said its members supported plans to go on strike next month or in January in a dispute over how the company handles investor relations.

The union would also apply to have Lonmin protected from creditors, a process called “business rescue” in South Africa, if the company pleads poverty to cut jobs, Solidarity General Secretary Gideon du Plessis told Reuters.

Magara was speaking at a ceremony to present new health and road projects Lonmin is funding near its mines west of Johannesburg.

“Our underlying operations are continuing to perform very well ... So that we have some bit of cash. Because a loss-making business would not be able to buy ambulances,” Magara said.

Lonmin was handing over a fleet of ambulances it has bought for the communities. It was also showcasing roads it has built.

Lonmin, one of the world’s top platinum producers, has been in the doldrums for years due to low prices and soaring costs and has been to shareholders for rights issues to shore up its balance sheet three times since 2009.

There has also been speculation about a deal to combine with fellow South African miner Sibanye-Stillwater.

Shares in Lonmin, which is listed in London and Johannesburg and has a market capitalisation of only around 200 million pounds ($260 million) remained volatile on Monday.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.","KABUL (Reuters) - The BBC is facing an angry reaction in Afghanistan after it changed the name of one of its local language Facebook pages to BBC Dari, the official name of the Afghan version of Persian or Farsi but one rejected by many local Persian speakers.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favoring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighboring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-bbc/bbc-name-change-stirs-language-row-in-afghanistan-idINKBN1D50NT

The Markit/Nikkei survey released on Monday showed its Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.4 from 51.0 in September.

The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 13th consecutive month and was at the highest level since August 2015.

The new business index also expanded rapidly to 53.8 in October from 52.0 in the previous month, the fastest pace since May 2013.

The strong demand and rising levels of new business encouraged the service sector to boost employment, extending the current sequence of increase to ten months.

In another positive sign, the index for business sentiment rose to a fourth-month high of 55.5 from 53.3 in September.

“The Japanese service sector made a strong start to the fourth quarter, with the headline business activity index hitting a 26-month high,” said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.

“In the wake of (Prime Minister) Shinzo Abe’s election victory, confidence among Japanese service providers lifted.”

Abe’s ruling coalition retained power with a comfortable victory in lower house elections last month, defeating a challenge from an upstart opposition party that threatened to alter the course of government policy.

The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rose to 53.4 from 51.7 in September to reach the highest level in five months.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

The Croatian replaced Sam Allardyce in June, 2015 and led West Ham to a seventh-placed finish in his first season. He also oversaw their move to the London Stadium but has won just two out of 11 league games in this campaign.

“West Ham United can confirm that Slaven Bilic has today left his position with the club,” West Ham said in a statement.

Former Everton, Manchester United and Sunderland manager David Moyes, who is currently out of work, has been strongly linked with the position.

West Ham said they “believe a change is now necessary in order for the club to move forward positively and in line with their ambition”.

“The club’s search for a new manager to take West Ham United forward is underway and an announcement regarding Bilic’s successor is expected to be made over the coming days,” the statement added.

Moyes told BeInSport on Sunday that he was willing to take on the challenge of keeping the Hammers in the Premier League.

“I’ve always said I want to go back into club management. If the right opportunity comes around, I’ll be interested.”

Asked about West Ham before Bilic’s sacking, the 54-year-old, who also had a brief and unsuccessful spell with Real Sociedad in Spain, said: “I am interested but at the moment that vacancy has not become available. I know what Slaven must be going through.”

Bilic, who played as a defender for West Ham, has been under pressure throughout this campaign and although a League Cup win over Tottenham bought him time, a draw at bottom club Crystal Palace and the heavy home loss to Liverpool sealed his fate.

West Ham’s joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold praised Bilic for his commitment and integrity.

“The board invested heavily signing the players Slaven believed would complete the squad he needed to push the club back towards the level we had reached in his first season, and we believe we have the players capable of doing that,” they said.

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUSKBN1D620V

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

The 38-year-old suggested last month he would retire at the end of the season and leaves the game with two Champions League titles, six Serie A crowns, the 2006 World Cup he won with Italy, as well as a host of other trophies and honours accumulated in more than 20 years.

“Not only my adventure in NY comes to an end but my journey as a football player as well,” Pirlo, who has 116 caps for his country, said in the message.

The midfielder made his senior debut for his hometown club Brescia at the age of 16 before moving to Inter Milan in 1998.

He struggled to nail down a starting place at Inter, where he was deployed behind the strikers, and was signed by city rivals AC Milan in 2001 with doubts looming over his effectiveness.

Pirlo played second fiddle to Rui Costa in his first season at Milan, where like at Inter he was deployed as a ‘trequartista’, a position where his lack of pace hindered him.

It was only under Carlo Ancelotti the following season that he began to flourish, with the manager’s decision to move him to a deeper role just in front of the defence allowing his playmaking talents to come to the fore.

Milan won the Champions League and Italian Cup in 2003 with Pirlo pulling the strings, and the team won the Serie A title the following year as he continued to blossom in the ‘regista’ role that has since become synonymous with him.

By the time he won the World Cup, Pirlo was being hailed as the world’s best playmaker and when his form at Milan began to decline, he was offered a move to Juventus.

He enjoyed a renaissance at the Turin club, leading Juventus to the first of the four consecutive Serie A titles he won with them in his debut season, before moving to the United States in July 2015.

Pirlo helped New York City reach the MLS play-offs in each of the past two seasons, but was unable to add to his trophy haul with the club.

“I would like to... thank my family... every team I had the honour to play for, every team mate I have been pleased to play alongside, all the people who made my career so incredible,” he said. “You will always be on my side and in my heart.”",Pirlo bids farewell to football after decades-long career,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-italy-pirlo/pirlo-bids-farewell-to-football-after-decades-long-career-idUKKBN1D627Y

The world’s biggest bike and scooter market with 18 million in the year to last March, India accounts for less than 2 percent of Harley’s global sales but is now a production location for its popular Street 750 bike and a promising generator of growth as U.S. demand slows.

Harley was the first major player in the country’s big bike market - defined as those with engines above 601cc - and controls 60 percent of a segment that has almost tripled in size since 2014 and is expected to double again in the next 4-5 years.

With the arrival of Royal Enfield, however, it faces a locally-owned distribution network that dwarfs Harley’s roughly 30 outlets by a multiple of 24.

Were Enfield to ship even 10 of its new big bikes to each of its about 700 locations, it could double Harley’s 3,700 in annual sales.

A day before the new bike’s launch, Royal Enfield on Monday unveiled a 650cc twin engine, putting it on track to compete squarely with the Street 750.

India-based industry analysts and commentators say that Harley’s distribution network in India must be expanded if it is to deal with the new competition and rising demand from the country’s 1 billion plus consumers.

“Having outlet numbers in the mid twenties is clearly a thin distribution spread,” SBICAP Securities analyst Mahantesh Sabarad said.

“India has over 30 10-million-plus cities and each such city needs 2-3 dealerships to cater to a budding market of bike enthusiasts.”

Asked about the new bike last month, Harley Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told Reuters that he would not dismiss a competitor’s strengths but that he had faith in Harley’s brand and would not be changing strategy.

THIN DISTRIBUTION

Popular enthusiasm for commuting bikes in India’s densely populated city streets provides a far larger rider base than in western markets where Harley sells most of its bikes.

Harley plans to increase its network but is cautious about undermining its premium brand and has had problems with complaints about bike servicing in India in the past.

“The specific plans and the rate at which we (expand) is a function of finding a big enough market area and a really competent dealer that can make the investments to have the brand experience that we want to have for riders,” Levatich said.

“So that’s part of the formula, which will naturally make it probably slower and less dense than most of our competitors will do. But that’s our strategy and we are sticking to it.”

Royal Enfield’s new bike - to be unveiled in Milan on Tuesday - is expected to retail at around rupees 300,000 ($4,640) compared to Harley’s Street 750 at more than 500,000 rupees.

Other Harley executives say they feel confident that it will remain a brand Indians will look up to.

“When it comes to wooing those riders from Royal Enfield to Harley Davidson, we have a track record of that now since we have been in India,” said Marc McAllister, Harley’s managing director for international markets.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

The OPEC member’s socialist leader wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt and has put an alleged drug trafficker in charge of working out how. U.S. sanctions make any refinancing virtually impossible. But even default might not force the hapless, increasingly authoritarian former bus driver from power.

Maduro presides over a mismanaged economy that was hit hard by the end of the oil-price boom in 2014. Now the government cannot provide sufficient food or medicine for its citizens despite huge crude reserves. Nonetheless, on Thursday he said state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela would make a $1.1 billion payment on a bond maturing that day. He also asked Vice President Tareck El Aissami to head a commission studying how to restructure all future obligations. El Aissami called on bondholders to meet in Caracas on Nov. 13 to discuss how that might work.

With great difficulty, is the answer. El Aissami is blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury as an alleged narcotics kingpin, something he denies. Sanctions against Maduro’s government effectively mean U.S. banks can’t take part in any restructuring of the country’s foreign debt, estimated at $90 billion or higher. The country owes some $9 billion in sovereign and PDVSA debt payments in 2018. Reserves have dwindled to barely more than that.

Default might ease some domestic pressure on Maduro by allowing his government to divert scarce dollars to import more medical supplies, food and other basic goods. Yet that may prompt creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments and assets abroad such as PDVSA’s U.S. refiner Citgo.

To counter that, Maduro’s government could try to somehow funnel oil exports through ally Russia, or try to arrange further cash-for-oil barter deals like those it has with Russia and China. It could try to maintain payments on PDVSA debt, protecting the company’s assets, while halting payments on sovereign debt.

Maduro looks increasingly willing to resort to repression. Elections for an all-powerful Constituent Assembly resulted in a rubber-stamp body crammed with government loyalists. Opposition politicians alleged fraud in recent gubernatorial polls but lost heavily and seem unable to unite against him. A presidential vote due next year looks unlikely to be free or fair. Unless dissatisfaction among his own allies in government forces Maduro out, he may end up presiding over a bizarre twilight economy for years to come.",Breakingviews - Venezuela's Maduro enters alternate reality,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-venezuelas-maduro-enters-alternate-reality-idUSKBN1D324G

Mnangagwa’s removal provides a boost for Mugabe’s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.

“The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,” Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.

“It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.”

Mnangagwa’s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.

Grace, 52, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a “coup plotter” and a “coward” on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time.

The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war.

Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations.

FALLEN PROTEGE

The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation.

Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men.

FILE PHOTO: President Robert Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe looks on during a national church interface rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 5, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo

By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980.

However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence.

Mnangagwa’s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF.

Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa’s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

That Mnangagwa’s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship.

Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition.

The subject’s inclusion on the monthly meeting’s agenda of EU finance ministers came after weekend media reports citing the so-called “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents leaked mostly from Appleby, a prominent offshore law firm.

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified them. Appleby was not immediately available for comment.

The latest revelations “put renewed emphasis on the work the European Commission is doing to fight tax avoidance”, the vice president of the EU’s executive arm, Valdis Dombrovskis, told reporters on Monday.

EU countries had planned for months to reach an agreement on a blacklist for tax havens by the end of this year. The new revelations prompted the discussion to be brought forward, EU officials said, but no final decision was expected on Tuesday.

The EU has discussed several measures to crack down on tax avoidance, including in the wake of the “Panama Papers”, a release by the ICIJ last year which chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Measures proposed by the European Commission include an EU-wide list of tax havens meant to discourage the rerouting of profits made in the EU to tax-free or low-tax countries, like Panama or Bermuda.

At the moment, each EU state has its own list of jurisdictions that are seen as less cooperative on tax matters. Criteria to define a tax haven vary greatly among EU states and some of them omit any jurisdictions in their national blacklists.

ONE-COUNTRY LIST?

An EU-wide blacklist is believed to carry more weight. Jurisdictions included in the list could be subject to sanctions if they did not cooperate.

“It’s time that we agree and publish a blacklist on tax havens,” EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters, calling for a “credible” list and “adequate sanctions” when serious breaches are unveiled.

There are no details yet of the type of sanctions that could be imposed, although being on the blacklist in itself could discourage individuals and companies from putting money in those jurisdictions.

Moscovici added that the EU blacklist should be more ambitious than the existing list of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations that has so far been leading the fight against tax avoidance.

The OECD list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax transparency includes to date only Trinidad and Tobago.

Some EU countries remain skeptical about the blacklist and are themselves under scrutiny for unfair tax competition.

Smaller EU states, like Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, attract firms with lower corporate taxes. Some have been sanctioned for deals with multinationals that slashed their tax bills, reducing revenues in other EU states.

To win over their resistance, the proposed EU blacklist would apply only to non-EU countries. Also, states which charge no corporate taxes will not be automatically considered tax havens, under a preliminary deal reached by EU finance ministers last year.

On tax matters the EU can take decisions only with the unanimous backing of its 28 member states, unless extraordinary procedures are launched - an option never tested so far.

To reduce the appeal of tax havens, Brussels has also proposed the setting up of public registries that would show the real owners of companies, which are often hidden by frontmen in shell firms in offshore jurisdictions.

It has also proposed compulsory reporting by large multinational firms of profits made and taxes paid in each state where they operate, in a bid to show how much of their revenues are booked in low-tax countries.

EU states have long been discussing both proposals, but no deal has been reached yet. “EU governments such as Germany have been standing against the rising tide of financial transparency,” said Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International EU.",EU to discuss tax havens blacklist after 'Paradise Papers' leaks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ecofin-taxavoidance/eu-to-discuss-tax-havens-blacklist-after-paradise-papers-leaks-idUSKBN1D618S

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Hong Kong’s Kingboard Chemical Holdings (0148.HK) said it had sold the stake to Qatar Airways for HK$5.16 billion ($661 million), making the Middle Eastern carrier the third-largest shareholder in Cathay.

For Cathay, the Qatar stake will give it a third strategic shareholder behind Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK) and Air China Ltd (601111.SS), potentially complicating a restructuring plan aimed at slashing HK$4 billion in costs over three years.

Without domestic flights to underpin earnings, Asian carriers Cathay and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) have struggled against Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals, with Cathay already shedding 600 jobs since May.

For state-owned Qatar Airways, its first major stake in an Asian airline will allow it to boost its global influence and potentially increase traffic through its Doha hub, amid the worst political crisis in years among the Gulf Arab states.

The airline has been unable to fly to the previously lucrative markets of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of an airspace rights dispute with neighbors, and has been looking to invest elsewhere to broaden its reach.

It was rebuffed by American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) earlier this year.

Despite Cathay’s troubles, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker described it as “one of the strongest airlines in the world ... with massive potential for the future”.

Cathay shares have risen by 29.4 percent since the start of January despite the airline in August posting its worst first-half loss in 20 years.

Shares of Cathay Pacific dropped as much as 4.7 percent on Monday morning, as investors worried about its direction with Qatar Airways on its registry. The stock closed 1.5 percent lower, while the broader market was flat.

“Cathay will have three major shareholders, all with different and potentially conflicting interests - Swire, Air China and Qatar Airways,” said Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.

“This may not necessarily be favorable for Cathay as it is facing operating challenges and undergoing transformation.”

Swire Pacific owns 45 percent of Cathay and Air China 30 percent. Air China said on Monday that it viewed Qatar Airways’ purchase of the Cathay stake “positively” and that it hoped the shareholders could work together to find synergies.

Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said that while Qatar Airways’ investment in Cathay was likely to be passive, difficulties could arise if they tried to better integrate their hubs.

Cathay flew between Hong Kong and Qatar Airway’s Doha hub as part of a codeshare arrangement between 2014 and 2016, when the route was axed “for commercial reasons”.

Qatar Airways’ investment strategy has seen it acquire 20 percent of British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAG.L), 10 percent of South America’s LATAM Airlines Group SA LTM.SN and 49 percent of Italy’s Meridiana.

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal. The Trump administration backed Apple’s view.",Supreme Court rejects Samsung appeal of patent loss to Apple,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D61W4-OCABS

The official IPCA index BRCPI=ECI likely increased 0.47 percent from September, according to the median of 32 economist forecasts that ranged between 0.30 percent and 0.53 percent. The report is scheduled to be published on Friday at 9:00 a.m. local time (1100 GMT).

Food prices are close to stabilizing after falling for months due to a record harvest, helping curb downward pressures on inflation from a slow economic recovery. Meanwhile, scarce rains drove regulators to hike electricity rates in a bid to offset reduced hydropower generation.

An uptick would add evidence to a wider trend, after indices showed producer prices nationwide and prices in Brazil’s largest city of São Paulo accelerating in recent months.

It would also assuage concerns that inflation could end the year below the bank’s target, and could bump up 2018 forecasts, which stand below the 4.5 percent mid-point of the target range.

StarMine’s SmartEstimate, which weighs estimates according to past precision, was slightly above the median forecast for the first time in three months.

Banco J. Safra, the most accurate forecaster of monthly inflation figures in Reuters polls, raised its estimate for 2018 inflation to 4.1 percent from 3.8 percent, due to the outlook for higher-than-expected power tariff hikes.

In a report, Safra economists led by Carlos Kawall wrote that lower-than-average rains in the first quarter of 2018 are likely to force the hand of regulators, driving inflation up by nearly 20 basis points.

That should not prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates to all-time lows in coming months, as it faces subdued wage growth and abundant idle capacity.

A weekly central bank survey of economists put the benchmark Selic interest rate at 7 percent by year-end 2018. The top five most precise estimates, however, suggest the central bank could cut it as low as 6.5 percent in February, after leaving the door open for further reductions.","Brazil inflation likely picks up in October, nears government target",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-inflation/brazil-inflation-likely-picks-up-in-october-nears-government-target-idINKBN1D626A?il=0

If the briefs filed by the petitioner and its most influential allies are any indication, the strategy will likely be to portray this case as a unique one that would warrant a very narrow constitutional exception. But don’t be fooled. If the state of Colorado’s application of its laws is found to be unconstitutional, it would unleash a widespread assault on civil rights protections.

In 2012, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to arrange for a cake to be made for their wedding reception. They were told by Jack Phillips, the store’s owner, that he could not fulfill their order because his religious beliefs prevented him from preparing goods for same-sex wedding ceremonies (although he was otherwise willing to serve LBGT customers). Mullins and Craig sued Masterpiece under Colorado civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations” (businesses or other institutions that are regularly open to the public). Mullins and Craig won: the Colorado Civil Rights Division agreed that Masterpiece had illegally discriminated against them, and its decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Masterpiece appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

It would be natural to assume that this case will be argued on the basis of freedom of religion protections in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has recently given companies broad freedom to ignore laws in deference to the owner’s religious faith. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court held that employers could reject requirements that taxpayer-subsidized employer-provided health insurance cover contraception if doing so would violate the religious beliefs. But while Masterpiece has raised religious freedom objections, the case is unlikely to turn on these grounds. Since the 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment is not violated when a religion-neutral law incidentally burdens an individual’s religious beliefs, as long as that law did not intentionally target religious minorities. Colorado’s application of civil rights law clearly did not violate the free exercise clause based on this precedent, so an argument solely on free religion grounds would be a certain loser.

The Hobby Lobby ruling was based not on the First Amendment but on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute passed in response to Employment Division. Since the 1997 Supreme Court ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, however, RFRA does not apply to state governments. It would therefore be nearly impossible for Masterpiece to prevail on a religious freedom claim.

Backed up by a brief from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, Masterpiece will almost certainly focus on another part of the First Amendment: the free speech clause. The shop is arguing that, given the artistry involved in creating a custom wedding cake, compelling it to create a cake for a ceremony it morally disapproves of would violate its rights to freedom of speech and expression.

Creating religious exceptions to generally applicable laws would make civil rights statutes very difficult to enforce, since discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation can all be defended on religious grounds. If applied logically, a religious exemption would quickly mean that civil rights laws exist only at the pleasure of the employer.

Recognizing this liability in a free expression argument, Masterpiece will likely claim that a free expression exemption applies only in the very narrow context of a mom-and-pop bakery being asked to make something for a particular ceremony. Most employees of most companies, they will argue, are not engaged in activity that is similarly expressive.

But as the libertarian legal scholars Dale Carpenter and Eugene Volokh argue in their persuasive amicus brief on behalf of Colorado, if Masterpiece’s free speech claim were accepted by the Court, it would “apply to a vast range of conduct.” Many of the activities employees and their supervisors engage in on the job have elements as potentially “expressive” as baking a cake, and this is true of both tiny storefronts and Fortune 500 corporations. “[Restaurant chain] Subway calls its sandwich-makers ‘sandwich artists,’” Carpenter and Volokh observe, “[b]ut a restaurant may not refuse to cook or prepare a table for certain customers on the ground that it would be a free speech compulsion.” Similarly, a florist who didn’t want to participate in a same-sex wedding could declare themselves “floral artists,” hotel receptionists could declare themselves “phone answering artists,” and so on.

It is unclear about where the line would end up being drawn should the Court accept Masterpiece’s free speech argument. But even if it ended up being fairly narrow, it would still require extensive litigation to find out. And it’s likely that in practice the exceptions would not be narrow at all. The wise approach for the Supreme Court would be to follow the lead of the Colorado court and uphold the sound judgement of the state’s civil rights commission: that while Jack Phillips is entitled to his beliefs, when he opens a business to the public he is required to follow state laws and treat his customers equally.

It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition’s announcement.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

Dudley, 64, one of the central bank’s strongest advocates of unprecedented monetary stimulus in the last decade and a steady hand on its delicate market operations, will step down before his term officially ends in January 2019.

The New York Fed’s board said its search committee seeks a “broad, diverse” pool of candidates and aims to name a successor by the middle of next year. A source familiar with the effort said the search had already begun with preliminary calls for advice on what attributes might be sought in candidates and possible names.

The announcement, which Reuters reported on Sunday, accelerates a revolution in Fed leadership that could upend its cautious approach to raising interest rates and to shedding some of the $3.5-trillion in bonds that were purchased to stimulate the economy in the face of the 2007-2009 crisis and recession.

Trump, a Republican who seeks to pare down the central bank’s tough financial regulations while keeping interest rates moderately low, on Thursday named Fed Governor Jerome Powell as successor to Janet Yellen when her term ends in February. This decision broke a precedent of Fed chairs serving at least two terms.

The White House has an unusually large window to reshape the Fed given three more seats are vacant on its powerful seven-seat Board of Governors, and four if Yellen retires next year. The Fed’s well respected vice chair, Stanley Fischer, and its point-person on bank supervision, Daniel Tarullo, stepped down earlier this year as the overhaul gained steam in the wake of the 2016 U.S. election.

“It clears the deck for a Powell-led Fed,” said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. The New York Fed president’s “bully pulpit is an important one” on both monetary and regulatory policy, he said, adding Trump’s selection of Powell and not a more reform-minded nominee for Fed chair may have allowed Dudley to retire early.

CRISIS-ERA TENURE

Trump pick Randal Quarles assumed a board position last month as the Fed’s vice chair for financial supervision. The 12 regional Fed presidents are chosen by their regional directors, though they are approved by the Fed Board in Washington and they vote on policy on a rotating basis.

The New York Fed president is unique in that the position has a permanent vote on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), serves as its vice chair, and acts as its eyes and ears on Wall Street and often as its liaison to international counterparts.

In a statement, Yellen said Dudley made “enormous contributions” to Fed policy and helped leave the “American economy stronger and the financial system safer.” Dudley called it a “dream job” focused on public policy and service.

A former Goldman Sachs chief economist, he joined the New York Fed as its markets head in 2007 and in the depths of the crisis took its helm in early 2009. He has since steered a mostly dovish path as a close ally of Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke, often flagging pending policy changes that influenced world financial markets.

In recent months Dudley has advocated a more aggressive tightening path even while inflation has drifted lower below target, an argument he may advance in a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of New York on Monday.

As bank watchdog, he has repeatedly criticized poor culture among bankers and behavior that lead for example to the manipulation of the Libor reference rate. Yet Dudley himself has faced criticism from Congress and others, including for the New York Fed’s failure to stem JPMorgan’s risky so-called London Whale trades in 2012.

NATIONWIDE SEARCH

As its New York chief, Dudley oversaw the Fed’s mass asset purchases and its decision to start shrinking the balance sheet last month. Indeed financial conditions - including credit spreads, the dollar, stocks and bonds - have played an outsized role in his recommendations even while he has urged policies to drive U.S. unemployment as low as practicable.

The central bank’s tricky task of edging away from bond markets suggests that Simon Potter, the current head of market operations at the New York Fed; Lorie Logan, the bank’s head of analysis and monitoring of market operations; and Brian Sack, who held the role before Potter and is now at D.E. Shaw, could be considered candidates.

The search committee could also look to current and former Fed governors and presidents, according to former Fed officials and those familiar with past search efforts in New York and elsewhere within the central bank. Fed Governor Lael Brainard and former governor Kevin Warsh, whom Trump considered for the Fed chair job, could also be in the mix, they said.

The chair of New York Fed’s board, Freelancers Union founder Sara Horowitz, will co-head the search committee with director Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of private-equity firm Silver Lake. It hired firms Spencer Stuart and Bridge Partners for the nationwide search that will tap “academia, community and economic development organizations, labor, small business and industry” for advice, the board said.",Dudley's exit hangs another question over Fed leadership,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-dudley/dudleys-exit-hangs-another-question-over-fed-leadership-idUSKBN1D61MH

FILE PHOTO: Labourers work at the installation site of a new railway track on the outskirts of Agartala, India, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jayanta Dey/File Photo

India’s Ministry of Railways, which manages the world’s fourth-largest rail network, has grappled with a spate of accidents. Modi’s government wants to overhaul the country’s aging tracks, but shortages of steel produced by state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) have slowed progress.

The clash highlights the dilemma the government faces as it tries to promote local production through the “Make in India” campaign at the same time it faces resistance from some state buyers who need to procure goods as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Indian Railways issued a tender seeking 717,000 tonnes of steel rails on Oct. 18, which was the first time the state-run railroad operator sought overseas rails. The tender could be worth an estimated 30 billion rupees ($464 million) for global steel majors such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp.

That amount will make up SAIL’s shortfall for the next two financial years.

For the financial year for 2017/18, SAIL is expected to supply 920,000 tonnes, only 65 percent of the target, according to a letter sent by Indian Railways to the Steel Ministry dated Oct. 18 and reviewed by Reuters.

In 2018/19, SAIL is expected to supply 1.3 million tonnes, falling short of 1.5 million tonnes sought by the railways, the letter showed.

“We require rails. SAIL is not able to deliver the rails. That’s it,” said Ashwani Lohani, the chairman of the Railway Board which manages Indian Railways for the Ministry of Railways.

He said Indian Railways had “no intention to change the tender”, which is the first time the company ever sought overseas rails.

SAIL did not respond to requests for comment.

India’s Ministry of Steel urged Indian Railways not to violate the “Make in India” policy that requires all infrastructure projects worth more than 500 million rupees to use locally-made steel.

In a meeting on Friday, Steel Ministry officials asked the railways to abide by procurement rules that require steel for major infrastructure projects to come from domestic producers, three people who attended the meeting said.

EXEMPTION SOUGHT

Indian Railways maintains that passenger safety justifies an exemption to the “Make in India” policy. The government could allow an exception if there are shortages or specific grades of steel are unavailable.

In a letter to Lohani from Aruna Sharma, the secretary at the Steel Ministry, dated Oct. 23 and reviewed by Reuters, the ministry urged the railways “to follow the procedure” on steel procurement, but said it would examine the need for a waiver.

In September, Modi named a new railways minister to oversee a $130 billion, five-year modernization program and to replace some of the 92,000 km of tracks operated by Indian Railways.

The railways are a lifeline for the more than 20 million mostly poorer people who use it every day. In February, the government launched a $15 billion fund dedicated to ending the rising number of train accidents caused by track defects.

India’s state-owned companies such as SAIL maintain large roles in key industries and infrastructure projects, despite struggling with inefficiencies.

Reuters has previously reported that the railways this year considered ending SAIL’s decades-long monopoly supplying steel.

Private firm Jindal Steel and Power, the only domestic alternative, pitched its services at the Friday meeting, the three people attending said, but railway officials raised concerns that it lacks experience building rails.

Dudley, 64, one of the central bank’s strongest advocates of unprecedented monetary stimulus in the last decade and a steady hand on its delicate market operations, will step down before his term officially ends in January 2019.

The New York Fed’s board said its search committee seeks a “broad, diverse” pool of candidates and aims to name a successor by the middle of next year. A source familiar with the effort said the search had already begun with preliminary calls for advice on what attributes might be sought in candidates and possible names.

The announcement, which Reuters reported on Sunday, accelerates a revolution in Fed leadership that could upend its cautious approach to raising interest rates and to shedding some of the $3.5-trillion in bonds that were purchased to stimulate the economy in the face of the 2007-2009 crisis and recession.

Trump, a Republican who seeks to pare down the central bank’s tough financial regulations while keeping interest rates moderately low, on Thursday named Fed Governor Jerome Powell as successor to Janet Yellen when her term ends in February. This decision broke a precedent of Fed chairs serving at least two terms.

The White House has an unusually large window to reshape the Fed given three more seats are vacant on its powerful seven-seat Board of Governors, and four if Yellen retires next year. The Fed’s well respected vice chair, Stanley Fischer, and its point-person on bank supervision, Daniel Tarullo, stepped down earlier this year as the overhaul gained steam in the wake of the 2016 U.S. election.

“It clears the deck for a Powell-led Fed,” said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. The New York Fed president’s “bully pulpit is an important one” on both monetary and regulatory policy, he said, adding Trump’s selection of Powell and not a more reform-minded nominee for Fed chair may have allowed Dudley to retire early.

CRISIS-ERA TENURE

Trump pick Randal Quarles assumed a board position last month as the Fed’s vice chair for financial supervision. The 12 regional Fed presidents are chosen by their regional directors, though they are approved by the Fed Board in Washington and they vote on policy on a rotating basis.

The New York Fed president is unique in that the position has a permanent vote on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), serves as its vice chair, and acts as its eyes and ears on Wall Street and often as its liaison to international counterparts.

In a statement, Yellen said Dudley made “enormous contributions” to Fed policy and helped leave the “American economy stronger and the financial system safer.” Dudley called it a “dream job” focused on public policy and service.

A former Goldman Sachs chief economist, he joined the New York Fed as its markets head in 2007 and in the depths of the crisis took its helm in early 2009. He has since steered a mostly dovish path as a close ally of Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke, often flagging pending policy changes that influenced world financial markets.

In recent months Dudley has advocated a more aggressive tightening path even while inflation has drifted lower below target, an argument he may advance in a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of New York on Monday.

As bank watchdog, he has repeatedly criticized poor culture among bankers and behavior that lead for example to the manipulation of the Libor reference rate. Yet Dudley himself has faced criticism from Congress and others, including for the New York Fed’s failure to stem JPMorgan’s risky so-called London Whale trades in 2012.

NATIONWIDE SEARCH

As its New York chief, Dudley oversaw the Fed’s mass asset purchases and its decision to start shrinking the balance sheet last month. Indeed financial conditions - including credit spreads, the dollar, stocks and bonds - have played an outsized role in his recommendations even while he has urged policies to drive U.S. unemployment as low as practicable.

The central bank’s tricky task of edging away from bond markets suggests that Simon Potter, the current head of market operations at the New York Fed; Lorie Logan, the bank’s head of analysis and monitoring of market operations; and Brian Sack, who held the role before Potter and is now at D.E. Shaw, could be considered candidates.

The search committee could also look to current and former Fed governors and presidents, according to former Fed officials and those familiar with past search efforts in New York and elsewhere within the central bank. Fed Governor Lael Brainard and former governor Kevin Warsh, whom Trump considered for the Fed chair job, could also be in the mix, they said.

The chair of New York Fed’s board, Freelancers Union founder Sara Horowitz, will co-head the search committee with director Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of private-equity firm Silver Lake. It hired firms Spencer Stuart and Bridge Partners for the nationwide search that will tap “academia, community and economic development organizations, labor, small business and industry” for advice, the board said.",Dudley's exit hangs another question over Fed leadership,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-dudley/dudleys-exit-hangs-another-question-over-fed-leadership-idINKBN1D61MH?il=0

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

An autopsy will determine the cause of death, Martin said.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said in an interview that the family members had not been present at the time of Kelley’s attack

“I heard that (the in-laws) attended church from time to time,” Tackitt said. “Not on a regular basis.”

The attack, which killed people ranging from 18 months to 77 years old, came a little more than a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a sole gunman in U.S. history.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012. Those attacks now stand as the fourth deadliest by a single gunman in the United States.

Officials warned that 10 of the wounded remained in critical condition on Monday morning.","Texas church gunman sent threatening texts to in-laws, officials say",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting/several-people-shot-at-texas-church-witnesses-tell-cbs-affiliate-idUSKBN1D510F

Auch zwei Ereignisse vom Donnerstag hallten noch nach und sorgten für positive Stimmung: die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von Janet Yellen an die Spitze der US-Notenbank und die Vorlage der mehrfach aufgeschobenen Steuer-Pläne der Republikaner um Präsident Donald Trump.

Der Dow-Jones-Index der Standardwerte schloss 0,1 Prozent höher auf 23.539 Punkten. Der breiter gefasste S&P-500 rückte um 0,3 Prozent auf 2587 Zähler vor. Der Index der Technologiebörse Nasdaq verbesserte sich um 0,7 Prozent auf 6764 Punkte.

Die US-Wirtschaft baute im Oktober kräftig Stellen auf. Insgesamt entstanden neue 261.000 Jobs, was allerdings unter den Erwartungen lag. Die Entwicklung steht aber im Kontrast zum September, als wegen der Hurrikans “Harvey” und “Irma” nur 18.000 Jobs entstanden. Damit ist die Bühne für die dritte geldpolitische Straffung 2017 bereitet: Händler sehen die Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Dezember-Erhöhung bei 90 Prozent. Zuletzt hatte die Fed den Zins im Juni auf 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent hochgesetzt.

Im Technologiesektor steckten der Hype um den Verkaufsstart des iPhone X und ein rosiger Ausblick auf das Weihnachtsgeschäft von Apple die Anleger an. Die Apple-Aktie legte um 2,6 Prozent zu.

Gegen die Markttendenz brachen Aktien von AIG 4,6 Prozent ein. Die Serie von Wirbelstürmen in den USA und der Karibik trieb den Versicherer in die roten Zahlen. Der Konzern wies für das dritte Quartal einen Nettoverlust von 1,74 Milliarden Dollar aus, nachdem ein Jahr zuvor noch ein Gewinn von 462 Millionen Dollar in den Büchern stand.

Gut kam bei Investoren die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von US-Notenbankchefin Janet Yellen an. Der 64-Jährige steht für Kontinuität in der Geldpolitik. “Mit ihm dürfte der von der Fed eingeschlagene Kurs gradueller Leitzinsanhebungen fortgesetzt werden”, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank.

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal.

The latest row over Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern Himalayas that China claims as southern Tibet suggests the neighbours remain far apart, despite recent attempts to defuse tension.

On Sunday, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took stock of defence preparedness in Arunachal Pradesh along the Line of Actual Control, the de facto, but disputed, border between the two countries.

Sitharaman also tweeted pictures of her visit, including her meeting with Indian army officers.

China lashed back on Monday.

“An Indian official going to a disputed region on the China- India border will perhaps make the issue even more complex, and is not beneficial to efforts by both parties to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, New Delhi has reacted strongly to any attempts challenging its sovereignty over Arunachal.

China and India have tried to develop two-ways ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute.

In April, China slammed India’s decision to host Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the region, saying it could cause serious damage to relations.

FILE PHOTO: Deutsche Telekom logo is seen during preparations at the CeBit computer fair, which will open its doors to the public on March 20, at the fairground in Hanover, Germany, March 19, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo

The evaporation of synergies that analysts had estimated at more than Sprint’s $27 billion market capitalization triggered several broker downgrades and sent Telekom’s stock as much as 3.6 percent lower.

But some praised Telekom for exercising discipline in not agreeing to pay a significant premium for heavily-indebted Sprint and insisting on control that would have allowed it to consolidate the merged entity into its results.

Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said T-Mobile, in which the German company owns a 64 percent stake, would press ahead with a strategy that has added more than a million customers for 18 consecutive quarters.

“Frankly, T-Mobile US is well enough positioned to succeed on its own without Sprint,” said Dhananjay Mirchandani, a telecoms analyst at Bernstein Research in London.

“As for Deutsche Telekom, after the shares take a near term knock, I don’t see how this really alters strategy,” Mirchandani added. “So back to boring business-as-usual.”

The slide in Telekom shares was similar to the Tokyo market falls for Sprint, majority owner Softbank Group, whose boss Masayoshi Son, sources said, had got cold feet over ceding control.

SoftBank said on Sunday it would raise its stake in Sprint to under 85 percent from 83 percent in a show of commitment to the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier which, while managing to grow its customer base, is weighed down with $38 billion of debt.

T-Mobile’s importance as a driver of growth - which could have been enhanced by the Sprint deal - is likely to be underscored when Deutsche Telekom reports results this week. T-Mobile has already reported third-quarter revenues that topped $10 billion for the first time, up 8 percent.

The picture for Deutsche Telekom group on Thursday is likely to be different, with analysts on average forecasting group revenues of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion) - a year-on-year gain of just 1.6 percent.

That would reflect barely positive growth in Telekom’s crowded and heavily regulated home market, where sales rose just 0.4 percent in the first half, and at its European holdings that were ahead by 1.5 percent.

Analysts at Berenberg bank said Deutsche Telekom management deserved some credit for not doing the deal for its own sake. Still, they lowered their share-price target to 14 euros from 15.80 and restated their ‘hold’ rating on the stock.

Some investors wonder whether the best years may now be behind T-Mobile, whose shares have risen nine-fold from the low they hit after the global financial crisis to a peak of $68 in June.

“I’d just love them to sell it,” Ben Lofthouse, a fund manager at the Henderson International Income Trust, said last week as reports surfaced that the T-Mobile-Sprint talks were in trouble.

At T-Mobile’s latest share price, Deutsche Telekom’s 64 percent stake would be worth $31 billion.

“There’s a tendency to run things for ever, sometimes, and then you end up selling at the wrong times,” added Lofthouse, whose fund holds Deutsche Telekom shares.

Together, T-Mobile and Sprint would have had about 130 million customers, putting a merged entity a close third in the United States behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon. Alone, T-Mobile has 70.7 million customers.","Failure of U.S. deal hits Deutsche Telekom shares, growth prospects",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us-deutsche/failure-of-u-s-deal-hits-deutsche-telekom-shares-growth-prospects-idUSKBN1D60YA

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

Addyi, the controversial pink pill made by Sprout, was touted as a possible blockbuster drug that would command much of what analysts had said could be a $2 billion market.

But sales of the pill has been sluggish and last year Valeant was sued on behalf of former Sprout investors over its alleged failure to market Addyi successfully.

The complaint had said that sales of the pill may have totaled less than $10 million in 2016, far short of the $1 billion targeted by July, 2017.

Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2015 under intense pressure from patient advocacy groups, Addyi is meant to activate sexual impulses in the brain and is taken daily.

But it carries a strong warning about potentially dangerous low blood pressure and fainting, especially when taken with alcohol.

Valeant said on Monday it would get 6 percent royalty on global sales of Addyi beginning 18 months from the signing of the deal, which is expected to close before the end of the year.

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters. “The mother-in-law attended the church. We know he sent threatening ... that she had received threatening text messages from him.”

The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his wife and child and sentenced to 12 months confinement. He received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to Ann Stefanek, the chief of Air Force media operations.

Kelley, 26, walked into the white-steepled First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs on Sunday carrying a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle and wearing a black bulletproof vest, then opened fire during prayer service. He wounded at least 20 others, officials said.

After he left the church, two local residents, including one who was armed, chased Kelley in a truck and they exchanged gunfire. The chase ended when Kelley crashed his car, and may have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from the Good Samaritan’s weapon, said Martin.

The initial death toll matched the fatalities at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a man shot and killed 26 children and educators and his mother before taking his own life in December 2012.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

The meetings were a potential breach of ministerial protocol.

Patel said she met with senior Israeli figures, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Foreign Ministry’ Director General Yuval Rotem and opposition leader Yair Lapid.

She apologized for failing to follow the usual procedures that ministers inform Britain’s Foreign Office before conducting official business overseas and said she regretted suggesting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had been aware of her trip.

“I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be mis-read, and how meetings were set up and reported,” Patel said in a statement. “I am sorry for this and I apologize for it.”

Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is already under the microscope over the fallout from a broader parliamentary sexual harassment scandal which last week forced Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign.

May’s most senior minister Damian Green is also under investigation from Britain’s Cabinet Office after claims by a former senior police officer that pornography was found on one of his work computers and that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman. He denies any wrongdoing.

Other political parties are also under scrutiny.

Labour’s spokeswoman for international development Kate Osamor said that Patel should resign or face an investigation by the Cabinet Office for breach of the ministerial code.

A government spokesman said May accepted Patel’s apology and met with her on Monday to remind her of the obligations under the ministerial code.

After details of Patel’s meetings in Israel were first reported last week, Patel told the Guardian newspaper Johnson “knew about the trip.”

In a clarification on Monday she said that “this was not the case” and that he “did become aware of the visit, but not in advance of it”.

Patel said she “regrets the lack of precision in the wording she used in these statements, and is taking the opportunity to clarify the position.”

The White House says Trump’s trip is intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over his hard-line approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats, but many in the region fear that further bellicose presidential rhetoric could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict on the Korean peninsula.

Arriving in South Korea on the second stop of a five-country trek, Trump will tour the main garrison for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the sprawling Camp Humphreys, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea.

Trump is seeking to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang following a visit to Tokyo, where he said on Monday that America was working to counter North Korea’s “dangerous aggressions” and talked about Japan being able to shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” once it completes purchases of U.S. military equipment.

The South Korea visit also aims to shore up an uneasy alliance between Washington and Seoul, which has come under U.S. pressure over trade and defense spending.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States, for deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and for dismissing as pointless any diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

Kim, who has also made clear he has little interest in negotiations, at least until North Korea develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, has called Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s 12-day visit to the region. U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

U.S. Marines and South Korean forces will be conducting previously planned joint military drills in the northwestern part of South Korea during Trump’s visit, South Korea’s defense ministry said on Monday, an action that could further aggravate tension with Pyongyang.

Defending his tough talk against North Korea, Trump said in Tokyo: ”Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.”

SEOUL WARY OF PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO JAPAN

U.S. ally South Korea, meanwhile, is rolling out the red carpet for Trump but is also sensitive to the fact that he plans to spend only 24 hours in the country compared to 48 hours in Japan, the kind of comparison that South Koreans often make because of concerns they are a lesser U.S. priority than Tokyo, its richer neighbor.

While Trump has forged a strong bond with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as well as Chinese President Xi Jinping – who will host him later this week – South Korean officials say there has been less personal chemistry between him and their new liberal president, Moon Jae-in.

During the state visit, South Koreans are also bracing for the possibility that Trump will renew his criticism of Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – and will again threaten to pull out of a free trade pact between the two countries.

Trump has accused South Korea in the past of not paying its fair share for the cost of U.S. forces in the country. A South Korean presidential official said that Trump’s visit to Camp Humphreys would be a chance to inform him that Seoul paid more than 90 percent of some $10 billion in land and construction costs for the base.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

Trump will steer clear of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) zone on the border between the two Koreas - where other U.S. presidents have visited - a move that might have been seen by North Korea as more of a provocation.

But the base visit will give him a first-hand view not only of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea but also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

Trump will also have talks on Tuesday with Moon at South Korea’s presidential Blue House, hold a joint news conference and attend a state dinner with traditional music and K-pop performances. He will wrap up his visit on Wednesday with an address to the National Assembly.",Trump's Seoul visit to put him at heart of North Korea nuclear standoff,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-southkorea/trumps-seoul-visit-to-put-him-at-heart-of-north-korea-nuclear-standoff-idUSKBN1D61YG

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat.

Prince Mohammed’s reforms include a plan to list parts of giant state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco next year, with higher oil prices seen as beneficial for the market capitalization of the future listed company.

The news spurred concerns of Middle Eastern money pulling out of global financial markets. A weekend call by China’s central bank governor for tougher financial regulation also hit global investor sentiment.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.2 percent higher. Saudi Arabia’s own stock market fell as much as 1.5 percent before ending 0.1 percent higher, boosted in part by buying by government-linked funds.

Sentiment towards the U.S. dollar was still positive with leveraged funds paring bearish bets to be net long for the first time since late July.

“There is some ongoing adjustment in market expectations on the dollar’s outlook on the progress of the U.S. tax bill and on the ongoing Saudi situation but market moves have been in narrow ranges,” said Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments in London.

The White House says Trump’s trip is intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over his hard-line approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats, but many in the region fear that further bellicose presidential rhetoric could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict on the Korean peninsula.

Arriving in South Korea on the second stop of a five-country trek, Trump will tour the main garrison for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the sprawling Camp Humphreys, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea.

Trump is seeking to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang following a visit to Tokyo, where he said on Monday that America was working to counter North Korea’s “dangerous aggressions” and talked about Japan being able to shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” once it completes purchases of U.S. military equipment.

The South Korea visit also aims to shore up an uneasy alliance between Washington and Seoul, which has come under U.S. pressure over trade and defense spending.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States, for deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and for dismissing as pointless any diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

Kim, who has also made clear he has little interest in negotiations, at least until North Korea develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, has called Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s 12-day visit to the region. U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

U.S. Marines and South Korean forces will be conducting previously planned joint military drills in the northwestern part of South Korea during Trump’s visit, South Korea’s defense ministry said on Monday, an action that could further aggravate tension with Pyongyang.

Defending his tough talk against North Korea, Trump said in Tokyo: ”Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.”

SEOUL WARY OF PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO JAPAN

U.S. ally South Korea, meanwhile, is rolling out the red carpet for Trump but is also sensitive to the fact that he plans to spend only 24 hours in the country compared to 48 hours in Japan, the kind of comparison that South Koreans often make because of concerns they are a lesser U.S. priority than Tokyo, its richer neighbor.

Slideshow (8 Images)

While Trump has forged a strong bond with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as well as Chinese President Xi Jinping – who will host him later this week – South Korean officials say there has been less personal chemistry between him and their new liberal president, Moon Jae-in.

During the state visit, South Koreans are also bracing for the possibility that Trump will renew his criticism of Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – and will again threaten to pull out of a free trade pact between the two countries.

Trump has accused South Korea in the past of not paying its fair share for the cost of U.S. forces in the country. A South Korean presidential official said that Trump’s visit to Camp Humphreys would be a chance to inform him that Seoul paid more than 90 percent of some $10 billion in land and construction costs for the base.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

Trump will steer clear of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) zone on the border between the two Koreas - where other U.S. presidents have visited - a move that might have been seen by North Korea as more of a provocation.

But the base visit will give him a first-hand view not only of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea but also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

Trump will also have talks on Tuesday with Moon at South Korea’s presidential Blue House, hold a joint news conference and attend a state dinner with traditional music and K-pop performances. He will wrap up his visit on Wednesday with an address to the National Assembly.",Trump's Seoul visit to put him at heart of North Korea nuclear standoff,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D61ZR

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition’s announcement.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

The meetings were a potential breach of ministerial protocol.

Patel said she met with senior Israeli figures, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Foreign Ministry’ Director General Yuval Rotem and opposition leader Yair Lapid.

She apologized for failing to follow the usual procedures that ministers inform Britain’s Foreign Office before conducting official business overseas and said she regretted suggesting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had been aware of her trip.

“I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be mis-read, and how meetings were set up and reported,” Patel said in a statement. “I am sorry for this and I apologize for it.”

Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is already under the microscope over the fallout from a broader parliamentary sexual harassment scandal which last week forced Britain’s defense minister Michael Fallon to resign.

May’s most senior minister Damian Green is also under investigation from Britain’s Cabinet Office after claims by a former senior police officer that pornography was found on one of his work computers and that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman. He denies any wrongdoing.

Other political parties are also under scrutiny.

Labour’s spokeswoman for international development Kate Osamor said that Patel should resign or face an investigation by the Cabinet Office for breach of the ministerial code.

A government spokesman said May accepted Patel’s apology and met with her on Monday to remind her of the obligations under the ministerial code.

After details of Patel’s meetings in Israel were first reported last week, Patel told the Guardian newspaper Johnson “knew about the trip.”

In a clarification on Monday she said that “this was not the case” and that he “did become aware of the visit, but not in advance of it”.

Patel said she “regrets the lack of precision in the wording she used in these statements, and is taking the opportunity to clarify the position.”

Having already bought 2.2 trillion euros worth of bonds to depress borrowing costs, the ECB has started to shift its focus from new purchases, arguing that its bloated balance sheet will provide the bulk of accommodation needed to lift inflation.

New buys will be cut in half to 30 billion euros a month from January and markets expect the ECB to end purchases by the end of the year. One reason is that finding enough bonds is becoming increasingly difficult within the legal parameters of the program, commonly known as quantitative easing.

October data released on Monday showed that purchases remained skewed towards countries such as France and Italy, with the ECB deviating from the so-called capital key, a rule that requires purchases in line with the size of each country’s economy.

Bond buys in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, were about 300 million euros below the capital key. They also trailed in Portugal and dropped to zero in Ireland, where the ECB already has sizable bond holdings.

The ECB’s problem is that it cannot hold more than a third of each country’s debt, so once it reaches a the limit, it needs to redistribute purchases among countries with bigger bond markets, facing accusations that it is de facto rewarding more indebted countries.

SMALLER THAN EXPECTED

Redemptions, disclosed for the first time on Monday, will average 10.8 billion euros a month in the 12 months from November, below analyst expectations for around 15 billion euros, with big fluctuations expected between months, the data released for the first time showed.

Redemptions will peak in April, when they hit 24.3 billion euros. The lowest monthly total will be in August, when they drop to 2 billion euros, the figures showed.

The vast majority of redemptions -- 101.5 billion euros -- will be in the public-sector purchase program, which is dominated by government bonds. Eighteen billion euros worth of covered bonds and seven billion euros of asset-backed securities are also due to mature.

Cash maturing from government bonds will be reinvested within two months in the same country as the original bond, if market conditions allow, the ECB said earlier. The re-investments are due to continue for an extended period after new buys end.

ECB data also showed that redemptions have been relatively minor this autumn with the public-sector maturities totaling 22.7 billion euros until the end of October.

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

Donna Brazile has written in a soon-to-be-published book that she thought about working to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after the nominee almost collapsed at an event on Sept. 11, 2016.

In an interview on Sunday with ABC’s “This Week,” Brazile said she had supported Clinton but felt under pressure to come up with a “Plan B” after the candidate collapsed and many people were calling the DNC to ask about the incident.

“I wanted her to win, but we were under pressure,” Brazile said. “For those who are telling me to shut up ... you know what I tell them? Go to hell. I‘m going to tell my story.”

Her book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that put Donald Trump in the White House,” is set for release on Tuesday by Hachette Books.

About 100 former Clinton campaign staffers have signed an open letter saying they were shocked to learn in Brazile’s upcoming book that she considered trying to replace both Clinton and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine.

Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016.

She nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Her doctor said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, and she took several days off from campaigning.

Brazile’s comments on ABC revealed tensions with Clinton’s campaign staff. ”I got sick and tired of people trying to tell me how to spend money,“ she said. ” ... I wasn’t getting a salary. I was basically volunteering my time.

“I‘m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile said, referring to a character in the film “12 Years a Slave.”

But Brazile said she had found no evidence that the Democratic primaries were rigged, a comment at odds with an article she wrote in Politico this week saying the process had been fixed in favor of Clinton, who had signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.
But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

TRADE DEFICITS

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

EMPEROR, ABDUCTEES

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

In New York, the Crew enjoyed a seemingly comfortable 4-1 advantage going into the second leg at Yankee Stadium but the home side took a 2-0 lead with a first-half David Villa penalty and a 53rd-minute Andraz Struna strike.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Within hours of the U.S. announcement on Oct. 8, Turkey said it was implementing reciprocal measures and President Tayyip Erdogan later angrily accused Washington of sacrificing a longstanding alliance with Ankara.

“The U.S. Mission in Turkey has resumed processing visas on a limited basis,” the embassy said in an email seen by Reuters on Monday, adding that appointments would be limited and could lead to long waiting times.

A U.S. embassy worker in Ankara confirmed the decision to Reuters. The lira firmed to 3.8356 at 1533 GMT, from 3.8708 beforehand.

“The decision came right before PM Yildirim’s visit to the U.S., showing that Turkey-US agreed on a mutual solution regarding the visa service crisis,” Ozgur Altug, chief economist at brokerage BGC Partners, said in a note.

The gains in the lira, which was also boosted by central bank measures on dollar liquidity earlier on Monday, helped push Istanbul's main BIST stock index .XU100 up 2.58 percent on Monday to close at a record high of 114.165,67 points.

In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and, more recently, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year’ failed coup. The U.S. Embassy has said the accusations are baseless.

Turkish police want to question a third worker based in Istanbul. His wife and daughter were detained over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the abortive putsch. They were later released.

Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition.

Gulen denies any involvement in the failed coup.

Turkey has also been enraged by Washington’s support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).",U.S. embassy in Turkey resuming visa issuing on 'limited basis',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-visa/u-s-embassy-in-turkey-resuming-visa-issuing-on-limited-basis-idUSKBN1D61VQ?il=0

The appointment of the 36-year old Franco-Moroccan writer as emissary for Francophone affairs follows Macron’s decision to name a TV presenter and well-known ecologist as environment minister and an Olympic fencer as sports minister, opening up government to civil society.

Slimani was propelled into the limelight when she won the prestigious Prix Goncourt last year for her novel “Chanson Douce”, which translates as lullaby. This year, she published a book about sexuality in Morocco.

The size of the purge - 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers were detained by a newly created anti-corruption committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - raised questions about the stability and predictability of the Saudi government.

For foreigners, a major shock was the detention of flamboyant billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who as a big investor in top Western companies such as Citigroup is known as the international face of Saudi business.

Local investors, meanwhile, worried about whether a sustained investigation into corruption could turn up scandals in the kingdom’s opaque business world, forcing people implicated to sell off their equity holdings.

But many bankers and analysts saw the purge, which replaced the head of the National Guard, as a power grab by Prince Mohammed, designed to remove any remaining obstacles to his authority and assure his eventual succession to the throne.

This, they said, could help the economy by making it easier for Prince Mohammed to pursue radical reforms that include slashing the state budget deficit, putting more women into employment, lifting a ban on women driving, and selling $300 billion of state assets.

“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at emerging markets investment bank Exotix.

”As unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralisation might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda, the benefits of which very few investors are pricing in.”

After initially tumbling as much as 2.2 percent on Sunday, the Saudi stock index rebounded to close slightly higher. Shares related to some of the detained people, such as Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding, sank but most banks rose, a sign of economic optimism.

INSTABILITY

The purge may increase Prince Mohammed’s grassroots support by tackling corruption, a problem that has long plagued the economy.

“It’s a populist move that makes sense because a lot of the princes, businessmen and bureaucrats are corrupt, taking kickbacks and being involved in all kinds of shady deals,” said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East studies at Princeton University.

A danger for financial markets, however, is that Prince Mohammed is shaking up business practices and ties that have lasted for decades, a move which could backfire if it triggers an exodus of money and wealthy individuals from the country.

“The fact that some of the country’s leading business people were arrested will scare the private sector and there might be even more capital flight than before. And most bureaucrats will now be terrified, perhaps justifiably,” Haykel said.

Many corporate executives expect Prince Mohammed to persuade or pressure rich Saudis to repatriate some of the billions of dollars which they are believed to have transferred overseas for safe-keeping, and which could now help to kick-start the development projects that he plans.

The corruption crackdown may be an initial step in this effort; the decree creating the committee gave it the right, pending the result of investigations, to seize assets at home or abroad and transfer them to the state Treasury.

James Dorsey, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, wrote that Prince Mohammed appeared to be reacting to growing opposition within the royal family and the military to his reforms and Riyadh’s military intervention in Yemen.

“It raises questions about the reform process that increasingly is based on a unilateral rather than a consensual rewriting of the kingdom’s social contract.”

For many people, however, a unilateral approach is seen as the best chance to push through the reforms. A chief economist at a big regional bank said Prince Mohammed’s main motive for acting was frustration that reforms were not moving fast enough.

The privatisation programme, for example, including the planned sale of 5 percent of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, has been discussed for many months with little action. Now the programme may pick up.

“The message this should send to foreign investors is it’s unwise to bet against MbS,” said Sam Blatteis, chief executive of regional advisory firm The MENA Catalysts, using a common abbreviation of Prince Mohammed’s name.

“When he wants to get things done, he has proven that he can. This is not a consolidation of power, it’s an acceleration. The wheels of policy-making are moving faster.”",Saudi purge worries investors but may speed reforms,https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-economy/saudi-purge-worries-investors-but-may-speed-reforms-idINKBN1D50SD

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.
But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

TRADE DEFICITS

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUSKBN1D620V?il=0

The White House says Trump’s trip is intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over his hard-line approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats, but many in the region fear that further bellicose presidential rhetoric could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict on the Korean peninsula.

Arriving in South Korea on the second stop of a five-country trek, Trump will tour the main garrison for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the sprawling Camp Humphreys, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea.

Trump is seeking to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang following a visit to Tokyo, where he said on Monday that America was working to counter North Korea’s “dangerous aggressions” and talked about Japan being able to shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” once it completes purchases of U.S. military equipment.

The South Korea visit also aims to shore up an uneasy alliance between Washington and Seoul, which has come under U.S. pressure over trade and defense spending.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States, for deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and for dismissing as pointless any diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

Kim, who has also made clear he has little interest in negotiations, at least until North Korea develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, has called Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s 12-day visit to the region. U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

U.S. Marines and South Korean forces will be conducting previously planned joint military drills in the northwestern part of South Korea during Trump’s visit, South Korea’s defense ministry said on Monday, an action that could further aggravate tension with Pyongyang.

Defending his tough talk against North Korea, Trump said in Tokyo: ”Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.”

SEOUL WARY OF PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO JAPAN

U.S. ally South Korea, meanwhile, is rolling out the red carpet for Trump but is also sensitive to the fact that he plans to spend only 24 hours in the country compared to 48 hours in Japan, the kind of comparison that South Koreans often make because of concerns they are a lesser U.S. priority than Tokyo, its richer neighbor.

While Trump has forged a strong bond with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as well as Chinese President Xi Jinping – who will host him later this week – South Korean officials say there has been less personal chemistry between him and their new liberal president, Moon Jae-in.

During the state visit, South Koreans are also bracing for the possibility that Trump will renew his criticism of Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – and will again threaten to pull out of a free trade pact between the two countries.

Trump has accused South Korea in the past of not paying its fair share for the cost of U.S. forces in the country. A South Korean presidential official said that Trump’s visit to Camp Humphreys would be a chance to inform him that Seoul paid more than 90 percent of some $10 billion in land and construction costs for the base.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.

Trump will steer clear of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) zone on the border between the two Koreas - where other U.S. presidents have visited - a move that might have been seen by North Korea as more of a provocation.

But the base visit will give him a first-hand view not only of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea but also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

Trump will also have talks on Tuesday with Moon at South Korea’s presidential Blue House, hold a joint news conference and attend a state dinner with traditional music and K-pop performances. He will wrap up his visit on Wednesday with an address to the National Assembly.",Trump's Seoul visit to put him at heart of North Korea nuclear standoff,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-trump-asia-southkorea/trumps-seoul-visit-to-put-him-at-heart-of-north-korea-nuclear-standoff-idUKKBN1D61ZR

FILE PHOTO: Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

FILE PHOTO: One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://in.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-offers-103-billion-for-qualcomm-sets-up-takeover-battle-idINKBN1D61EM

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

There have been 44 publicly announced freight movement and logistics deals within the U.S. so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, already topping the 38 deals announced in 2016. And the total is likely much higher because most deals are private, said Todd McMahon, managing director at investment bank Capstone Partners.

Trucking companies by late December must start using electronic logging devices, known as ELDs, to track the number of hours drivers are behind the wheel.

The new mandate makes it harder for trucking firms to dodge federal limits on the hours drivers can work and will likely cut into productivity, trucking industry officials have said. That would pressure already razor-thin margins at smaller trucking firms, fueling consolidation.

Executives at larger trucking companies and private equity firms have said they are aggressively hunting for deals.

And the trucking industry is recovering after a tough few years, making struggling firms more likely to sell, Dan Clark, transportation finance head at BMO Harris Bank, the largest U.S. truck-financing arm.

XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) Chief Executive Officer Brad Jacobs said last week the company has a war chest of up to $8 billion for possible deals in the coming months, and has narrowed its target list to dozens of companies.

XPO has used rapid-fire acquisitions to grow from a small truck brokerage into a diversified company. In a 2015 buying spree of roughly $6.5 billion, it snagged trucking and logistics firm Con-way for $3 billion as well as France’s Norbert Dentressangle for $3.53 billion.

Scott Wheeler, chief financial officer at Daseke Inc (DSKE.O), which hauls industrial equipment for customers like Caterpillar (CAT.N) and Deere & Co (DE.N) on flatbed and specialized trailers, said acquisitions will fuel the company’s rapid growth. Daseke, with a market value of $597 million, has closed four deals in 2017 with more due before year-end. “There is so much opportunity,” said Wheeler, whose finance team is evaluating numerous merger targets with well-managed fleets and revenue of $40 million to $250 million. Daseke is the largest carrier in the $133 billion open-deck and specialized trucking niche, yet still has less than one percent of this fragmented market.

In August, Green Bay, Wisconsin-based Schneider National Inc (SNDR.N) told analysts the company plans to focus on “specialty areas” for acquisitions.

Echo Global Logistics (ECHO.O), with a market value of $664 million, has an “active pipeline” of so-called tuck-in deals aimed at strengthening a particular division that they are working on, CEO Douglas Waggoner told investors.

Financial data provider Preqin said year-to-date North American fundraising for private equity funds that include logistics as part of a wider focus has hit $11.6 billion, compared to $7.5 billion for all of 2016. The top funds in that sector either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on their investment plans.

FLURRY OF ACTIVITY

The biggest deal so far this year was the merger of Swift Transportation Co, the sixth-largest U.S. trucking company, and Knight Transportation Inc (KNX.N), the 23rd-largest, creating the biggest truckload operator in North America with a combined market value of more than $5 billion. [L3N1HI3S9]

“The big are getting bigger and then, with Knight-Swift, that’s the big-big getting huge,” said Jeff Sass, senior vice president at truckmaker Navistar International Corp (NAV.N).

For a FACTBOX on major deals this year see:

Industry executives say the electronic log rules give big trucking companies who already use electronic logs a stronger hand in the market.

Companies like Schneider and Covenant Transportation Group Inc (CVTI.O), which provides long-haul services, have used electronic logs for years and backed the rule. But the mandate could sap productivity by 3 percent to 15 percent, according to industry estimates.

Trucking firms have also had to raise driver pay as they struggle to attract and retain drivers amid a general driver shortage and tight U.S. labor markets, which has also pressured margins.

In addition, many owners of family-owned truck firms that launched following industry deregulation, which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes from 1980, have hit or are approaching retirement age with children pursuing different careers.

For many, their options are sell out, or shut down.

“It’s (the pace of acquisitions) been as busy as we’ve seen it since we started the business 13 years ago,” said Jim Parham, managing partner Florida-based M&A advisory firm Transport Capital Partners.

“We expect this pace to continue, if not accelerate, in the coming months,” Parham said.

Parham hopes to close four deals between firms with revenue of between $10 million to $250 million in the coming weeks but declined to provide specifics.

In February, Parham helped less-than-truckload carrier Central Freight Lines buy Wilson Trucking Corp out of Waco, Texas, another LTL carrier, to expand into the U.S. Southeast. LTL carriers consolidate smaller freight loads onto a single truck.

QUALITY AN ISSUE

Some privately held carriers are focused on building out their own fleet rather than buying other firms.

Brad Pinchuk, CEO of Dubuque, Iowa-based Hirschbach Motor Lines, said finding companies to buy that match his modern fleet and low annual driver turnover is tough. He has pursued aggressive expansion, nearly tripling his fleet since 2013 to around 1,100 trucks.

Pinchuk says the outlook for family-owned truck firms is bleak because major customers want a handful of big suppliers.

“Our big customers are getting bigger and they are doing business with fewer transportation providers,” Pinchuk said. “That makes it pretty darn tough for a small guy to do business directly with a large shipper.”

Certain niche, higher-margin truckers may be targeted by private equity firms, said Capstone’s McMahon.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets and rejects the financial damages claim.

Uber and Waymo, rivals in the development of autonomous car technology, have been fighting in court since earlier this year about whether Uber benefited from trade secrets and other intellectual property allegedly stolen by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. Trial is set for early December.

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup late on Thursday issued an order excluding Waymo’s damages expert, Michael Wagner, from the case and restricting use of financial evidence at trial and denying other relief, according to a docket entry.

The docket summarizes the decision, but the details are under seal until later on Friday.

University of Florida law professor Elizabeth Rowe said it was a setback for Waymo to have its damages expert excluded, but noted there were still ways to include the information, were the scope of the exclusion limited to the one person.

In a statement, Waymo said the company could still pursue full damages using “the same documents” relied upon by their expert.

Uber described the ruling on the expert as a sign of success, together with Alsup’s exclusion of Otto Trucking as a defendant in the case. Levandowski is the primary shareholder of Otto Trucking.

“Waymo’s case continues to shrink,” the ride-services company said in a statement.

Alsup recently agreed to Waymo’s request to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that Levandowski - the former head of Uber’s self-driving effort who was previously at Waymo - downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Waymo to set up a self-driving truck startup company that Uber then acquired.

Waymo in settlement talks had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, which rejected that and other terms as non-starters, sources previously told Reuters.

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store.","NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shoppers surged into Apple Inc stores across the world on Friday to buy the new iPhone X, signaling stronger demand for the 10th anniversary version of the premium smartphone than the last two iterations.

Investors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the company’s better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.

Apple’s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world’s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.

“I can’t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,” said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block.

Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.

“I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”

The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States.

The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.

Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.

In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.

“I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.

GLOBAL EXCITEMENT

Similar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.

In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.

“It’s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I‘m excited,” builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line. He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.

In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.

“I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.

In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.

Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.

Newly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters. In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary model’s starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).

SUPPLY CLOSER TO DEMAND

Analysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand. The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.

But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.

“Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said.

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.

The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.

Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion.

Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.

“We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.",Long lines for iPhone X help push Apple shares to record high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/long-lines-for-iphone-x-help-push-apple-shares-to-record-high-idUSKBN1D22Y2

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Segundo ele, o incremento nos desembolsos se dará na esteira da expectativa de um crescimento maior do PIB, de cerca de 3 por cento em 2018.

O presidente do BNDES afirmou durante evento da revista Exame, no Rio de Janeiro, que aposta num salto nas liberações de capital de giro para micro, pequenas e médias empresas neste último bimestre do ano. Com isso, os empréstimos do BNDES este ano ficariam “ligeiramente abaixo dos 80 bilhões de reais”.

“Os 77 bi devemos atingir sem coeficiente extra de aceleração. Gostaríamos de chegar a 80 bilhões se conseguirmos acrescentar mais 500 milhões por mês no BNDES Giro”, acrescentou referindo-se à linha de financiamento do banco para capital de giro das empresas.

Diante da fraca demanda por crédito, o governo decidiu cobrar esse ano a devolução de parte dos recursos emprestados pelo Tesouro ao BNDES ao longo dos últimos anos, que totalizaram cerca de 500 bilhões de reais. Só esse ano, o BNDES devolveu 50 bi de reais ao Tesouro e a União demanda mais 130 bilhões em 2018.

“O BNDES é especialista em milagres e vamos conseguir ajudar o governo e fazer com que o BNDES Giro, gire”, disse Castro.

O presidente do banco de fomento defendeu o uso de parte das reservas internacionais para ajudar o governo a resolver o déficit fiscal e otimizar a governança de empresas estatais. Segundo ele, o governo poderia usar até 30 bilhões de dólares das reservas internacionais para essa finalidade.

“As reservas internacionais fazem parte da segurança financeira do Brasil. Usar 20 bilhões ou 30 bilhões (de dólares) não afetariam a segurança do país”, disse Castro. “Esses recursos poderiam ser usados para acelerar um processo de desestatização, em tese da Eletrobras...o fundo compraria cotas no país e anteciparia a compra de parte de uma estatal qualquer com entrada de um sócio privado”, afirmou o presidente do BNDES.

“Esse processo bota mais dinheiro no bolso de quem vende, e, a União tem que vender ao melhor preço. Antecipa recursos e otimiza gestão da empresa”, acrescentou.","BNDES prevê desembolso de R$97 bi em 2018, diz presidente",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1D61YK-OBRBS

The army terminated combat operations in southern Marawi two weeks ago after killing what it believed were the last remnants of a rebel alliance that held parts of the lakeside city for five months.

Following the country’s biggest security crisis in decades, troops have made significant gains in the week since they killed Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group and anointed “emir” of Islamic State in Southeast Asia.

His assumed deputy, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was also believe killed, as was Omarkhayan Maute, a top operative in the alliance.

“We are still looking for Amin Baco,” Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said, describing the Malaysian as the likely new “successor as the emir of those terrorists”.

More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest, a crisis that shocked predominantly Catholic Philippines and led to unease about Islamic State gaining traction in Muslim parts of the island of Mindanao.

Police chief Ronaldo dela Rosa said he received similar information that Baco, an expert bomb-maker, had assumed the role of Islamic State’s point man.

Experts say Baco was trained under Malaysian militant Zulkifli bin Hir, alias Marwan, who was killed in 2015 in a clash in marshlands in Maguindanao province that left 44 police commandoes dead.

The information that Baco could be in charge came from an Indonesian arrested in Marawi last week, dela Rosa said.

Despite declaring the end of operations, troops are still fighting some hold-outs hiding amid the ruins of a city battered by months of air strikes. Troops have since killed nine gunmen in Marawi, Colonel Romeo Brawner said on Monday, emphasizing why residents were being kept out of the pulverized battle zone.

Baco was reported to have been killed in Marawi but intelligence sources said he had fled.

“He could be somewhere on Jolo island or in nearby Maguindanao,” an army colonel familiar with Islamist militant groups in Mindanao, told Reuters.

He said Baco had been in the Philippines for a long time and had links with regional extremist group Jemaah Islamiah. He was married to a daughter of a local militant sub-leader.

As early as 2011, he was facilitating movements into the Philippines of funds, arms and fighters from Indonesia and Malaysia, but his links to the Islamic State network were not known to be strong, another military intelligence official said.

Paddy Cosgrave, whose annual Web Summit takes place in Lisbon this week, joins growing calls for tighter regulation of big technology firms especially after news that Russia may have manipulated the last U.S. election with political advertisements on Facebook.

He said recent initiatives by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager could bring big changes for big tech companies and help level the playing field in a sector which is having a profound impact on societies.

Vestager, who will speak at the Web Summit on Tuesday, has levied huge fines for unpaid taxes and unfair competition on big technology firms, including Apple, Google and Amazon in the past couple of years.

“In economic terms these (companies) would appear to fall into a classic definition of monopolies,” Cosgrave told Reuters in an interview.

“And if she (Vestager) is successful she will probably set the standard for the rest of the world and will usher in a fundamental change in how the largest and most profitable companies in the history of the world are treated. This changes the playing field for all other companies.”

Cosgrave said that new technology had been assumed by many to be just positive, but it often “can be incredibly disruptive”.

He said the need for new rules was similar to past technological shifts such as the invention of cars.

“We had an operating system that, by and large with some modifications every decade, worked for the last 200 years,” Cosgrave said.

“And then suddenly, you’d have to be naive or have your head buried in the sand, to not realize that the very fabric of our society, certainly western society, feels like it’s getting pulled and stretched in weird ways. I think we need ... a new operating system.”

Web Summit has grown into one of the world’s largest technology conferences, from 400 participants when it started in Dublin in 2010, to 59,000 participants this week. It started as a venue for tech startups and includes investors, but also increasingly politicians and regulators. U.N.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal.

This season’s standout players both exited Stamford Bridge after frustrating periods under former manager Jose Mourinho, who recognised but failed to realise their potential.

De Bruyne and Salah each refocused their careers elsewhere in Europe before arriving back in the Premier League bristling with intent - at City and Liverpool respectively.

De Bruyne, in particular, has been instrumental in City’s astonishing start to a season in which they have scored 52 goals in all competitions.

The Belgian is no one-season wonder, however, and over the past five years only Barcelona’s Lionel Messi has recorded more assists in Europe’s top five leagues, with De Bruyne’s performances at City turbo-charged by Pep Guardiola’s arrival as manager.

On Saturday, he scored City’s opener in the 3-1 win over Arsenal, exchanging passes with Fernandinho before unleashing an angled drive into the bottom corner.

De Bruyne’s performances make Mourinho’s decision to ditch him from Chelsea after just 33 games in two years all the more questionable, although the Portuguese insisted he had his reasons.

“He was not training very well. He was saying: ‘I can’t give you more. This is just my way’,” said Mourinho when asked about the departure.

Salah received even less of a chance at Chelsea after arriving from Basel soon after De Bruyne left Stamford Bridge for Wolfsburg in January, 2014.

The Egyptian failed to make an impact in 12 months under Mourinho, moving to Fiorentina on loan as a makeweight in a deal in which Juan Cuadrado, another soon-to-be Chelsea misfit, headed the other way.

Salah’s switch proved the making of him and, after arriving at Anfield via Roma, the 25-year-old’s impact this season has been great. On Saturday he scored his 11th and 12th goals in 17 games, the best striking record by anyone at the club since Michael Owen in 2001-02, who also reached his 12-goal mark on Nov. 4 that season.

STRIKING GREAT

Not surprisingly, Salah’s rich scoring seam is delighting manager Juergen Klopp.

“I didn’t think if he can score 12 goals or whatever in 17 games,” the Liverpool coach said. “But I hope he’s not finished now!”

Owen ended with 28 goals in 43 appearances in 2002 and Salah, who needs just three more to beat last season’s Liverpool top scorer, Philippe Coutinho, could yet join another Reds great, Luis Suarez, as one of the few strikers to notch 30 goals in a season.

There is little doubt the presence of De Bruyne and Salah in Chelsea’s ranks would have improved their early results this season.

But perhaps both needed the disappointment of their Chelsea rejections to reach their current heights.

Watford’s Nathaniel Chalobah is another who quit the club this year only to be rewarded with an England call-up. Tammy Abraham, on loan at Swansea City, also made national manager Gareth Southgate’s squad after failing to break through at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is insistent that under his regime, all the club’s young talent has a pathway to the first team and points to his own record as Juventus manager where he nurtured Paul Pogba, who is now playing under Mourinho at Manchester United.

But for all Conte’s fine words, it is clear that De Bruyne and Salah were allowed to slip through the net at Chelsea, a mistake so costly it may stop the champions from successfully defending their title.",Soccer: Chelsea rejects blaze a trail through Premier League,https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-che-castoffs/soccer-chelsea-rejects-blaze-a-trail-through-premier-league-idINKBN1D6247

Other members of the consortium include Norwegian oil firm Statoil, trading houses Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria, and banks ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale.

Blockchain technology, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, uses a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.

Mercuria has been a vocal advocate of implementing blockchain technology to significantly cut costs in oil trading.

“Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,” said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC.

Similar efforts for an energy trading platform have failed to take off, Bell said, but added this latest bid with backing from BP and Shell and the banks, “may have more success than if it were an independent party trying to convince oil and gas companies to make use of it.”

The new venture is seeking regulatory approvals and would be run as an independent entity, the consortium said in a statement.

“The platform aims to reduce administrative operational risks and costs of physical energy trading, and improve the reliability and efficiency of back-end trading operations...,” the statement said.

On Sunday, Mohammed bin Salman turned the same venue – the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh – into a posh detention center for princes, ministers and other elites rounded up in a sudden anti-corruption drive. It could do the likely next Saudi king’s ambitious economic and social reforms more harm than good.

Among those detained was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose investments in Citigroup, Twitter and other firms make him the most recognizable Saudi on Wall Street, along with another 10 princes. Four ministers were also held, Reuters reported, as was former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco director who rubbed elbows at the recent Future Investment Initiative shindig at the Ritz-Carlton with the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman.

Corruption may be a problem, but the weekend move also looks like a strike against potential opposition. The crown prince has vowed to take Saudi mores back to a time before 1979, when the seizure of the Grand Mosque by armed militants brought religious conservatives into control. Having charmed financiers at the event dubbed Davos in the desert with his vision for a $500 billion global city he calls NEOM, among other things, the crown prince may have felt emboldened to move rapidly.

The clampdown on perceived members of the old guard, many blessed with extraordinary birthright wealth, was seen favorably by many Saudis, according to Reuters. Though the domestic stock market initially sank 2.2 percent, it closed higher.

Yet Sunday’s purge raises more questions than it answers. Among them: What is the nature of the charges, and the evidence for them? Did a public spat with Donald Trump play a role in Prince Alwaleed’s arrest? Was the monarchy threatened with a coup, or was it a pre-emptive initiative?

More lastingly, the weekend’s events underline that Saudi is an absolute monarchy. That can mean whims, plots and retribution matter more than transparency and a predictable rule of law.

Reuters requests for comment from Weinstein’s representative and his lawyer were not immediately answered.

New York City Police Department Deputy Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told a news conference that the alleged victim “put forth a credible and detailed narrative.”

“We have an actual case here,” Boyce said. He said the police department became aware of the accusation on October 25.

Boyce said it was a seven-year-old case and “we have to move forward gathering evidence.”

Boyce said that because Weinstein was out of state the police department would need a court-ordered warrant for any arrest.

More than 50 women have claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

Boyce said police had spoken to the woman and “we found corroboration along the way.”

Qualcomm, which has been fighting a legal battle on many fronts with Apple Inc, said revenue from areas other than smartphones was more than $3 billion in its latest fiscal year, up more than 25 percent from last year.

Revenue from Qualcomm’s chip unit, which supplies both Android smartphone makers and Apple, rose 13 percent in the latest quarter. Licensing revenue, which includes royalties mostly from Apple, sank 36 percent.

Reuters reported earlier this week that Apple would drop the Qualcomm’s chips altogether from its iPhones and iPads from next year, the latest salvo in a longstanding dispute between the two companies.

Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and of refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm also sued some Apple contract manufacturers in April over royalty payments and is trying to ban the sale of iPhones in China.

“We really try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple ... (and) we do have a lot of engagement with the company and we do speak in our engage on a daily basis with them across multiple areas,” Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call.

Qualcomm continues to exclude from its forecast revenue related to the sale of Apple products by the iPhone maker’s contract manufacturers as well as the another licensee in dispute.

It forecast current-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and adjusted earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents per share.

Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.90 billion and a profit of 90 cents per share, per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

While Qualcomm and Apple would be better off with each other, Qualcomm will do just fine even if that’s not the case, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said.

Qualcomm also reported better-than expected profit and sales for the fourth quarter, despite earnings tumbling nearly 90 percent due to a $778 million charge related to a fine imposed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission for anti-trust violations.

The company' adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share beat estimates of 81 cents. Revenue fell 4.5 percent to $5.91 billion, but topped estimates of $5.80 billion. (bit.ly/2z5MwMB)

Paddy Cosgrave, whose annual Web Summit takes place in Lisbon this week, joins growing calls for tighter regulation of big technology firms especially after news that Russia may have manipulated the last U.S. election with political advertisements on Facebook.

He said recent initiatives by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager could bring big changes for big tech companies and help level the playing field in a sector which is having a profound impact on societies.

Vestager, who will speak at the Web Summit on Tuesday, has levied huge fines for unpaid taxes and unfair competition on big technology firms, including Apple, Google and Amazon in the past couple of years.

“In economic terms these (companies) would appear to fall into a classic definition of monopolies,” Cosgrave told Reuters in an interview.

“And if she (Vestager) is successful she will probably set the standard for the rest of the world and will usher in a fundamental change in how the largest and most profitable companies in the history of the world are treated. This changes the playing field for all other companies.”

Cosgrave said that new technology had been assumed by many to be just positive, but it often “can be incredibly disruptive”.

He said the need for new rules was similar to past technological shifts such as the invention of cars.

“We had an operating system that, by and large with some modifications every decade, worked for the last 200 years,” Cosgrave said.

“And then suddenly, you’d have to be naive or have your head buried in the sand, to not realize that the very fabric of our society, certainly western society, feels like it’s getting pulled and stretched in weird ways. I think we need ... a new operating system.”

Web Summit has grown into one of the world’s largest technology conferences, from 400 participants when it started in Dublin in 2010, to 59,000 participants this week. It started as a venue for tech startups and includes investors, but also increasingly politicians and regulators. U.N.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that Manafort has offered to pledge in exchange for lifting his house arrest restrictions, especially several life insurance policies that are held in trust and in his wife’s name.

Having a family member who is serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, she said, “is very problematic.”

Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with some of Trump’s campaign associates.

One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal and act in the best interests of its shareholders. The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but it did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to the sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a legal dispute with Apple Inc, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

Shares of Qualcomm were up 3.5 percent at $63.98 in premarket trading, well below the offer price, indicating that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

“In our view, $70 per share wouldn’t be sufficient,” Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a client note.

Qualcomm shares traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

Canaccord Genuity analysts said they believed Qualcomm’s board would likely reject the initial bid as too low and said the company would prefer to remain independent.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company that is based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan appeared at the White House last week with U.S. President Donald Trump, describing the United States as a great country for businesses.

Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple , Samsung and LG that help phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny.

“The Street is factoring in regulatory, shareholder, and financial hurdles with this deal, as it’s not a friendly deal,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters

“While this deal certainly presents regulatory hurdles to overcome this is a smart move for Broadcom as the company finds itself in a position of strength to acquire Qualcomm and create a juggernaut that could dominate key parts of the tech food chain,” Ives said.

To complicate matters, Qualcomm is trying to close its $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Shah said Broadcom would encourage Qualcomm to complete its NXP acquisition as it has extensive distribution channels, scale and exposure to the fastest growing segments in automotive, where Broadcom is weaker.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

But regulation that sheds light on such deals is getting tighter, while technology makes leaks more likely.

Last year’s Panama Papers helped to topple elected leaders. Now an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists into 13.4 million financial statements, emails, loan agreements and other paperwork has uncovered politicians, financiers and companies using secrecy to hide transactions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had an investment in a shipping firm with significant ties to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ICIJ says. Even Queen Elizabeth invested through offshore companies.

There can be legitimate reasons for wanting to hide business interests offshore, especially for those living in turbulent countries. But getting away from tax and law-enforcement authorities is getting more complicated, and therefore dearer.

More than 100 jurisdictions – including several offshore financial centres – have committed to automatically exchange tax information with foreign governments. About 50 started sharing data in September, making it harder for individuals and companies to hide their financial dealings. Meanwhile, countries including Britain and Sweden have passed legislation that forces foreign companies and legal entities operating within their borders to disclose their ultimate owner – bypassing the often complex chain of offshore vehicles and trusts. Others, including the United States, are also introducing or tightening beneficial ownership rules.

Regulation will not stop the global flow of illicit money. Loopholes can always be found, and there are enough dark spots on the planet. But technology which makes it easier to download, distribute and organise massive volumes of data also facilitates leaks. For legitimate investors and corporations, secrecy may end up becoming too much of a costly liability.",Breakingviews - Offshore secrecy succumbs to diminishing returns,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paradise-tax-breakingviews/breakingviews-offshore-secrecy-succumbs-to-diminishing-returns-idUKKBN1D61IW

Mnangagwa’s removal provides a boost for Mugabe’s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.

“The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,” Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.

“It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.”

Mnangagwa’s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.

Grace, 52, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a “coup plotter” and a “coward” on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time.

The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war.

Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations.

FALLEN PROTEGE

The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation.

Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men.

FILE PHOTO: President Robert Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe looks on during a national church interface rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 5, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo

By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980.

However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence.

Mnangagwa’s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF.

Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa’s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

That Mnangagwa’s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship.

Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition.

The militant, identified as Abu Siddiq Sohel, 34, a member of the al Qaeda-inspired militant group Ansar Ullah Bangla Team, is suspected of taking part in the killing of writer Avijit Roy, deputy police commissioner Masudur Rahman said.

Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was hacked to death by machete-wielding attackers in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. Roy’s widow, Rafida Ahmed, was maimed in the attack.

Sohel, who was identified after analysing CCTV footage, was arrested in the capital, Dhaka, on Sunday night, Rahman told Reuters.

A total of eight people took part in the killing, Sohel said in court on Monday, court officials said. However, he denied he was directly involved in the killing, saying four people carried out the actual attack on Roy while others assisted.

Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country of 160 million people, is struggling to control attacks by Islamist groups on secular bloggers, atheists, foreigners and religious minorities.

The most serious recent attack came in July 2016, when gunmen stormed a restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of Dhaka and killed 22 people, most of them foreigners.

Police say the militant group is behind the killings of more than a dozen secular bloggers and gay rights activists. They believe a sacked army major, who is still at large, was the leader of the group and masterminded the killings.

Al Qaeda and Islamic State have also claimed responsibility for a series of killings over the past few years, including Roy‘s.

Authorities have consistently ruled out the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead. However, security experts say the scale and sophistication of the restaurant attack suggested links to a wider network.

FILE PHOTO: A Chinese national flag flutters outside the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the Chinese central bank, in Beijing, China April 3, 2014. REUTERS/Petar Kujundzic/File Photo

That strategy was amplified at the recently-concluded Communist Party Congress by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who set the tone for policy by emphasizing quality over quantity in boosting economic growth and pledging to win the war on pollution.

While the government splurged on infrastructure projects, keeping fiscal policy fairly loose and stoking surprisingly strong growth through the year, authorities have also ramped up efforts to reduce China’s years-long addiction to debt.

“We expect growth to slow in October,” said Wendy Chen, an economist for Nomura in Shanghai.

Chen expects the gradual slowdown to extend through to the end of the year as pollution curbs hit factory output and weaker property and infrastructure spending cool investment growth.

Indeed, growth in factory output is seen slowing to 6.3 percent year-on-year in October from September’s 6.6 percent, according to a Reuters poll of 32 economists.

The war on pollution was partly to blame for third quarter growth cooling slightly to 6.8 percent, from the first half’s 6.9 percent.

Yet those numbers defied market expectations for a sharper slowdown this year, as the government-backed construction boom drove up prices from cement to steel and glass in a boost to overall economic output.

And October data is again expected to show growth will easily hit Beijing’s 6.5 percent target for 2017 as surging profits see factories expanding output, albeit at a slower pace, and resilient consumer spending supports broad activity.

Policymakers could face a delicate balancing act over the next year, analysts say, as they target high-risk lending to firms and the property sector, while taking long-overdue steps to bring polluting factories to heel.

There are some mixed signals about how strict this winter’s anti-pollution measures will actually be.

A government official on Tuesday said pollution measures in October hurt output at some firms, which was reflected in an official survey of the sector, while iron ore futures prices rose on Friday after production cuts at steel plants appeared to be less than expected.

Fixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.4 percent in the Jan-Oct period, down slightly from a 7.5 percent rise in the first three quarters of the year.

Retail sales growth is seen edging up to 10.4 percent on-year from 10.3 percent the previous month.

Industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail sales data are set to be published on Nov. 14.

TRUMP AND TRADE

China is set to announce October trade data on Wednesday, the same day United States President Donald Trump arrives in Beijing for his first visit to China.

Trump has railed against China’s massive trade surplus with the U.S., and bilateral trade is set to feature prominently in discussions.

China’s trade surplus with the U.S. in September was the highest ever for any single month, based on Reuters calculations of official data going back to 2008, even as its overall surplus narrowed.

Economists expect China’s exports to have risen 7.2 percent on-year in October, slower than 8.1 percent the previous month, while imports may have jumped 16.0 percent, producing a trade surplus of $39.5 billion.

LOAN GROWTH TO SLOW

The governor of the People’s Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan in comments over the weekend again warned about the risk from high leverage in China’s financial system, saying that China must prevent “black swan” events, which refers to major, unexpected occurrences.

Worries about a rapid build-up in China’s debt prompted S&P Global Ratings to downgrade China’s sovereign credit rating in September, following a cut by Moody’s in May.

China has mostly put the brakes on a buildup in corporate debt this year. Regulators have now also zoomed in on the risks from disguised property debt as investors look for ways around rules.

Economists expect that new loans in October dropped to a one-year low of 780 billion yuan ($117.59 billion) as banks restrict mortgage lending and corporates continue to shun bank loans.

Despite government rhetoric about the deleveraging drive, bank lending would have to drop sharply from this year’s trend for new loans not to surpass last year’s total and reach a new high.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

Their revised plan, unveiled on Thursday, only partly deals with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House - Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin - have fumbled their way through their own script.

GOP leaders in the House of Representatives have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax for the highest earners of nearly 40 percent. But they’re cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships. Many wealthy people, including President Donald Trump and some in his cabinet, have made liberal use of these.

And they’re doubling the exemption and then repealing the estate tax over the next six years. Trump in September claimed this so-called death tax would “protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.” Yet it only affects about 0.2 percent of the population – ultra-wealthy families, in other words. Its repeal would save Trump’s family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, argue Democrats.

Comments made by Trump administration officials aren’t helping. Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year. He’s vastly overstating it: the median annual U.S. household income in 2016 was about $59,000. The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure.

Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message. After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune. He told Politico it’s difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because “the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.” It’s actually more like the top 50 percent of earners. His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: he reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures.

Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it’ll put the Trump administration’s goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy. That’d be a dismal failure going into an election year.",Breakingviews - Botched Republican pitch bodes ill for tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-breakingviews/breakingviews-botched-republican-pitch-bodes-ill-for-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1D22PS

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

The bank raised its forecast for the average Brent price in the fourth quarter of this year by $6 to $60 a barrel, and its full-year 2018 forecast by $3 to $55 a barrel.

Speculators have also increased to a record high their bets on gains in the price of Brent.

ICE commitment-of-traders data showed money managers had increased their net long holdings of Brent crude futures and options by 23,500 contracts to 530,237.

Money managers raised their net long commitments on WTI by 63,072 contracts to 343,705 over the same period, a more than six-month high.","Oil at highest since mid-2015 on Saudi purge, tighter markets",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-at-highest-since-mid-2015-on-saudi-purge-tighter-markets-idUSKBN1D603A

New orders growth accelerated despite firms increasing their prices at the joint fastest rate since the middle of 2011. The output price index rose to a seven-month high of 53.1 from 52.7.

More expensive energy and intermediate goods pushed up euro zone prices at factory gates more than expected in September, data from the European Union’s statistics office showed on Monday.

“Some price rises merely reflect the pass-through of higher costs, but companies are also reporting stronger pricing power as demand conditions continue to improve, which suggests underlying inflationary pressures are becoming more engrained,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

Robust growth alongside increasing price pressures will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who last month took a step toward weaning the euro zone off loose money.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

Kim has traded insults and nuclear threats with U.S. President Donald Trump for months, raising concerns that the Games, due to be held at an alpine resort 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most heavily fortified border, could be marred by political tensions, or worse.

Economic sanctions on the reclusive nation are mounting but the sporting world and South Korea are doing everything in their power to try to coax Pyongyang to accept an invitation to the Games and relieve geopolitical tensions that have hurt ticket sales.

“We are doing our utmost for the North’s participation,” said Song Ki-hun, a lawmaker with South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s party. “But Kim Jong Un is very unpredictable,” added Song. He is based near the Games venue and sits on a special parliamentary committee to support the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Kim, a basketball fan who counts former NBA star Dennis Rodman as a friend, has boosted spending on sports as part of his ambition to turn the North into a ""sports power.""

If the North joins the Games, it would mark the first time in post-war Olympic history that a country has hosted a team from a nation with which it is officially at war. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

The last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, the 1988 summer Games in Seoul, North Korea’s founding father, Kim Il Sung, boycotted them after a plan to co-host them fell apart.

“With North Korea there, things will be smoother,” said a European official from a winter sports federation, asking not to be identified because of the political sensitivity of the subject. “The Games will only be really successful if they are smooth. If the United States, North Korea and China all have their teams in South Korea then that will be a success.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the prospect of U.S. athletes competing with North Korea, a country Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” if provoked.

North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and South Korea to join the Games. But Games officials have said the North could wait until shortly before the Games to say whether it will join.

The IOC said its help so far has mainly been with travel and competition costs, and it will consider wild-card entries for those who do not meet qualification standards.

Seoul has said it is even open to forming a unified North-South ice hockey team. Pyongyang’s IOC representative dismissed that idea in a recent media interview, but a South Korean culture ministry official said Seoul had not abandoned it.

Seoul’s other gestures include a rare proposal for North Korean athletes to enter the South by walking across the border at Panmunjom, the tense and heavily guarded “truce village” where the 1953 armistice was signed.

GOING FOR GLORY

Kim Jong Un, grandson of founder Kim Il Sung, has made sport a major focus of his plan to improve living standards. Since he assumed power in 2011, spending on sport in the nation’s annual budgets has risen faster than most other areas, according to state media reports.

The reports, which only give percentage data, include a record 17 percent jump in funding in 2014 when Kim set out his ambition for sports in an open letter to his Workers’ Party.

He urged the party and athletes to help make sport part of daily life and uphold “the party’s plan of building our country into a sports power, sweat more in training in order to bring glory to the country by winning gold medals.”

He also had school textbooks revised to say that he began shooting a gun at age 3, was off-road driving before turning 8, and had twice beaten foreign master mariners in ship races, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, the think tank of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service in Seoul. Reuters could not verify that report.

Simon Cockerell, head of Beijing-based Koryo Tours, which has brought competitors to the North for events ranging from the Pyongyang Marathon to Frisbee-throwing and cricket, said he had noticed an increasing focus on sports under Kim.

“More events seem to be happening, DPRK sports teams are traveling more than ever, and success is celebrated more than before,” said Cockerell, using the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

At the 2014 Asian Games in South Korea, North Korea’s athletes won 11 gold medals, ranking sixth, and were welcomed with a victory parade and a banquet with Kim who thanked them for validating the “party’s plan for building a sports powerhouse.”

The North is developing sports grounds and arenas, according to Curtis Melvin, of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, where satellite imagery is used to map the North’s economic development.

“Satellite imagery shows lots of park renovation and construction of skate and sports parks, even in very remote areas,” Melvin said.

Kim Jong Un, who studied in the Swiss capital Bern and according to former classmates went on school ski trips in the Alps, has already built a ski resort.

HOCKEY STICKS

So far, only two North Korean athletes have qualified for the Games: figure-skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, whose routines have been set to music by The Beatles and Ginette Reno’s “Je ne suis qu‘une chanson.”

An IOC official said others could qualify for cross-country skiing, and possibly speed skating and biathlon, a combination of skiing and shooting.

Even if they do not, Games organizing committee chief Lee Hee-beom told Reuters athletes may be invited to compete - a common Olympics practice to encourage participation by underdogs, for instance athletes from a tropical country in a winter sport. One famous example brought a Jamaican bobsleigh team to Calgary in 1988. That inspired a movie based on their exploits.

An extra problem for North Korea could be sanctions. In March last year, the U.N. Security Council added “recreational sports equipment” to a list of luxury goods banned from export to the state. North Korea’s National Sports Guidance Committee has accused Washington of using the United Nations to stretch “its tentacles deep into the area of sports.”

Other officers on horseback saluted as the cars carrying the mens’ bodies passed through the streets of Buenos Aires.

Family members, who had flown to New York after the attack to bring home the victims, were expected to take another flight from Buenos Aires to Rosario on Monday morning, according to local media.

The victims are Hernán Ferruchi, 48, Alejandro Damián Pagnucco, 49, Diego Enrique Angelini, 48, Hernán Diego Mendoza, 48 and Ariel Erlij, 48.

The five, who were businessmen or architects, were among eight people killed in the truck attack as they rode bicycles on a pedestrian path in lower Manhattan along the Hudson River on Oct. 31. The Argentines were part of a group of 10 friends who had traveled to New York to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation.

Argentine President Maurico Macri is expected to visit the site of the attack on Monday to pay tribute to the victims while he is in New York on a previously planned trip to meet with investors and business executives.

Rosario entered a three-day mourning period after the deadly attack. The victims’ high school, where administrators said life-long friendships are common among students, is observing a week-long mourning period and counseling students on the circumstances of the attack.

Guillermo Banchini, one of the men on the trip who survived the attack, urged justice as he spoke from the Argentine counsel in New York on Friday.

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

FILE PHOTO: One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-offers-103-billion-for-qualcomm-sets-up-takeover-battle-idUKKBN1D61EO

Ross was responding in media interviews to reports on Sunday about his investments stemming from the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investment that relate to the affairs of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“There is nothing wrong with anything that was done,” Ross told CNBC, adding that he had not considered resigning following Sunday’s report. Ross is a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which the New York Times said earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for Russian petrochemical firm Sibur.

The Times, which based its report on files from prominent offshore law firm Appleby, said Sibur stakeholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and Putin associate who is subject to U.S. sanctions, and Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.

Navigator was mentioned in Ross’s 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. The Times said the latest batch of documents provided more insight into his financial holdings.

Reuters was not able to confirm the Times’ findings.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest such holdings.

The investments raised questions about whose interests Ross represents, Blumenthal said, calling for an inspector general probe by the department as well as congressional hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC in an interview.

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

SANCTIONS

In an earlier statement, a Department of Commerce spokesman said Ross “was not involved in Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur ... has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship”.

He added that Sibur had not been under sanctions when Navigator began its relationship with the publicly-traded firm and still was not.

“A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period. It was a normal commercial relationship and one that I had nothing to do with the creation of, and do not know the shareholders who were apparently sanctioned at some later point in time,” Ross told CNBC.

In a statement, Sibur said it had no direct dealings with Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.

Neither Navigator nor Appleby were available for comment on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Timchenko declined to comment, while Shamalov did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

In its report, the Times said Ross had kept the investment in Navigator, which increased its business dealings with Sibur, including chartering ships, even as Western nations sought to punish Russia’s energy sector over Putin’s incursions into Ukraine.

“The Secretary recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,” the Commerce Department spokesman said, adding that Ross maintains the “highest ethical standards.”

Separately, the Times cited Appleby’s files in another report that said hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin were behind Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner’s investments in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

QUEEN‘S TAXES

Citing the Appleby documents, Britain’s Guardian newspaper said millions of pounds from Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, had been invested in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio never before disclosed.

Reuters could not independently confirm the Guardian report.

The newspaper said the Duchy had used offshore private equity funds designed to shield investors in the United Kingdom from having to pay U.S. tax on their holdings.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.”

The spokeswoman also said the Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income received from the Duchy.

Citing the documents, Guardian also reported that international trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) had “secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars” to Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a mining deal in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The British newspaper said Gertler had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters was not immediately able to contact him.

Glencore said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, but dated Oct. 27 and addressed to the ICIJ, that it had made a loan to a company affiliated to Gertler in 2009 on commercial terms and that it was fully repaid.

“In February 2009, Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd made a loan to Lora Enterprises Limited (Lora), an entity affiliated with Mr Gertler,” the company said.

“The loan to Lora was made on commercial terms negotiated at arm’s length,” it said. “The loan was fully repaid by Lora in 2010.”",U.S. commerce chief Ross: Nothing improper about his Russia-tied investments,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-paradise-tax-usa/u-s-commerce-chief-ross-nothing-improper-about-his-russia-tied-investments-idUSKBN1D516X?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

The Facebook page and other social media sites were bombarded by criticisms of the change. Many Persian speakers say the name Dari has been imposed historically by the traditionally dominant Pashto ethnic group as an implicit denial of Afghanistan’s place in the wider Persian-speaking world.

The reaction highlighted the sensitivity of linguistic issues in Afghanistan, a country with a mix of over 35 languages spoken by ethnic groups including Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras as well as Uzbeks and Turkmen.

It also echoed some of the tensions around the government led by President Ashraf Ghani, which was formed after the disputed 2014 election and which is seen by many Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras as favoring his own Pashtun ethnicity.

While the Persian spoken in Afghanistan and neighboring Iran have distinct accents and numerous variations in vocabulary and usage, other essentials are the same, with the gap between the two sometimes compared to the differences between the French spoken in France and Canada.

“My language is Farsi,” said Mujib Rahman Rahimi, spokesman for Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, whose Jamiat-e-Islami party draws its support mainly from Tajiks.

“The time of betrayal of our language and culture is past. We will not allow anyone else to choose a name for our language,” he wrote on his personal Facebook page.

However not all reaction was negative and some other users supported the move, saying it reinforced Afghanistan’s national identity: “I am from Afghanistan, not Persia or the Persian race,” wrote one.

There was also no sign the reaction would harm the BBC’s ability to report or have major political repercussions in Afghanistan. Combined BBC services are estimated to reach about 6.6 million Afghans out of a total population of some 35 million, according to figures last year from the BBC Trust.

The head of the BBC’s Afghan service, Meena Baktash defended the use of the term Dari, noting that it was the official name of the language in Afghanistan.

She said the change was intended to link the Facebook page to the BBC Dari radio service, which was launched in 2003 and which, together with the BBC Pashto service, occupies an important place in the crowded local media landscape.

“There are absolutely no political and cultural reasons behind our decision,” she wrote in a statement on Facebook, which, as in other countries, has taken off in Afghanistan to become one of the main sources of news and comment.

Along with Pashto, the language of the Pashtuns, Dari is named in the constitution as one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

But many Afghan Persian speakers say their language is the same as the one spoken in Iran and Tajikistan and say the name Dari was favoured by past Pashtun leaders as a means of distancing Afghanistan from the Persian cultural sphere.

“The division of the Farsi language into Dari, Farsi and Tajiki is contrary to the reality of our common language and the vast expanse of our common culture and civilization,” Abdul Hai Khurasani, a scholar and former aide to the late Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud wrote in a letter to the director general of the BBC World Service which he posted on Facebook.",BBC name change stirs language row in Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1D50O1-OCAEN

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.
But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

TRADE DEFICITS

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

EMPEROR, ABDUCTEES

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

Matt Duchene, a nine-year veteran with Colorado, was pulled off the ice and traded to the Ottawa Senators in a three-team deal that was completed in the first period of the Avalanche’s 6-4 loss to the New York Islanders at Barclays Center on Sunday.

Duchene was selected by the Avalanche with the third overall pick for the 2009 draft and played 586 games for the franchise. The deal netted Colorado four players and three draft picks from the Senators and Nashville Predators, the latter of whom sent star center Kyle Turley to Ottawa.

Duchene, who played 1:59 Sunday, left the ice for the last time as a member of the Avalanche with 10:37 remaining in the period.

The Islanders were well on the way to their sixth win in eight games as Duchene packed his belongings. New York led 2-0 after the first period thanks to goals by Scott Mayfield and Jordan Eberle.

Hong Kong’s Kingboard Chemical Holdings (0148.HK) said it had sold the stake to Qatar Airways for HK$5.16 billion ($661 million), making the Middle Eastern carrier the third-largest shareholder in Cathay.

For Cathay, the Qatar stake will give it a third strategic shareholder behind Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK) and Air China Ltd (601111.SS), potentially complicating a restructuring plan aimed at slashing HK$4 billion in costs over three years.

Without domestic flights to underpin earnings, Asian carriers Cathay and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) have struggled against Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals, with Cathay already shedding 600 jobs since May.

For state-owned Qatar Airways, its first major stake in an Asian airline will allow it to boost its global influence and potentially increase traffic through its Doha hub, amid the worst political crisis in years among the Gulf Arab states.

The airline has been unable to fly to the previously lucrative markets of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of an airspace rights dispute with neighbors, and has been looking to invest elsewhere to broaden its reach.

It was rebuffed by American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) earlier this year.

Despite Cathay’s troubles, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker described it as “one of the strongest airlines in the world ... with massive potential for the future”.

Cathay shares have risen by 29.4 percent since the start of January despite the airline in August posting its worst first-half loss in 20 years.

Shares of Cathay Pacific dropped as much as 4.7 percent on Monday morning, as investors worried about its direction with Qatar Airways on its registry. The stock closed 1.5 percent lower, while the broader market was flat.

“Cathay will have three major shareholders, all with different and potentially conflicting interests - Swire, Air China and Qatar Airways,” said Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.

“This may not necessarily be favorable for Cathay as it is facing operating challenges and undergoing transformation.”

Swire Pacific owns 45 percent of Cathay and Air China 30 percent. Air China said on Monday that it viewed Qatar Airways’ purchase of the Cathay stake “positively” and that it hoped the shareholders could work together to find synergies.

Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said that while Qatar Airways’ investment in Cathay was likely to be passive, difficulties could arise if they tried to better integrate their hubs.

Cathay flew between Hong Kong and Qatar Airway’s Doha hub as part of a codeshare arrangement between 2014 and 2016, when the route was axed “for commercial reasons”.

Qatar Airways’ investment strategy has seen it acquire 20 percent of British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAG.L), 10 percent of South America’s LATAM Airlines Group SA LTM.SN and 49 percent of Italy’s Meridiana.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

Rising mining production should help ease some of the economic problems in Congo where inflation is expected to hit 48 percent this year and the Congolese franc has fallen by 22 percent against the dollar, largely due to lingering effects from two years of low commodity prices.

Copper production in the first nine months of the year stood at 831,000 tonnes, the central bank said in a monthly report, while cobalt production increased by 18 percent to 59,000 tonnes and gold production rose 5.7 percent to 23,000 kg.

But the bank warned that any letup by authorities on tight monetary policy and austerity measures that have reduced fiscal deficits in recent months could cause inflation and depreciation of the franc currency to spiral again.

It said the annual inflation rate could rise to as high as 76 percent by year-end if those policies are relaxed. The franc could fall further, by as much as 39 percent, if the policies are not maintained, the bank said.

Congo’s mining sector, which along with the smaller oil sector accounts for 95 percent of export revenues, has grown steadily since the end of a civil war in 2003, attracting investors like Glencore, Randgold Resources and China Molybdenum.

Congo’s economy has also been rattled by political upheaval caused by repeated delays since 2016 to an election to replace President Joseph Kabila. The country’s electoral commission postponed the vote again on Sunday to December 2018.

Government spending traditionally increases near the end of the year.

Mnangagwa’s removal provides a boost for Mugabe’s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.

“The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,” Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.

“It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.”

Mnangagwa’s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.

Grace, 52, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a “coup plotter” and a “coward” on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time.

The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war.

Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations.

FALLEN PROTEGE

The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation.

Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men.

FILE PHOTO: President Robert Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe looks on during a national church interface rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 5, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo

By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980.

However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence.

Mnangagwa’s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF.

Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa’s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

That Mnangagwa’s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship.

Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that Manafort has offered to pledge in exchange for lifting his house arrest restrictions, especially several life insurance policies that are held in trust and in his wife’s name.

Having a family member who is serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, she said, “is very problematic.”

Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with some of Trump’s campaign associates.

On Sunday, Mohammed bin Salman turned the same venue – the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh – into a posh detention center for princes, ministers and other elites rounded up in a sudden anti-corruption drive. It could do the likely next Saudi king’s ambitious economic and social reforms more harm than good.

Among those detained was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose investments in Citigroup, Twitter and other firms make him the most recognizable Saudi on Wall Street, along with another 10 princes. Four ministers were also held, Reuters reported, as was former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco director who rubbed elbows at the recent Future Investment Initiative shindig at the Ritz-Carlton with the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman.

Corruption may be a problem, but the weekend move also looks like a strike against potential opposition. The crown prince has vowed to take Saudi mores back to a time before 1979, when the seizure of the Grand Mosque by armed militants brought religious conservatives into control. Having charmed financiers at the event dubbed Davos in the desert with his vision for a $500 billion global city he calls NEOM, among other things, the crown prince may have felt emboldened to move rapidly.

The clampdown on perceived members of the old guard, many blessed with extraordinary birthright wealth, was seen favorably by many Saudis, according to Reuters. Though the domestic stock market initially sank 2.2 percent, it closed higher.

Yet Sunday’s purge raises more questions than it answers. Among them: What is the nature of the charges, and the evidence for them? Did a public spat with Donald Trump play a role in Prince Alwaleed’s arrest? Was the monarchy threatened with a coup, or was it a pre-emptive initiative?

More lastingly, the weekend’s events underline that Saudi is an absolute monarchy. That can mean whims, plots and retribution matter more than transparency and a predictable rule of law. The latter two are prerequisites for many global investors, like the ones in attendance at the Ritz-Carlton just days ago.

A empresa ressaltou, no entanto, que a região no pré-sal da Bacia de Santos pode ter excedentes ao volume estabelecido no contrato menores do que o apontado em uma projeção divulgada pela Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) na última sexta-feira.

A ANP divulgou dados segundo os quais há uma maior probabilidade de as reservas excedentes na região da cessão onerosa somarem pelo menos cerca de 6 bilhões de barris de petróleo equivalente.

“A Petrobras, baseando-se no grande volume de dados que adquiriu, construiu suas próprias estimativas dos volumes excedentes, cujos limites estatísticos superior e inferior são menores que aqueles divulgados pela ANP”, disse a estatal nesta segunda-feira.

Com isso, a Petrobras disse que vai complementar essa avaliação através de uma opinião da consultoria DeGolyer and MacNaughton, que estará disponível em aproximadamente 30 dias.

“A existência de volumes excedentes nas áreas sob Cessão Onerosa constitui oportunidade para ambas as partes, Governo e Petrobras, construírem um acordo relacionado ao ressarcimento à Petrobras no processo de Revisão do Contrato”, disse a Petrobras.

Segundo a companhia, a contratação da consultoria para avaliar as reservas excedentes visa “embasar uma eventual negociação”.

Os dados da ANP tiveram como base laudo da Gaffney, Cline & Associates.

A agência disse que a certificadora apontou 90 por cento de chance de o excedente da cessão onerosa ter cerca de 6 bilhões de barris ou mais. Haveria, ainda, 10 por cento de probabilidade de que a área tenha cerca de 15 bilhões de barris de óleo equivalente ou mais.

CESSÃO ONEROSA

O contrato de cessão onerosa entre Petrobras e União, assinado em 2010, deu à Petrobras o direito de produzir até 5 bilhões de barris em áreas do pré-sal.

A estatal pagou na época 42,5 bilhões de dólares ao governo federal pelo direito de explorar a região, mas estava prevista uma renegociação do contrato no futuro, após a declaração de comercialidade das áreas.

A Petrobras disse que, como resultado das atividades sob contrato da cessão onerosa, foram declaradas as comercialidades dos campos de Búzios, Sépia, Itapu, Sul de Lula, Sul de Sapinhoá, Norte e Sul de Berbigão, Norte e Sul de Sururu e Atapu.

“O início da produção comercial se dará no primeiro semestre de 2018”, disse a companhia no comunicado.

Segundo a Petrobras, após sete anos de atividades na região, com perfuração de mais de 50 poços e testes de produção de longa duração, “foi possível concluir que há volumes superiores aos 5 bilhões de barris equivalentes contratados originalmente.”

A companhia disse que, para dar suporte à revisão do contrato, havia contratado laudo da DeGolyer and MacNaughton, mas este não previa avaliação de cenários de volumes excedentes.

Nos últimos meses, a Petrobras vem cobrando da União uma revisão do contrato da cessão onerosa, com uma visão de que a companhia hoje seria credora do governo, devido à queda dos preços do petróleo desde o acordo original.

O governo, no entanto, tem dito que não há uma posição pacífica sobre a revisão do contrato favorecer a Petrobras.

Segundo as autoridades, as negociações entre as partes deveriam começar logo após a divulgação dos números da ANP sobre os excedentes na região da cessão onerosa.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen widened on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly held in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The arrests, which an official said were just “phase one” of the crackdown, are the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign also lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astonished that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.”

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel (1810.SE) plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing (4080.SE) and Red Sea International (4230.SE) separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

The allegations against the men include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

A royal decree on Saturday said the crackdown was launched in response to “exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money”.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

This season’s standout players both exited Stamford Bridge after frustrating periods under former manager Jose Mourinho, who recognised but failed to realise their potential.

De Bruyne and Salah each refocused their careers elsewhere in Europe before arriving back in the Premier League bristling with intent - at City and Liverpool respectively.

De Bruyne, in particular, has been instrumental in City’s astonishing start to a season in which they have scored 52 goals in all competitions.

The Belgian is no one-season wonder, however, and over the past five years only Barcelona’s Lionel Messi has recorded more assists in Europe’s top five leagues, with De Bruyne’s performances at City turbo-charged by Pep Guardiola’s arrival as manager.

On Saturday, he scored City’s opener in the 3-1 win over Arsenal, exchanging passes with Fernandinho before unleashing an angled drive into the bottom corner.

De Bruyne’s performances make Mourinho’s decision to ditch him from Chelsea after just 33 games in two years all the more questionable, although the Portuguese insisted he had his reasons.

“He was not training very well. He was saying: ‘I can’t give you more. This is just my way’,” said Mourinho when asked about the departure.

Salah received even less of a chance at Chelsea after arriving from Basel soon after De Bruyne left Stamford Bridge for Wolfsburg in January, 2014.

The Egyptian failed to make an impact in 12 months under Mourinho, moving to Fiorentina on loan as a makeweight in a deal in which Juan Cuadrado, another soon-to-be Chelsea misfit, headed the other way.

Salah’s switch proved the making of him and, after arriving at Anfield via Roma, the 25-year-old’s impact this season has been great. On Saturday he scored his 11th and 12th goals in 17 games, the best striking record by anyone at the club since Michael Owen in 2001-02, who also reached his 12-goal mark on Nov. 4 that season.

STRIKING GREAT

Not surprisingly, Salah’s rich scoring seam is delighting manager Juergen Klopp.

“I didn’t think if he can score 12 goals or whatever in 17 games,” the Liverpool coach said. “But I hope he’s not finished now!”

Owen ended with 28 goals in 43 appearances in 2002 and Salah, who needs just three more to beat last season’s Liverpool top scorer, Philippe Coutinho, could yet join another Reds great, Luis Suarez, as one of the few strikers to notch 30 goals in a season.

There is little doubt the presence of De Bruyne and Salah in Chelsea’s ranks would have improved their early results this season.

But perhaps both needed the disappointment of their Chelsea rejections to reach their current heights.

Watford’s Nathaniel Chalobah is another who quit the club this year only to be rewarded with an England call-up. Tammy Abraham, on loan at Swansea City, also made national manager Gareth Southgate’s squad after failing to break through at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is insistent that under his regime, all the club’s young talent has a pathway to the first team and points to his own record as Juventus manager where he nurtured Paul Pogba, who is now playing under Mourinho at Manchester United.

But for all Conte’s fine words, it is clear that De Bruyne and Salah were allowed to slip through the net at Chelsea, a mistake so costly it may stop the champions from successfully defending their title.",Soccer: Chelsea rejects blaze a trail through Premier League,https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-che-castoffs/soccer-chelsea-rejects-blaze-a-trail-through-premier-league-idINKBN1D6247?il=0

If approved, the budget would further damage the relationship between Baghdad and Erbil -- the semi-autonomous region’s capital -- already at boiling point after the central government launched a military offensive last month that swiftly recaptured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

A preliminary draft document seen by Reuters and confirmed by three lawmakers and two Iraqi government officials shows the Kurdistan region’s share of the 2018 budget trimmed to 12.6 percent, down from the 17 percent the region has traditionally been entitled to since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

The 12.6 percent figure was “very accurate”, said a government financial advisor on condition of anonymity, who said it was based on population data from the trade ministry’s ration card program.

Iraq’s central government and the Kurdish autonomous region have quarreled over money repeatedly since the 2003 fall of Saddam Hussein.

The post-Saddam constitution put in place a system guaranteeing the Kurds self-rule with a share of overall revenue proportionate to their share of the population.

For the past three years, Baghdad stopped sending funds while the Kurds held nearly all of northern Iraq’s oil infrastructure and sold enough crude to fund themselves.

But the Iraqi government offensive that recaptured oil-producing territory from the Kurds last month means the autonomous region is once again dependent on Baghdad for funds. The central government has demanded a halt to all independent Kurdish oil sales.

The reduced budget would dramatically add to the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) financial difficulties. The region says it is already stretched thin due to a three-year war on Islamic State and the cost of supporting hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the militants.

Last year, Iraq’s parliament approved the 2017 budget, but all members of the KDP party that rules the Kurdish region stayed away, protesting that the budget failed to allocate enough money for salaries of state workers and Peshmerga fighters, the Kurdish region’s security forces.

Another proposal inserted into the draft budget would see the central government distribute the Kurdish region’s share of the federal budget to the three provinces that make up the region individually, further undermining the KRG’s control over the allocation of funds.

“It’s a dangerous sign which indicates that Baghdad is seeking to undermine the political and economic system in Kurdistan region by cutting the budget share and dealing directly with the provinces,” said Ahmed Hama Rasheed, a Kurd and the secretary of the financial committee in the federal parliament.

”It seems that the central government is trying a divide and conquer policy with the Kurdistan region”, said Rasheed.

Kurdish officials criticized the cabinet proposals, accusing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of using the 2018 budget to punish the Kurds, who overwhelmingly voted to break away from Iraq in the referendum, which Baghdad considers illegal.

In a press conference on Monday, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said Baghdad had violated the Iraqi constitution by drafting a budget that does not recognize Kurdish entitlements.

Barzani, the nephew of Massoud Barzani who stepped down last week as Kurdish president in the wake of the referendum crisis, said the KRG was “prepared to give them the oil revenue” -- apparently an offer to negotiate over its own sales of oil -- if the central government was prepared to give the Kurds their customary 17 percent share.

The budget proposal with the revised trimmed share for the Kurds was rejected by two Kurdish ministers attending Sunday’s cabinet meeting, two Iraqi government officials confirmed.

Donna Brazile has written in a soon-to-be-published book that she thought about working to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after the nominee almost collapsed at an event on Sept. 11, 2016.

In an interview on Sunday with ABC’s “This Week,” Brazile said she had supported Clinton but felt under pressure to come up with a “Plan B” after the candidate collapsed and many people were calling the DNC to ask about the incident.

“I wanted her to win, but we were under pressure,” Brazile said. “For those who are telling me to shut up ... you know what I tell them? Go to hell. I‘m going to tell my story.”

Her book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that put Donald Trump in the White House,” is set for release on Tuesday by Hachette Books.

About 100 former Clinton campaign staffers have signed an open letter saying they were shocked to learn in Brazile’s upcoming book that she considered trying to replace both Clinton and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine.

Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016.

She nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Her doctor said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, and she took several days off from campaigning.

Brazile’s comments on ABC revealed tensions with Clinton’s campaign staff. ”I got sick and tired of people trying to tell me how to spend money,“ she said. ” ... I wasn’t getting a salary. I was basically volunteering my time.

“I‘m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile said, referring to a character in the film “12 Years a Slave.”

But Brazile said she had found no evidence that the Democratic primaries were rigged, a comment at odds with an article she wrote in Politico this week saying the process had been fixed in favor of Clinton, who had signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015.

Prince Mohammed’s reforms include a plan to list parts of giant state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco next year, with higher oil prices seen as beneficial for the market capitalization of the future listed company.

The news spurred concerns of Middle Eastern money pulling out of global financial markets. A weekend call by China’s central bank governor for tougher financial regulation also hit global investor sentiment.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.2 percent higher. Saudi Arabia’s own stock market fell as much as 1.5 percent before ending 0.1 percent higher, boosted in part by buying by government-linked funds.

Sentiment towards the U.S. dollar was still positive with leveraged funds paring bearish bets to be net long for the first time since late July.

“There is some ongoing adjustment in market expectations on the dollar’s outlook on the progress of the U.S. tax bill and on the ongoing Saudi situation but market moves have been in narrow ranges,” said Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments in London.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.
“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.
But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now.

North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan.

Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”.

Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.

“He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,“ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. ”The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.”

Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”.

Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles.

Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target.

The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade.

“Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”.

“Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added.

North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table, saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”.

“We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said.

TRADE DEFICITS

Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.

“America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I‘m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.”

Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware.

But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”.

Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016.

Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger.

In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues.

The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement.

Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office.

The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States.

Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe.

He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”.

“I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”

Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely.

Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic - GF20000107877

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal.

“Government of Afghanistan isn’t going to ban any social media platforms. WhatsApp and Telegram to continue operating in Afghanistan,” Javid Faisal, deputy spokesman to government Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah wrote on Twitter.

The row over instant messaging services began after a letter from Afghanistan’s telecoms regulator to Internet service providers telling them to block the services “without delay” was circulated on social media platforms last week.

WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, has more than a billion users worldwide. Telegram is a much smaller but fast growing instant messaging service that is popular in a number of countries including Afghanistan.

The acting minister for telecommunications said last week that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received from consumers.

Afghan media have reported that Afghanistan’s National Directorate for Security (NDS) wanted the ban to stop the Taliban and other insurgent groups from using encrypted messages. The NDS has not commented.

Throughout the controversy, the messaging platforms appeared to have continued to function normally in Afghanistan.

The episode, which attracted criticism from civil rights groups and furious comments on social media, underlined the importance Internet and mobile services of all kinds have gained in Afghanistan, notably among government officials themselves.","Afghanistan will not block WhatsApp, Telegram: spokesman",https://in.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-will-not-block-whatsapp-telegram-spokesman-idINKBN1D61V5

And the trucking industry is recovering after a tough few years, making struggling firms more likely to sell, Dan Clark, transportation finance head at BMO Harris Bank, the largest U.S. truck-financing arm.

XPO Logistics Inc (XPO.N) Chief Executive Officer Brad Jacobs said last week the company has a war chest of up to $8 billion for possible deals in the coming months, and has narrowed its target list to dozens of companies.

XPO has used rapid-fire acquisitions to grow from a small truck brokerage into a diversified company. In a 2015 buying spree of roughly $6.5 billion, it snagged trucking and logistics firm Con-way for $3 billion as well as France’s Norbert Dentressangle for $3.53 billion.

Scott Wheeler, chief financial officer at Daseke Inc (DSKE.O), which hauls industrial equipment for customers like Caterpillar (CAT.N) and Deere & Co (DE.N) on flatbed and specialized trailers, said acquisitions will fuel the company’s rapid growth. Daseke, with a market value of $597 million, has closed four deals in 2017 with more due before year-end. “There is so much opportunity,” said Wheeler, whose finance team is evaluating numerous merger targets with well-managed fleets and revenue of $40 million to $250 million. Daseke is the largest carrier in the $133 billion open-deck and specialized trucking niche, yet still has less than one percent of this fragmented market.

In August, Green Bay, Wisconsin-based Schneider National Inc (SNDR.N) told analysts the company plans to focus on “specialty areas” for acquisitions.

Echo Global Logistics (ECHO.O), with a market value of $664 million, has an “active pipeline” of so-called tuck-in deals aimed at strengthening a particular division that they are working on, CEO Douglas Waggoner told investors.

Financial data provider Preqin said year-to-date North American fundraising for private equity funds that include logistics as part of a wider focus has hit $11.6 billion, compared to $7.5 billion for all of 2016. The top funds in that sector either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on their investment plans.

Companies like Schneider and Covenant Transportation Group Inc (CVTI.O), which provides long-haul services, have used electronic logs for years and backed the rule. But the mandate could sap productivity by 3 percent to 15 percent, according to industry estimates.

Trucking firms have also had to raise driver pay as they struggle to attract and retain drivers amid a general driver shortage and tight U.S. labor markets, which has also pressured margins.

In addition, many owners of family-owned truck firms that launched following industry deregulation, which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes from 1980, have hit or are approaching retirement age with children pursuing different careers.

For many, their options are sell out, or shut down.

“It’s (the pace of acquisitions) been as busy as we’ve seen it since we started the business 13 years ago,” said Jim Parham, managing partner Florida-based M&A advisory firm Transport Capital Partners.

“We expect this pace to continue, if not accelerate, in the coming months,” Parham said.

Parham hopes to close four deals between firms with revenue of between $10 million to $250 million in the coming weeks but declined to provide specifics.

In February, Parham helped less-than-truckload carrier Central Freight Lines buy Wilson Trucking Corp out of Waco, Texas, another LTL carrier, to expand into the U.S. Southeast. LTL carriers consolidate smaller freight loads onto a single truck.

QUALITY AN ISSUE

Some privately held carriers are focused on building out their own fleet rather than buying other firms.

Brad Pinchuk, CEO of Dubuque, Iowa-based Hirschbach Motor Lines, said finding companies to buy that match his modern fleet and low annual driver turnover is tough. He has pursued aggressive expansion, nearly tripling his fleet since 2013 to around 1,100 trucks.

Pinchuk says the outlook for family-owned truck firms is bleak because major customers want a handful of big suppliers.

“Our big customers are getting bigger and they are doing business with fewer transportation providers,” Pinchuk said. “That makes it pretty darn tough for a small guy to do business directly with a large shipper.”

Certain niche, higher-margin truckers may be targeted by private equity firms, said Capstone’s McMahon.

For example, Magnate Worldwide, a joint venture between private equity firms CIVC Partners LP and Magnate Capital Partners, acquired New York-based fine art shipper Masterpiece International in April for an undisclosed sum.",U.S. truck firms accelerate into the merging lane,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trucking-m-a/u-s-truck-firms-accelerate-into-the-merging-lane-idUSKBN1D61EC

The world’s biggest bike and scooter market with 18 million in the year to last March, India accounts for less than 2 percent of Harley’s global sales but is now a production location for its popular Street 750 bike and a promising generator of growth as U.S. demand slows.

Harley was the first major player in the country’s big bike market - defined as those with engines above 601cc - and controls 60 percent of a segment that has almost tripled in size since 2014 and is expected to double again in the next 4-5 years.

With the arrival of Royal Enfield, however, it faces a locally-owned distribution network that dwarfs Harley’s roughly 30 outlets by a multiple of 24.

Were Enfield to ship even 10 of its new big bikes to each of its about 700 locations, it could double Harley’s 3,700 in annual sales.

A day before the new bike’s launch, Royal Enfield on Monday unveiled a 650cc twin engine, putting it on track to compete squarely with the Street 750.

India-based industry analysts and commentators say that Harley’s distribution network in India must be expanded if it is to deal with the new competition and rising demand from the country’s 1 billion plus consumers.

“Having outlet numbers in the mid twenties is clearly a thin distribution spread,” SBICAP Securities analyst Mahantesh Sabarad said.

“India has over 30 10-million-plus cities and each such city needs 2-3 dealerships to cater to a budding market of bike enthusiasts.”

The logo of Royal Enfield is pictured on a bike at Royal Enfield's flagship shore in Bangkok, Thailand, February 24, 2016. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha

Asked about the new bike last month, Harley Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told Reuters that he would not dismiss a competitor’s strengths but that he had faith in Harley’s brand and would not be changing strategy.

THIN DISTRIBUTION

Popular enthusiasm for commuting bikes in India’s densely populated city streets provides a far larger rider base than in western markets where Harley sells most of its bikes.

Harley plans to increase its network but is cautious about undermining its premium brand and has had problems with complaints about bike servicing in India in the past.

“The specific plans and the rate at which we (expand) is a function of finding a big enough market area and a really competent dealer that can make the investments to have the brand experience that we want to have for riders,” Levatich said.

“So that’s part of the formula, which will naturally make it probably slower and less dense than most of our competitors will do. But that’s our strategy and we are sticking to it.”

Royal Enfield’s new bike - to be unveiled in Milan on Tuesday - is expected to retail at around rupees 300,000 ($4,640) compared to Harley’s Street 750 at more than 500,000 rupees.

Other Harley executives say they feel confident that it will remain a brand Indians will look up to.

“When it comes to wooing those riders from Royal Enfield to Harley Davidson, we have a track record of that now since we have been in India,” said Marc McAllister, Harley’s managing director for international markets.

Eagles 51, Broncos 23

Carson Wentz threw four touchdown passes, Jay Ajayi rushed for a 46-yard score and the Philadelphia Eagles won their seventh consecutive game by routing the Denver Broncos 51-23.

The Eagles improved to 8-1, the best mark in the National Football League.

Wentz became the youngest player to throw at least 23 touchdown passes through nine games since Dan Marino had 27 in 1984.

The reeling Broncos fell to 3-5 and 0-4 on the road.

Denver started Brock Osweiler but the change provided little momentum as Osweiler struggled and finished 18 of 37 for 207 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

Saints 30, Buccaneers 10

Rookie running back Alvin Kamara scored two touchdowns and accounted for 152 yards and a rejuvenated New Orleans defense held Tampa Bay out of the end zone for 53 minutes in their sixth consecutive victory.

The Saints (6-2) knocked Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston out of the game late in the first half.

Ryan Fitzpatrick replaced Winston but he could not generate any offense as Tampa Bay (2-6) lost its fifth consecutive game.

Tensions ran high in the third quarter when Winston, out of the game, pushed Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore. When Lattimore turned around, Tampa Bay receiver Mike Evans slammed him, sparking a brief brawl. Evans was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.

Cowboys 28, Chiefs 17

Dallas turned to quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receivers Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley to defeat Kansas City.

Prescott completed 21 of 33 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns, with Williams collecting nine catches for 141 yards and Beasley making two touchdown catches.

Any chance for a comeback by the Chiefs (6-3) ended when Dallas safety Jeff Heath intercepted Alex Smith.

Ezekiel Elliott led the Cowboys (5-3) in rushing with 93 yards on 27 carries with a touchdown.

- - -

Panthers 20, Falcons 17

Christian McCaffrey and Cam Newton scored on short touchdown runs as the Panthers (6-3) wiped out an early 10-0 hole to Atlanta (4-4) to win for the second week.

Newton completed 13 of 24 passes for 137 yards. He was the game’s leading rusher with 86 yards on nine carries.

Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was 24 of 38 for 313 yards and two touchdowns.

Titans 23, Ravens 20

Taking advantage of two short fields and a clutch drive, Tennessee (5-3) edged Baltimore (4-5) to remain tied with Jacksonville for first place in the AFC South.

The Titans managed just one first down in its first four possessions of the second half. But their defense carried the load after intermission, allowing just a three-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco to Javorius Allen with 8:56 left.

Marcus Mariota completed 19 of 28 passes for 218 yards and a pair of scores with an interception.

Jaguars 23, Bengals 7

Jacksonville (5-3) utilized a quality defensive effort and an efficient outing from quarterback Blake Bortles for their first win at home as they defeated Cincinnati.

Cornerback Jaydon Mickens returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown with 14:35 left in the fourth quarter to ensure the win.

Jacksonville’s defense held the Bengals (3-5) to 148 yards and Bortles completed 24 of 38 passes for 259 yards with a touchdown.

Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey and Cincinnati receiver A.J. Green were both ejected in the final seconds of the first half.

Ramsey shoved Green and the seventh-year veteran grabbed Ramsey by the neck and slammed him to the ground. Green then delivered several punches and benches cleared.

Rams 51, Giants 17

Quarterback Jared Goff threw four touchdown passes, including three in the first half as Los Angeles (6-2) steamrolled New York (1-7).

The 51 points represented the most the Giants have given up in a home game since Sept. 19, 1999, when Washington scored 50.

Slideshow (6 Images)

The Rams scored on five of their first six possessions in the first half, with two of their scoring drives set up by turnovers.

Goff was 14 of 22 passing for 311 yards.

Giants quarterback Eli Manning became the seventh player in NFL history to pass for 50,000 yards.

Redskins 17, Seahawks 14

Rob Kelley scored on a one-yard touchdown run with 59 seconds left to cap a 70-yard drive and give Washington (4-4) the victory at Seattle (5-3)

Russell Wilson had hit Doug Baldwin with a 30-yard touchdown pass to put Seattle up 14-10 with 1:34 remaining.

Colts 20, Texans 14

Jacoby Brissett and T.Y. Hilton connected on a pair of long scoring strikes and Indianapolis snapped a three-game losing skid.

The Colts (3-6) held on late, with linebacker Jabaal Sheard recording a sack and forcing fumble on Texans quarterback Tom Savage on the final play from the Colts 7-yard line with seven seconds left.

Houston, playing without injured Deshaun Watson, dropped to 3-5.

Cardinals 20, 49ers 10

Adrian Peterson rushed for 159 yards on a career-high 37 carries to lead Arizona past winless San Francisco.

Drew Stanton passed for 283 yards and two touchdowns in his first start of the season for Arizona (4-4).

The 49ers dropped to 0-9.

Raiders 27, Dolphins 24

Derek Carr passed for 300 yards and Marshawn Lynch ran for two touchdowns as Oakland defeated Miami.

Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam, and four men who are still at large, have been charged in the murder of the half-brother of the country’s leader, using banned chemical weapon VX at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers have said Siti Aisyah and Huong were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality TV show.

The four suspects, who were caught on airport camera talking to the women before they attacked Kim Jong Nam, were identified as North Koreans for the first time on Monday, a month since the trial began.

Three of them were seen meeting a North Korean embassy official and the Air Koryo official, both unidentified, at the main airport terminal within an hour of the attack, lead police investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz told the court.

North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said.

Footage played in the courtroom showed the Air Koryo official helping the three suspects at an airport check-in counter. He was later seen arranging a flight ticket for the fourth suspect too, Wan Azirul said.

Wan Azirul identified the men as North Koreans Hong Song Hac, Ri Ji Hyon, Ri Jae Nam and O Jong Gil, citing intelligence findings by the special branch of the Malaysian police.

Wan Azirul said he investigated and took statements from both the embassy and the Air Koryo official.

“They explained that the reason they were there was to assist every North Korean individual or citizen who boarded a flight to leave the country,” he told the court.

The North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not respond to Reuters’ telephone calls and emails to seek comment.

The sensational murder unraveled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea.

Malaysia was forced to return Kim Jong Nam’s body and allow the return home of three North Korean men wanted for questioning and hiding in the Kuala Lumpur embassy, in exchange for the release of nine Malaysians stuck in Pyongyang.

Wan Azirul said police intelligence also provided information on a fifth suspect identified as Ri Ji U, who was also “suspected to have the real name James”, based on images and photographs taken from Siti Aisyah’s phone.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

The last such national strike by doctors was more than 20 years ago, said Faustus Kavuma of the Uganda Medical Association, although local strikes are frequent.

“The lack of supplies and equipment in the hospitals ... should stop,” he said. “Our remuneration is very poor.”

He said doctors lacked necessities like gloves, painkillers and disinfectant. An entry-level doctor in public healthcare in Uganda earns about 1.1 million shillings ($300) per month. A senior physician takes home about 3.4 million.

The union wants that raised that to 8.5 million and 45 million shillings respectively, Kavuma said.

The strike will fuel public disillusionment with President Yoweri Museveni’s government, already facing anger over a plan to extend his 31-year rule.

Museveni, 73, is currently barred from running in the next polls in 2021 because the constitution imposes an age ceiling of 75 for candidates. The ruling party is seeking to scrap the cap, with the president’s backing.

The move has provoked protests that have been put down with tear gas and live ammunition. At least two people have been killed.

Diana Atwine, permanent secretary at the ministry of health, told Reuters the government was willing to raise doctors’ salaries and address their other concerns but they should be patient.

“The problem requires a comprehensive approach because it’s not only medical doctors that are not well paid. All civil servants are not well paid,” she said.

A committee had been instituted, she said, to asssess all public workers’ pay and make recommendations.

Last month, the government gave lawmakers an extra one-off payment of $8,000 to hold consultations on the bill to extend the president’s rule.

Eric Daniels, the most senior executive to take the stand in a trial where 6,000 shareholders are claiming around 550 million pounds in damages over the takeover, told London’s High Court that although he was aware that HBOS could be nationalised if the Lloyds deal did not go ahead, the bank only acted in the interests of shareholders.

“I did not look at it as a rescue,” Daniels said, while being cross-examined by a lawyer for the claimants.

Lloyds’ takeover of HBOS in September 2008 came at a moment of high crisis for its rival, whose share price had plunged following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and concerns about its exposure to bad loans.

The deal valued HBOS at around 5.9 billion pounds. But as the economic recession deepened in the wake of the credit crisis, Lloyds itself had to be rescued with a 20.5 billion-pound government bailout in 2009.

Daniels, who led Lloyds from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the takeover, is one of five former directors who, along with the bank itself, shareholders allege concealed crucial information about HBOS’s financial circumstances and breached their duties by recommending the reverse takeover in 2008.

“This was something we would do only for the benefit of our shareholders, we were not a charitable institution ... we’ve got a foundation for that,” Daniels said.

Britain’s largest retail bank and the individual defendants, who also include ex-chairman Victor Blank, former finance director Tim Tookey and Helen Weir and Truett Tate, the former heads of retail and wholesale banking respectively, deny any wrongdoing.

Lloyds is defending itself and its former executives against the claim.

The shareholders also allege that Lloyds should have told its investors about a 10 billion-pound loan it had extended to HBOS and emergency support its rival was receiving from the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve - information their lawyer has said showed HBOS was a “bust, failed bank”.

NATIONALISATION

Daniels said that around Sept. 17, 2008 the governor of the Bank of England at the time, Mervyn King, told him HBOS could face nationalisation if the takeover did not go ahead, confirming wide speculation in the market of this possibility.

But it was the funding issues HBOS was facing that provided a possible route towards a takeover, he told the court. The government had already suggested competition hurdles could be circumvented if the deal was done quickly.

The lawyer for the shareholders, Richard Hill, has alleged that Lloyds agreed to pay a significant premium to HBOS’s market value and trading share price when its struggling rival was in fact “worthless”.

Daniels said while the aim was to pay as little as possible the bank had to balance this with the need to convince HBOS’s board and shareholders that they should approve the takeover.

“I would have enjoyed greatly paying less,” he said.

The court’s decision means Puigdemont, who left Spain last month after Madrid fired his secessionist government and dissolved the Catalan parliament, is free to campaign for independence in an election in the region on Dec 21.

Puigdemont said on Monday his government’s actions were legitimate and criticized the Spanish judicial system for a “clear lack of independence and neutrality”.

The December vote is shaping up to be a de facto independence referendum.

Puigdemont’s PDeCAT and another secessionist party said at the weekend they might run on a combined ticket, but would need to make a decision on any formal alliance - which might also include other parties - by a deadline of Tuesday.

Alliances could however also form after the election.

The independence push has dragged Spain into its worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. It has deeply divided the country, fuelling anti-Spanish feelings in Catalonia and nationalist tendencies elsewhere.

Puigdemont turned himself in to Belgian police on Sunday along with four of his ex-ministers, after Spain issued a European arrest warrant on charges of rebellion as well as misuse of public funds.

All five are barred from leaving Belgium without a judge’s consent.

They will appear before a Belgian court on Nov. 17 for a hearing to discuss the arrest warrant, prosecutors in Brussels said in a statement.

CALL FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION

Puigdemont, writing in Britain’s Guardian newspaper, called for scrutiny of the Spanish judicial system and said the crisis could be solved only with a political and not a judicial solution.

“Does anyone think that the sacked Catalan government can expect a fair and independent hearing, uninfluenced by political and media pressure? I do not,” he wrote.

Spain’s central government took control of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, after local leaders held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 despite a Constitutional Court ban.

The region’s parliament then passed a unilateral declaration of independence. In response, Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy fired the government and called the snap regional elections.

Eight of Puigdemont’s allies stayed behind in Spain and have been detained on similar accusations to the ones the deposed leader faces.

On Sunday, the first part of a GAD3 survey showed that pro-independence parties would win the election in Catalonia but may not gain the parliamentary majority needed to continue with secession.

On Monday, the second part showed just one in seven people in the region believe the current standoff between Barcelona and Madrid will end in independence, while more than two thirds think the process has been bad for the economy.

Published in La Vanguardia newspaper, that survey polled 1,233 people between Oct. 30 and Nov. 3.

Optimism that a negotiated solution would be found was low, with just over a fifth of respondents thinking the crisis would lead to talks between regional authorities and Madrid.

The House tax-writing committee begins revising the bill on Monday with tweaks and some more substantial changes expected to a number of individual and corporate tax proposals.

House Republicans last week unveiled the first draft of a 429-page tax bill that, if enacted, would be the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s.

It proposes a range of tax cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishing a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which are currently taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent.

House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox New Sunday that there are a “host of ideas” being considered as lawmakers begin revising the bill, though he expected the broad outlines to remain the same.

One controversial component for lawmakers from high-tax states repeals a popular federal tax deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments, while preserving a deduction for property tax payments, capped at $10,000 per year.

House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady worked out a compromise last week that preserved the deduction for property taxes after pushback from Republicans representing states such as New Jersey, New York and California, which would be disproportionately hit by the repeal.

States that would be hit hard by the elimination of a SALT deduction have enough Republican members in Congress to derail the tax legislation. Many have already said they would like to see the cap raised on the property-tax deduction or the income-tax deduction retained.

The Senate is developing its own version of the legislation and it would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to President Donald Trump.

On Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Vice President Mike Pence called the House bill a “great start.”

“We look forward to the Senate bringing forward the tax cut, the key here is that whatever is accomplished reflects the President’s commitment to cutting taxes on working families,” said Pence, who would be the tie-breaker if needed in a Senate vote.

If Republicans pass tax legislation, it will be the first major legislative achievement since Republicans took control of the White House and Congress in January - and a rebound from their failure to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

The library of the university KU Leuven ""Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"" is pictured in Leuven, Belgium, June 8, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The art works are from a massive trove amassed by collector Hildebrand Gurlitt, who was enlisted by the Nazis to sell the works. His son, Cornelius, inherited the collection and when he died in 2014 he stunned the Kunst Museum Bern by naming it the sole heir to all 1,500 works. The museum in Switzerland's capital has now put together this exhibition, ""Degenerate Art - Confiscated and Sold"", amid lingering questions about the collection's origins. The museum's director Nina Zimmer says they've taken a cautious approach. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BERN MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS DIRECTOR, NINA ZIMMER, SAYING: ""To be totally sure, we have only took in our possession one third of the works in this exhibition where we are a 100 percent sure it's not looted, and the other two thirds, we are waiting for like final little details to clarify their status, and we currently don't see any suspicion of any such exceptional cases of looted art within this group of works."" German tax inspectors confiscated Cornelius Gurlitt's trove of art works during a tax evasion probe, but it was returned to him when he agreed to cooperate with authorities investigating the work's provenance. Some 150 artworks make up the Swiss exhibition including pieces from leading German artists of the 1920s and 30s that Adolf Hitler banned. The museum believes it gives people the chance to have a close look at Nazi politics towards art and artists.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

Negotiators emerged on Monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit-speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development.

After discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to Merkel’s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date.

Merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national elections must forge a so-called “Jamaica” coalition - named because the three camps’ colors match that country’s flag - that is untested at national level.

Other members of the consortium include Norwegian oil firm Statoil, trading houses Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria, and banks ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale.

Blockchain technology, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, uses a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.

Mercuria has been a vocal advocate of implementing blockchain technology to significantly cut costs in oil trading.

“Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,” said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC.

Similar efforts for an energy trading platform have failed to take off, Bell said, but added this latest bid with backing from BP and Shell and the banks, “may have more success than if it were an independent party trying to convince oil and gas companies to make use of it.”

The new venture is seeking regulatory approvals and would be run as an independent entity, the consortium said in a statement.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

City took their goals tally in all competitions so far this season to 52 as Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero and substitute Gabriel Jesus ensured a ninth successive league win.

Alexandre Lacazette did pull a goal back for Arsenal but Arsene Wenger’s side are now 12 points adrift in sixth spot.

Jose Mourinho’s third competitive visit back to old club Chelsea after being sacked three years ago ended in a third defeat as Alvaro Morata’s first goal since September sealed victory for the champions at Stamford Bridge.

Morata headed the winner in the 55th minute.

Tottenham Hotspur’s Son Heung-min became the Asian player with the most Premier League goals ever as he scored in the 64th minute to secure a 1-0 home win over bottom club Crystal Palace.

It was his 20th top flight goal, surpassing the mark of former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung.

Spurs are on 23 points from 11 games, the same as United, with City racing away at the top with 31. Champions Chelsea are fourth with 22, followed by Liverpool and Arsenal on 19.

For pure drama, however, Goodison Park was the place to be as Everton clawed back a two-goal deficit against Watford to win 3-2 with a Leighton Baines penalty in stoppage time.

Watford then had a penalty of their own with 101 minutes on the clock but Tom Cleverley missed it, meaning Everton won a top flight game from two goals down for the first time since 1994.

Victory snapped a run of five successive defeats in all competitions for Everton and took them out of the relegation zone up to 15th -- leaving West Ham United in the bottom three along with Swansea City and Crystal Palace.

“We’ve done it the hard way, but showed incredible spirit and fight,” Everton’s caretaker manager David Unsworth said after his first victory since taking charge of the team following the sacking of Ronald Koeman.

City were not at their electrifying best against Arsenal but still had too much for Arsene Wenger’s side.

De Bruyne fired home after 19 minutes and Aguero made it 2-0 five minutes after the break with a penalty awarded when Raheem Sterling tumbled under a soft challenge by Nacho Monreal.

There was also a suspicion of offside about City’s third goal which killed off Arsenal’s hopes of salvaging something.

“You can accept it if City win in a normal way, but this is unacceptable,” Wenger said.

Guardiola’s side go into the international break in a dominant position in the league having already beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.

“Last season against the title contenders, we were able to win just twice,” Guardiola said.

“This season in November, we are already winning three times. If you want to win the title, you have to beat Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the other teams at the top.”

United were disappointing after the break against Chelsea and two defeats in three league matches has seriously dented their hopes of reeling in their close neighbours.

“We are second, not fifth or sixth and we have 18 teams in a more difficult position than us,” Mourinho said.

“Eight points is eight points but we’ve been through a difficult phase with matches against Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea without important players.”

Victory was a welcome boost for Chelsea boss Antonio Conte after his side were humbled 3-0 by Roma in midweek and according to the Italian proved the spirit is back.

”This type of win is important for our confidence. We showed great desire and passion to win this kind of game.

The subject’s inclusion on the monthly meeting’s agenda of EU finance ministers came after weekend media reports citing the so-called “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents leaked mostly from Appleby, a prominent offshore law firm.

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified them. Appleby was not immediately available for comment.

The latest revelations “put renewed emphasis on the work the European Commission is doing to fight tax avoidance”, the vice president of the EU’s executive arm, Valdis Dombrovskis, told reporters on Monday.

EU countries had planned for months to reach an agreement on a blacklist for tax havens by the end of this year. The new revelations prompted the discussion to be brought forward, EU officials said, but no final decision was expected on Tuesday.

The EU has discussed several measures to crack down on tax avoidance, including in the wake of the “Panama Papers”, a release by the ICIJ last year which chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Measures proposed by the European Commission include an EU-wide list of tax havens meant to discourage the rerouting of profits made in the EU to tax-free or low-tax countries, like Panama or Bermuda.

At the moment, each EU state has its own list of jurisdictions that are seen as less cooperative on tax matters. Criteria to define a tax haven vary greatly among EU states and some of them omit any jurisdictions in their national blacklists.

ONE-COUNTRY LIST?

An EU-wide blacklist is believed to carry more weight. Jurisdictions included in the list could be subject to sanctions if they did not cooperate.

“It’s time that we agree and publish a blacklist on tax havens,” EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters, calling for a “credible” list and “adequate sanctions” when serious breaches are unveiled.

There are no details yet of the type of sanctions that could be imposed, although being on the blacklist in itself could discourage individuals and companies from putting money in those jurisdictions.

Moscovici added that the EU blacklist should be more ambitious than the existing list of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations that has so far been leading the fight against tax avoidance.

The OECD list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax transparency includes to date only Trinidad and Tobago.

Some EU countries remain skeptical about the blacklist and are themselves under scrutiny for unfair tax competition.

Smaller EU states, like Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, attract firms with lower corporate taxes. Some have been sanctioned for deals with multinationals that slashed their tax bills, reducing revenues in other EU states.

To win over their resistance, the proposed EU blacklist would apply only to non-EU countries. Also, states which charge no corporate taxes will not be automatically considered tax havens, under a preliminary deal reached by EU finance ministers last year.

On tax matters the EU can take decisions only with the unanimous backing of its 28 member states, unless extraordinary procedures are launched - an option never tested so far.

To reduce the appeal of tax havens, Brussels has also proposed the setting up of public registries that would show the real owners of companies, which are often hidden by frontmen in shell firms in offshore jurisdictions.

It has also proposed compulsory reporting by large multinational firms of profits made and taxes paid in each state where they operate, in a bid to show how much of their revenues are booked in low-tax countries.

EU states have long been discussing both proposals, but no deal has been reached yet. “EU governments such as Germany have been standing against the rising tide of financial transparency,” said Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International EU.",EU to discuss tax havens blacklist after 'Paradise Papers' leaks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ecofin-taxavoidance/eu-to-discuss-tax-havens-blacklist-after-paradise-papers-leaks-idINKBN1D618S?il=0

The world’s biggest bike and scooter market with 18 million in the year to last March, India accounts for less than 2 percent of Harley’s global sales but is now a production location for its popular Street 750 bike and a promising generator of growth as U.S. demand slows.

Harley was the first major player in the country’s big bike market - defined as those with engines above 601cc - and controls 60 percent of a segment that has almost tripled in size since 2014 and is expected to double again in the next 4-5 years.

With the arrival of Royal Enfield, however, it faces a locally-owned distribution network that dwarfs Harley’s roughly 30 outlets by a multiple of 24.

Were Enfield to ship even 10 of its new big bikes to each of its about 700 locations, it could double Harley’s 3,700 in annual sales.

A day before the new bike’s launch, Royal Enfield on Monday unveiled a 650cc twin engine, putting it on track to compete squarely with the Street 750.

India-based industry analysts and commentators say that Harley’s distribution network in India must be expanded if it is to deal with the new competition and rising demand from the country’s 1 billion plus consumers.

“Having outlet numbers in the mid twenties is clearly a thin distribution spread,” SBICAP Securities analyst Mahantesh Sabarad said.

“India has over 30 10-million-plus cities and each such city needs 2-3 dealerships to cater to a budding market of bike enthusiasts.”

Asked about the new bike last month, Harley Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told Reuters that he would not dismiss a competitor’s strengths but that he had faith in Harley’s brand and would not be changing strategy.

THIN DISTRIBUTION

Popular enthusiasm for commuting bikes in India’s densely populated city streets provides a far larger rider base than in western markets where Harley sells most of its bikes.

Harley plans to increase its network but is cautious about undermining its premium brand and has had problems with complaints about bike servicing in India in the past.

“The specific plans and the rate at which we (expand) is a function of finding a big enough market area and a really competent dealer that can make the investments to have the brand experience that we want to have for riders,” Levatich said.

“So that’s part of the formula, which will naturally make it probably slower and less dense than most of our competitors will do. But that’s our strategy and we are sticking to it.”

Royal Enfield’s new bike - to be unveiled in Milan on Tuesday - is expected to retail at around rupees 300,000 ($4,640) compared to Harley’s Street 750 at more than 500,000 rupees.

Other Harley executives say they feel confident that it will remain a brand Indians will look up to.

“When it comes to wooing those riders from Royal Enfield to Harley Davidson, we have a track record of that now since we have been in India,” said Marc McAllister, Harley’s managing director for international markets.

“India has over 30 10-million-plus cities and each such city needs 2-3 dealerships to cater to a budding market of bike enthusiasts.”

Asked about the new bike last month, Harley Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told Reuters that he would not dismiss a competitor’s strengths but that he had faith in Harley’s brand and would not be changing strategy.

THIN DISTRIBUTION

Popular enthusiasm for commuting bikes in India’s densely populated city streets provides a far larger rider base than in western markets where Harley sells most of its bikes.

Harley plans to increase its network but is cautious about undermining its premium brand and has had problems with complaints about bike servicing in India in the past.

“The specific plans and the rate at which we (expand) is a function of finding a big enough market area and a really competent dealer that can make the investments to have the brand experience that we want to have for riders,” Levatich said.

“So that’s part of the formula, which will naturally make it probably slower and less dense than most of our competitors will do. But that’s our strategy and we are sticking to it.”

Royal Enfield’s new bike - to be unveiled in Milan on Tuesday - is expected to retail at around rupees 300,000 ($4,640) compared to Harley’s Street 750 at more than 500,000 rupees.

Other Harley executives say they feel confident that it will remain a brand Indians will look up to.

“When it comes to wooing those riders from Royal Enfield to Harley Davidson, we have a track record of that now since we have been in India,” said Marc McAllister, Harley’s managing director for international markets.

Saudi King Salman received Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Riyadh on Monday, two days after he quit, Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television reported, without elaborating.

In a televised speech, Hariri had said he feared an assassination plot against him and accused Iran along with its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world.

His resignation stunned Beirut’s political establishment, brought down the coalition government and sparked a new political crisis. It has thrust Lebanon into the front line of the regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Muslim Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

The world’s biggest bike and scooter market with 18 million in the year to last March, India accounts for less than 2 percent of Harley’s global sales but is now a production location for its popular Street 750 bike and a promising generator of growth as U.S. demand slows.

Harley was the first major player in the country’s big bike market - defined as those with engines above 601cc - and controls 60 percent of a segment that has almost tripled in size since 2014 and is expected to double again in the next 4-5 years.

With the arrival of Royal Enfield, however, it faces a locally-owned distribution network that dwarfs Harley’s roughly 30 outlets by a multiple of 24.

Were Enfield to ship even 10 of its new big bikes to each of its about 700 locations, it could double Harley’s 3,700 in annual sales.

A day before the new bike’s launch, Royal Enfield on Monday unveiled a 650cc twin engine, putting it on track to compete squarely with the Street 750.

India-based industry analysts and commentators say that Harley’s distribution network in India must be expanded if it is to deal with the new competition and rising demand from the country’s 1 billion plus consumers.

“Having outlet numbers in the mid twenties is clearly a thin distribution spread,” SBICAP Securities analyst Mahantesh Sabarad said.

“India has over 30 10-million-plus cities and each such city needs 2-3 dealerships to cater to a budding market of bike enthusiasts.”

Asked about the new bike last month, Harley Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told Reuters that he would not dismiss a competitor’s strengths but that he had faith in Harley’s brand and would not be changing strategy.

THIN DISTRIBUTION

Popular enthusiasm for commuting bikes in India’s densely populated city streets provides a far larger rider base than in western markets where Harley sells most of its bikes.

Harley plans to increase its network but is cautious about undermining its premium brand and has had problems with complaints about bike servicing in India in the past.

“The specific plans and the rate at which we (expand) is a function of finding a big enough market area and a really competent dealer that can make the investments to have the brand experience that we want to have for riders,” Levatich said.

“So that’s part of the formula, which will naturally make it probably slower and less dense than most of our competitors will do. But that’s our strategy and we are sticking to it.”

Royal Enfield’s new bike - to be unveiled in Milan on Tuesday - is expected to retail at around rupees 300,000 ($4,640) compared to Harley’s Street 750 at more than 500,000 rupees.

Other Harley executives say they feel confident that it will remain a brand Indians will look up to.

“When it comes to wooing those riders from Royal Enfield to Harley Davidson, we have a track record of that now since we have been in India,” said Marc McAllister, Harley’s managing director for international markets.

To thousands of foreign dignitaries, journalists and his own subjects, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to return the kingdom his family has ruled since 1932 to the more moderate society that prevailed before the siege of the Grand Mosque 38 years ago. He may need the global financial community’s help to make it happen.

Saudi has doled out money to global institutions for decades, hoping to generate income for its monarchy. Now the crown prince is turning the tables. At the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, the heir to the throne exhorted global entrepreneurs, business leaders and money managers to put some of their treasure to work in the kingdom. A precondition for that should be that Saudi modernizes, improving the role of women and establishing a more just criminal justice system.

The pitch is sinking in. “The opening up of Saudi Arabia - to try to take things back to before 1979 - is brave, it’s bold,“ Richard Branson said at the so-called ”Davos in the desert“ hosted by the country’s Public Investment Fund last week. The Virgin Group founder is considering backing tourism enterprises along Saudi Arabia’s unspoiled coastline on the Red Sea. ”Young people want it, the women want it and I think most sensible men want it too.”

Nobody seems to want it more than the crown prince, who at 32 is closer in age to more of his subjects than his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Reforming the economy is existential for the House of Saud. If the country cannot provide a hopeful vision for the 33 million people – just under two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30 - the current king could very well be the last. Balancing Islamic traditions and foreign innovations and money – without a bloody revolution – is a demanding transfiguration.

This is why the crown prince’s reference to 1979 was huge – not just because it came during a panel led by a female American journalist. “We will not spend 30 years of our lives dealing with extremist ideologies. We will destroy them today and immediately,” he said to thunderous applause. “Saudi was not like this before 1979. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after 1979. All we are doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world.”

Some history helps to understand the importance of that statement. Just a few weeks short of 38 years ago, armed religious militants stormed and occupied the Grand Mosque of Mecca – the holiest place in the Muslim world – and demanded the overthrow of the royal family. The siege lasted for two weeks and was resolved with the assistance of French commandos who converted to Islam so they could enter the mosque, according to Lawrence Wright’s account in the “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11.”

Following the siege, and public beheadings of 63 rebels, King Khalid bin Abdulaziz doubled down on religion. He expanded the role of conservative religious clerics in Saudi life and allowed Wahhabi leaders to impose sweeping restrictions on cinemas, musical performances and the mingling of genders, among other things. Last week, the crown prince effectively called the last 38 years lost.

The prince must move cautiously enough to accommodate hard-liners, but fast enough to keep his youthful people from rebelling against Saudi’s income inequality. Already the country’s religious police have seen their powers curtailed, and in September the government said it would relax the prohibition on women driving. Though attendees of the conference, arriving in chauffeur-driven Mercedes, applauded talk about making Saudi moderate again it’s not evident they reflect the will of the masses.

That explains NEOM – the city on the Red Sea that the crown prince promised to build from scratch with $500 billion of oil booty. NEOM’s laws and rules will be different from Saudi Arabia’s and determined by the entrepreneurs who populate it, the crown prince says. Though that may not include lifting the prohibition on alcohol, or removing the death penalty for cases of homosexuality or blasphemy, it appears to be a way for him to offer an alternative to the more conservative lifestyle that has governed Saudi since 1979.

NEOM will need global validation - and money. The Vision Fund, in which the kingdom has said it would invest $45 billion alongside SoftBank and others, has already stepped up, pledging to take a stake in the Saudi Electric Co, a utility that will help power NEOM. Though it’s an odd way to channel some of the state’s own money back into the country, bringing along foreign investors could be seen as a validation of the kingdom’s plan.

The crown prince, in an interview, denied that there is any quid pro quo for global investors, like SoftBank, to reinvest funds into Saudi Arabia. “We don’t want to squeeze investors. If we cannot offer good opportunities in Saudi that means no one would come,” he said. “We think we really have great opportunities in Saudi Arabia. We want to shape it and to invest in it ourselves and also to allow people all over the world to invest in it.”

His charms are having an effect. BlackRock and Blackstone Group, with whom the kingdom has invested $20 billion in a fund dedicated to infrastructure, are opening offices in Riyadh, the crown prince told Breakingviews. That should be a sign that their leaders, Larry Fink and Steve Schwarzman, respectively, believe in the crown prince. But there is a flip side to this.

Should the crown prince fail to dismantle the gender apartheid of his predecessors the money managers – and indeed other investors like SoftBank or Branson’s Virgin - could find themselves needing to explain to their own shareholders and customers why they are invested in the kingdom. With the two Wall Street firms alone commanding $6 trillion of assets, that’s a pretty strong incentive for them to help keep the crown prince to his word.",Breakingviews - Cox: Saudi crown prince revealed his magic number,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-breakingviewsbreakin/breakingviews-cox-saudi-crown-prince-revealed-his-magic-number-idUSKBN1D21WW

The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left more than half a million infected with cholera.

“The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,” the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It added that aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen.

The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition’s announcement.

The U.N. and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels battling the Saudi-led coalition.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran’s “hostile actions”. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own “wars of aggression”.

On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of “dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support” after Saudi air defenses intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties.

“WAR CRIMES”

Iran rejected the criticism as “destructive and provocative”.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi “referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country’s action or incitement”, a ministry statement said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday’s missile attack, but the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as “slander”.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank is trying to lure more rich customers by helping them fund their businesses and lifestyles, with shipping, aviation and real estate loans a central focus.

The company has moved lending in those areas from its corporate bank to its wealth management unit, or private bank, over the past two years; the switch is one way in which Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam aims to deliver on his overarching strategy of driving group growth by expanding wealth management.

It is also one reason why Credit Suisse’s private bank is growing faster than that of its Swiss rival UBS (UBSG.S), the world’s largest wealth manager, in terms of revenue and attracting new money.

Moving the financing from its corporate to private bank means that, in those sectors, Credit Suisse will now be primarily lending to affluent individuals - clients whose personal wealth it helps manage.

But there are risks with such exposure. Shipping finance in particular can be a perilous proposition due to doubts over the current profitability of many companies in the industry and whether lenders can make sufficient returns on investments.

Credit Suisse - bucking a trend of banks retreating from shipping - believes it can reduce its vulnerability by lending to the high-net worth individuals who control firms, often millionaire or billionaire tycoons, according to finance experts.

The tactic nevertheless represents a calculated gamble, they said, because these people’s personal wealth are often linked to the fortunes of the industry.

“From the bank’s point of view, the deposits and private wealth product is the juice; the value to the bank has to be strong enough in order to consider making risky loans,” said Basil Karatzas of New York based shipping finance advisory firm Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co.

Credit Suisse declined to give details about its loan exposure in shipping, aviation and property, but finance sources estimated Credit Suisse’s exposure in shipping alone was at least $12 billion. Credit Suisse’s total net private banking loans totaled about 110 billion Swiss francs ($110 billion) at the end of the third quarter.

The bank declined to comment on the shipping loans figure.

Asked about the financing switch to the private bank and the associated risks, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said such lending was part of its overall wealth platform and that the bank considers “franchise value when engaging holistically with wealth management clients”.

A source familiar with the matter said Credit Suisse had not seen any significant losses on shipping loans and that such lending gave it a foot in the door to bank for wealthy families, which run major shipping companies.

SHIPPING MAGNATES

Many banks, facing capital pressure from regulators, are retreating from shipping because of the risks associated with a sector that has struggled with a near decade-long slump caused by too many vessels ordered and weaker demand.

FILE PHOTO: People stand in front of Gulfstream aircraft replicas during the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) at Geneva Airport, Switzerland May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo

Lloyds (LLOY.L) became one of the first lenders to pull out of shipping finance, while fellow British bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) is in the process of exiting. Others such as Germany’s Commerzbank CGKG.DE and Bank of Ireland (BIRG.I) are winding down their remaining exposures. Finance sources estimate the sector has a capital shortfall of $30 billion this year.

Finance experts say Credit Suisse’s new tack of lending via its private bank has helped it make significant in-roads with Greek shipping magnates - among the richest in the industry - in the past year, capitalizing on RBS’s exit from Greece.

Leading Greek shipping tycoon John Angelicoussis is among those that Credit Suisse has helped finance, Thomson Reuters LPC data shows.

“Presently, Credit Suisse seems to be shedding off part of the smaller (ship) owner portfolio and those who are not top tier names with top tier deposits,” said Karatzas. “There is a focus away from the transactional aspect of business towards the relationship-driven business that lowers costs and risks but also builds up on the bank’s traditional core strengths.”

Credit Suisse has taken a similar approach towards aviation and real estate.

Shipping and real estate lending are both bigger businesses than aviation for the bank, the source familiar with the matter said.

RISK APPETITE

Credit Suisse, whose assets under management have hit a record high of 751 billion francs this year, saw a 7 percent rise in net new money in the first nine months of 2017.

By comparison UBS’s flagship wealth management division, with 1.1 trillion francs, reported a 5 percent growth in net new money.

Credit Suisse’s earnings from lending in wealth management have risen 5.8 percent this year, while UBS’s division is down 1 percent.

Any gain that Credit Suisse can make in private banking is valuable as the lender comes off back-to-back multi-billion dollar full-year losses amid a major restructure under Thiam.

It remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of its private bank’s lending tactics will outweigh the risks.

But its arch-rival is not following its approach.

The head of UBS’s wealth management division, Juerg Zeltner, told Reuters in September the bank has no plans to increase risk appetite with regards to lending.

“We’ve defined our risk appetite,” he said. “I know how much earnings I‘m willing to put at risk and that limits my exposure to how much lending I‘m going to do.”",Need help to buy a ship or jet?

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020. That is below an increase to 450,000 by 2021 recommended by the advisory council, to offset an aging population and strains on the social safety net.",Canada to take in migrants at 'gradual' pace amid integration concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D22N3-OCADN

The leaked documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets.

Talks on how goods and services will flow between Britain and the European Union after Brexit in March 2019 have made slow progress, fuelling fears of an exodus of multinational firms.

Speaking to business leaders, May said she understood the importance of clarity for employers and that she hoped for an “implementation period” that would allow the same trading conditions to continue for around two years after Brexit.

But the president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the government’s Brexit strategy reminded him of a soap opera with a different episode each week and that Britain was less united than the EU’s 27 other states.

“Brexit is only 508 days away, but for many businesses their alarm clocks are set earlier than that: They’re set to the moment they’ll actually enact their contingency plans,” CBI President Paul Drechsler said just before May spoke.

“The clock is ticking, so government and the EU need to get a move on... First of all sorting out, with clarity, details on a transitional arrangement.”

A top executive with U.S. automaker Ford also warned of the negative impact a continuing lack of clarity could have.

“If business conditions moving forward mean the UK is not competitive, then we will have to make the decision to adjust and do something else,” said Steven Armstrong, Ford’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa.

“Which is why it’s very important that we get a clear view of what the final agreement (with the EU) is going to be and assurances that we have the transition agreement for a period of time so we can plan and adjust accordingly.”

BT (BT.L), Britain’s biggest telecoms company, said unless businesses were clear by early 2018 about the terms of a transition they would need to plan for a damaging “hard Brexit”.

CLIFF-EDGE

Ever since the June 2016 EU referendum, business leaders have been calling on the government to give them clarity about how Brexit will look, though ministers say that is impossible, given that the exit terms have still to be negotiated.

“I know how important it is for business and industry not to face a cliff-edge and to have the time it needs to plan and prepare for the new arrangements,” May told the CBI conference.

“I want us to agree the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible.”

But May, who recently unnerved executives by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement is sealed, had little detail on timing.

“We are in a negotiation with the European Union ... First of all we need to get full agreement that this is something that will happen, and then we’ll need to negotiate the details,” she said in response to a question from Reuters.

“Of course, some of those details, you need to know what the end state is, what that future partnership is, because this is about practical change.”

May’s Brexit minister has said previously he wants an outline transitional deal in early 2018.

Almost two in three British firms will have implemented contingency plans by March if Britain and the EU have not struck a transitional deal by then, a CBI survey said. Another survey said most European businesses plan to cut back orders from British suppliers because of the slow progress of Brexit talks.

While Britain’s economy has shown unexpected resilience since the Brexit vote, there are signs of weakness including slowing growth and accelerating inflation.

Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as an undemocratic and costly experiment in European integration they say is doomed to fail.

The initial public offering by Reliance Nippon, which counts Reliance Capital Ltd (RLCP.NS) and Nippon Life Insurance Co as its main shareholders, raised 15.42 billion rupees ($238.29 million) and was subscribed over 81 times.

The listing comes at a time when money managers have seen their assets under management surge to a record of over 21 trillion rupees, as retail investors buy shares, many for the first time, sending indexes to all-time highs.

The funds are expected to be sturdy given many investors are buying into mutual funds through monthly instalment schemes called systematic investment plans (SIP).

“Overall the listing is at a decent price. At this moment mutual funds are getting huge funds in the form of SIPs, new funds, etc.” said Jaikishan Parmar, an equity analyst at Angel Broking.

“Going forward shareholders will be rewarded well. This is a kind of company you should hold for 5 to 10 years. As yields go up, valuations also rise.”

Shares in the company were trading at 291.30 rupees, up 15.60 percent by 0809 GMT in the NSE Nifty that was up 0.3 percent.

The strong retail flows have helped the Nifty gain nearly 28 percent this year, touching a record high on Friday, while IPO sales have hit a record with more than $9 billion raised so far this year.

Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd is the third largest asset manager in India, with 3.6 trillion rupees ($55.65 billion) in assets under management as of end-June, giving it a 11.4 percent market share.

Reliance Nippon was profitable and has a strong nationwide presence in India, analysts said. It has also set up subsidiaries in Singapore and Mauritius and a representative office in Dubai.

Singers Jason Aldean, Jake Owen and Chris Young were among the musicians either on stage in Las Vegas when the shooting broke out, or watching the show.

Caleb Keete, a guitarist with the Josh Abbott Band, said in October that the shooting had caused him to change his stance on gun control after being a lifelong supporter of the right to bear arms.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from “dangerous” heart disease and kidney problems.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom.

Already rattled by the slow progress of Brexit talks, businesses operating in the world's fifth largest economy have been pressing for months for details about what any transitional EU trade deal will actually look like.",UK PM May seeks to reassure Britain's business leaders,https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/06/uk-pm-may-seeks-to-reassure-britains-bus?videoId=372911909&videoChannel=101

WhatsApp, which is widely used in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, said message encryption prevented it from monitoring the third-party providers Indonesians use to search for GIFs.

It asked the government to work with the providers instead.

Semuel Pangerapan, a director general at Indonesia’s communications and informatics ministry, said WhatsApp would be blocked within 48 hours unless the images supplied by third parties were taken off the service.

“Yes, true. They have to follow the rules of the host,” Pangerapan said of the proposed block.

The ministry had sent three letters to WhatsApp over the issue, he said.

“They have responded, but asked us to speak directly to the third party. The GIFs appeared in their apps. Why do we have to be the one speaking to the third party? They are supposed to be the ones managing it,” said Pangerapan.

Tenor, a third-party provider of GIFs to WhatsApp, had been blocked, Pangerapan said.

Tenor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“In Indonesia, WhatsApp lets people search for GIFs using third-party providers,” a Whatsapp representative said in a statement.

“We are not able to monitor GIFs on WhatsApp since content is end-to-end encrypted. We’ve directed the Indonesia government to work with these third-party providers to review their content.”

Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users as of the first quarter of 2014, ranking the country fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, company data showed.

Some reaction on Indonesian social media to the threatened block was skeptical. ”While you’re at it, why don’t you block Twitter too, (and) if necessary all browsers in the Playstore, because it’s way easier to search for porn there than on WhatsApp,” wrote one Twitter user, with the handle @jnessy.

Another, using the handle @yogirswnt, said “Does the government want to block WhatsApp? In the case of Telegram it was only a bluff, but if true, it is so unfortunate.”

Indonesia briefly blocked access this year to some channels of the Telegram messaging app, saying its forums were “full of radicals and terrorist propaganda”, before reaching a pact with the messaging service on how to rein in propaganda.

The Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI) had urged the communications ministry to block pornographic GIF images accessible via emoticons, complaining that children could easily reach them, according to news website kompas.com.",Indonesia threatens to block WhatsApp messaging over obscene content,https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-whatsapp-indonesia/indonesia-threatens-to-block-whatsapp-messaging-over-obscene-content-idINKBN1D615S

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

The subject’s inclusion on the monthly meeting’s agenda of EU finance ministers came after weekend media reports citing the so-called “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents leaked mostly from Appleby, a prominent offshore law firm.

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified them. Appleby was not immediately available for comment.

The latest revelations “put renewed emphasis on the work the European Commission is doing to fight tax avoidance”, the vice president of the EU’s executive arm, Valdis Dombrovskis, told reporters on Monday.

EU countries had planned for months to reach an agreement on a blacklist for tax havens by the end of this year. The new revelations prompted the discussion to be brought forward, EU officials said, but no final decision was expected on Tuesday.

The EU has discussed several measures to crack down on tax avoidance, including in the wake of the “Panama Papers”, a release by the ICIJ last year which chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Measures proposed by the European Commission include an EU-wide list of tax havens meant to discourage the rerouting of profits made in the EU to tax-free or low-tax countries, like Panama or Bermuda.

At the moment, each EU state has its own list of jurisdictions that are seen as less cooperative on tax matters. Criteria to define a tax haven vary greatly among EU states and some of them omit any jurisdictions in their national blacklists.

ONE-COUNTRY LIST?

An EU-wide blacklist is believed to carry more weight. Jurisdictions included in the list could be subject to sanctions if they did not cooperate.

“It’s time that we agree and publish a blacklist on tax havens,” EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters, calling for a “credible” list and “adequate sanctions” when serious breaches are unveiled.

There are no details yet of the type of sanctions that could be imposed, although being on the blacklist in itself could discourage individuals and companies from putting money in those jurisdictions.

Moscovici added that the EU blacklist should be more ambitious than the existing list of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations that has so far been leading the fight against tax avoidance.

The OECD list of non-cooperative jurisdictions on tax transparency includes to date only Trinidad and Tobago.

Some EU countries remain skeptical about the blacklist and are themselves under scrutiny for unfair tax competition.

Smaller EU states, like Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, attract firms with lower corporate taxes. Some have been sanctioned for deals with multinationals that slashed their tax bills, reducing revenues in other EU states.

To win over their resistance, the proposed EU blacklist would apply only to non-EU countries. Also, states which charge no corporate taxes will not be automatically considered tax havens, under a preliminary deal reached by EU finance ministers last year.

On tax matters the EU can take decisions only with the unanimous backing of its 28 member states, unless extraordinary procedures are launched - an option never tested so far.

To reduce the appeal of tax havens, Brussels has also proposed the setting up of public registries that would show the real owners of companies, which are often hidden by frontmen in shell firms in offshore jurisdictions.

It has also proposed compulsory reporting by large multinational firms of profits made and taxes paid in each state where they operate, in a bid to show how much of their revenues are booked in low-tax countries.

EU states have long been discussing both proposals, but no deal has been reached yet. “EU governments such as Germany have been standing against the rising tide of financial transparency,” said Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International EU.",EU to discuss tax havens blacklist after 'Paradise Papers' leaks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ecofin-taxavoidance/eu-to-discuss-tax-havens-blacklist-after-paradise-papers-leaks-idUKKBN1D618S

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis. (After publication of this column, a spokesman for Hakim's movement told Reuters that while Hakim and Faisal had both attended an iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, Faisal ""was one of the invitees among other many people, and there was no meeting or political talk during that event."")

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Ross was responding in media interviews to reports on Sunday about his investments stemming from the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investment that relate to the affairs of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“There is nothing wrong with anything that was done,” Ross told CNBC, adding that he had not considered resigning following Sunday’s report. Ross is a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which the New York Times said earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for Russian petrochemical firm Sibur.

The Times, which based its report on files from prominent offshore law firm Appleby, said Sibur stakeholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and Putin associate who is subject to U.S. sanctions, and Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.

Navigator was mentioned in Ross’s 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. The Times said the latest batch of documents provided more insight into his financial holdings.

Reuters was not able to confirm the Times’ findings.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest such holdings.

The investments raised questions about whose interests Ross represents, Blumenthal said, calling for an inspector general probe by the department as well as congressional hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC in an interview.

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

SANCTIONS

In an earlier statement, a Department of Commerce spokesman said Ross “was not involved in Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur ... has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship”.

He added that Sibur had not been under sanctions when Navigator began its relationship with the publicly-traded firm and still was not.

“A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period. It was a normal commercial relationship and one that I had nothing to do with the creation of, and do not know the shareholders who were apparently sanctioned at some later point in time,” Ross told CNBC.

In a statement, Sibur said it had no direct dealings with Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.

Neither Navigator nor Appleby were available for comment on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Timchenko declined to comment, while Shamalov did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

In its report, the Times said Ross had kept the investment in Navigator, which increased its business dealings with Sibur, including chartering ships, even as Western nations sought to punish Russia’s energy sector over Putin’s incursions into Ukraine.

“The Secretary recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,” the Commerce Department spokesman said, adding that Ross maintains the “highest ethical standards.”

Separately, the Times cited Appleby’s files in another report that said hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin were behind Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner’s investments in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

QUEEN‘S TAXES

Citing the Appleby documents, Britain’s Guardian newspaper said millions of pounds from Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, had been invested in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio never before disclosed.

Reuters could not independently confirm the Guardian report.

The newspaper said the Duchy had used offshore private equity funds designed to shield investors in the United Kingdom from having to pay U.S. tax on their holdings.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.”

The spokeswoman also said the Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income received from the Duchy.

Citing the documents, Guardian also reported that international trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) had “secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars” to Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a mining deal in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The British newspaper said Gertler had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters was not immediately able to contact him.

Glencore said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, but dated Oct. 27 and addressed to the ICIJ, that it had made a loan to a company affiliated to Gertler in 2009 on commercial terms and that it was fully repaid.

“In February 2009, Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd made a loan to Lora Enterprises Limited (Lora), an entity affiliated with Mr Gertler,” the company said.

“The loan to Lora was made on commercial terms negotiated at arm’s length,” it said. “The loan was fully repaid by Lora in 2010.”",U.S. commerce chief Ross: Nothing improper about his Russia-tied investments,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-paradise-tax-usa/u-s-commerce-chief-ross-nothing-improper-about-his-russia-tied-investments-idUKKBN1D6003?il=0

Two British companies pulled their planned London listings on Friday, following weak performances from other new stocks. At the same time, tycoon-controlled Russian energy group En+ priced its shares at the bottom of the offer range. The one thing still rising is the number of banks working on IPOs. That’s part of the problem.

The London Stock Exchange

Arqiva, a broadcast infrastructure group, and Bakkavor, which makes hummus for supermarkets, both shelved their IPOs at the last minute, saying that the market for new issues is too volatile. There’s something to that, at least in Britain. Companies in Europe have raised $38.5 billion in new equity offerings in 2017, 22 percent more than at this time last year. In Britain, however, total takings are down 13 percent.

True, the affected companies have their quirks. Arqiva runs old-school TV masts, while Bakkavor has four customers of scale and En+ is an oligarch’s plaything. Yet newly listed stocks elsewhere are also doing less well than new investors might have hoped. Shares in BAWAG Group, an Austrian bank, have fallen 5 percent since they started trading on Oct. 25. SMCP, a French clothier, is also trading below its offer price. HelloFresh, which delivers pre-prepared recipe kits and is ploughing the proceeds of its offering into marketing, is barely a whisker above where it started on Thursday.

Hedge funds are one source of trouble. Having made a decent return this year so far – 10.7 percent on equity strategies by Sept. 30 according to Preqin data – fund managers have little incentive to risk their performance fees on untested new stocks. Shares in Blue Apron, an American HelloFresh clone, have plunged by two-thirds since the company’s June IPO in New York. Hedge funds aren’t everything, but they provide capital markets bankers with a useful way of jimmying up price tension.

The finger then points to the banks themselves. After all, their job ought to be to know how market participants are feeling some time before the 11th hour. But accountability is being spread ever thinner. A European IPO now has on average 2.5 bookrunners – the highest ever in the region.

The latest row over Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern Himalayas that China claims as southern Tibet suggests the neighbors remain far apart, despite recent attempts to defuse tension.

On Sunday, Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took stock of defense preparedness in Arunachal Pradesh along the Line of Actual Control, the de facto, but disputed, border between the two countries.

Sitharaman also tweeted pictures of her visit, including her meeting with Indian army officers.

China lashed back on Monday.

“An Indian official going to a disputed region on the China- India border will perhaps make the issue even more complex, and is not beneficial to efforts by both parties to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, New Delhi has reacted strongly to any attempts challenging its sovereignty over Arunachal.

China and India have tried to develop two-ways ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute.

In April, China slammed India’s decision to host Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the region, saying it could cause serious damage to relations.

China hoped India could meet it half-way to resolve their differences, Hua said.

“We hope India can work with China to continue to use talks to appropriately resolve the border issue via negotiation and create good conditions and atmosphere,” she added.",China slams Indian minister's visit to disputed border region,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-india/china-slams-indian-defence-ministers-visit-to-arunachal-pradesh-idINKBN1D61AJ

The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected.

Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter.

The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

“I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,” Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. “We are on it, we’ve got it covered,” but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said.

The Palo Alto, California-based company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called “production bottlenecks.” It had planned to build more than 1,500.

Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company’s cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car.

Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally.

Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 17 percent from a 12-month high of $385 in September, but are still up 50 percent from January fueled by belief in the long-term prospects of the company.

Tesla’s soaring stock has made the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker behind General Motors Co (GM.N), which had annual net profit of $9.4 billion in 2016.

LARGEST-EVER LOSS

Tesla could face major new requirements for cash given Model 3 problems, a possible factory in China, and plans to develop other vehicles, including an electric heavy duty truck.

But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market.

Tesla said it was “well capitalized” for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla’s August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year.

Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter.

The price of the $1.8 billion eight-year junk bond 88160RAE1= issued by Tesla last August also fell after the quarterly report.

Tesla’s continued need for cash is exacerbated by Musk’s insistence on vertical integration, such as making its own batteries and selling cars directly to customers. That, industry experts say, is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its aggressive goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

Tesla warned that its adjusted gross margin would decline to about 15 percent due to a higher mix of lower-margin Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter, but then recover in the first quarter of 2018.

Last month, Tesla reported it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016.","Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-stock-falls-on-model-3-delays-biggest-ever-quarterly-loss-idUSKBN1D15TP

FirstRand has been looking to return to developed markets following a rethink of its strategy prompted by slowing growth and rising risks elsewhere in Africa.
Aldermore was founded in 2009 by a former Barclays executive with backing from private equity firm AnaCap.
“It (Aldermore) will allow the FirstRand to allocate more financial resources to our operations in Africa, whilst diversifying earnings in the UK,” FirstRand CEO Johan Burger said.
Credit Suisse and Rand Merchant Bank are acting as financial advisers to FirstRand.","LONDON (Reuters) - South African lender FirstRand (FSRJ.J) has agreed a 1.1 billion pound ($1.3 billion) takeover of British banking newcomer Aldermore Group (ALD.L) to boost its business in developed markets.

The 313 pence per share offer represents a 22.3 percent premium to Aldermore’s closing price of 245 pence on Oct. 12, the day before the companies announced they were in talks.

At 0820 GMT, Aldermore’s shares were up 2.4 percent at 309.7 pence. FirstRand’s shares were up 0.2 percent at 52.49 rand.

Aldermore is one of a group of so-called challenger banks that emerged after the financial crisis to fill a gap in small business lending and capitalize on problems at bigger lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds (LLOY.L).

However, they have been seen as ripe for takeovers recently after a prolonged period of low interest rates and sluggish British economic growth squeezed earnings, while the pound’s fall has made them cheaper for foreign buyers.

FirstRand has been looking to return to developed markets following a rethink of its strategy prompted by slowing growth and rising risks elsewhere in Africa. It already runs MotoNovo, a vehicle financing business, in Britain.

African markets have been depressed by a slump in oil and other commodity prices - export mainstays of many economies - leading companies to scale back operations.

Aldermore was founded in 2009 by a former Barclays executive with backing from private equity firm AnaCap. AnaCap said in an email statement that it welcomes the news of the takeover.

Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, who rate Aldermore as “hold”, called the offer reasonable.

BROADENING THE BASE

FirstRand said on Monday that further growth could be unlocked in Britain through cross-selling the current product range across MotoNovo and Aldermore’s customer bases.

“It (Aldermore) will allow the FirstRand to allocate more financial resources to our operations in Africa, whilst diversifying earnings in the UK,” FirstRand CEO Johan Burger said.

Aldermore has been one of the better performing UK challenger banks. It released its third-quarter earnings on Monday, reporting higher nine-month new lending at 2.4 billion pounds thanks to strong demand from small and medium sized businesses, homeowners and landlords. [nRSF5920Va]

Once the deal -- which will be put to a vote by Aldermore’s shareholders -- completes, FirstRand’s UK retail and SME operations will be joined with Aldermore, the African lender said. Aldermore’s CEO Phillip Monks will head the new combined UK business.

“We’ve developed into a multiproduct diversified lender, and having spoken to FirstRand we can expand and accelerate that strategy in the UK,” Monks told Reuters.

“I am personally attracted to continuing in my role,” he said.

The Croatian replaced Sam Allardyce in June, 2015 and led West Ham to a seventh-placed finish in his first season. He also oversaw their move to the London Stadium but has won just two out of 11 league games in this campaign.

“West Ham United can confirm that Slaven Bilic has today left his position with the club,” West Ham said in a statement.

Former Everton, Manchester United and Sunderland manager David Moyes, who is currently out of work, has been strongly linked with the position.

West Ham said they “believe a change is now necessary in order for the club to move forward positively and in line with their ambition”.

“The club’s search for a new manager to take West Ham United forward is underway and an announcement regarding Bilic’s successor is expected to be made over the coming days,” the statement added.

Moyes told BeInSport on Sunday that he was willing to take on the challenge of keeping the Hammers in the Premier League.

“I’ve always said I want to go back into club management. If the right opportunity comes around, I’ll be interested.”

Asked about West Ham before Bilic’s sacking, the 54-year-old, who also had a brief and unsuccessful spell with Real Sociedad in Spain, said: “I am interested but at the moment that vacancy has not become available. I know what Slaven must be going through.”

Bilic, who played as a defender for West Ham, has been under pressure throughout this campaign and although a League Cup win over Tottenham bought him time, a draw at bottom club Crystal Palace and the heavy home loss to Liverpool sealed his fate.

West Ham’s joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold praised Bilic for his commitment and integrity.

“The board invested heavily signing the players Slaven believed would complete the squad he needed to push the club back towards the level we had reached in his first season, and we believe we have the players capable of doing that,” they said.

”Sadly, performances and results have not been of the expected standard and, in recent weeks, we have not seen enough indication of the required improvement to give us the encouragement that things would change and we would meet our Premier League aspirations this season.

“We see this as an exciting opportunity to appoint a quality manager to the position to inject fresh ideas, organisation and enthusiasm into a very talented squad,” Gold and Sullivan added.

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D61EO-OCATC

At least Thomas Morel is hoping they will. He’s a 30-year-old former financier who saw how much Canadians liked the sport, or game, or pastime, or whatever axe-throwing might be.

“And I told myself, this is bound to work in Paris,” Morel said.

So he opened Les Cognees - French for “axes” or “hatchets” - where people can gather after work and pay to hurl heavy edged weapons around. What could go wrong?

Quite a lot, obviously, but safeguards are in place: no alcohol is served, the blades of the axes are blunted and security measures are read out to participants when they arrive.

And they are arriving. Morel’s venue is in the city’s north-east 18th district, a traditionally working-class neighborhood showing tentative signs of gentrification. On a typical day this week, it had attracted about 30 men and women in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

Some had come with friends and some, improbably, were there on corporate outings. For example, 29-year-old Antoine Verdier, a legal manager, and his boss, Camille Cocaud, had come on a team-building exercise.

“It’s a great way to unwind after work,” Cocaud said.

“It’s a real melting pot,” Morel said. “You get the young hipsters, you get companies on team-building, but you also get punks, you get mothers with children, you get families.”

Morel’s timing is good. France is trying to get more people to take part in sports, partly to promote the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

In fact, Morel can see a great marketing opportunity approaching, although some might say it’s a tad over-ambitious:

Repairing the damage wrought on the broadband system, including replacing steel-braid wires that the pesky parrots have gnawed, has already cost A$80,000 ($61,500), network builder NBN Co said on Friday.

The company estimates the bill could rise sharply as more damage is uncovered and more cables are rolled out in the national telecommunications infrastructure project, which is not due to be completed until around 2021.

“They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across,” said NBN Co project manager Chedryian Bresland in a blog post on the company’s website on Friday.

“Unfortunately, they’ve developed a liking to our cables ... these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm.”

Yellow-crested cockatoos are prolific in Australia and well-known for their voracious appetites for everything from fruit crops to wooden window frames.

Much of the cable chomping has occurred in grain-growing regions in Australia’s southeast.

“It would have to be an acquired taste, because it’s not their usual style,” Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behavior at the University of New England, told Reuters.

“Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, They don’t usually go for cables. But it might be the color or the position of the cables that’s attracted them,” she said.

The subject’s inclusion on the monthly meeting’s agenda came after the weekend publication of media reports citing the so-called “Paradise Papers”, a trove of leaked financial documents mostly from Appleby, a prominent offshore law firm.

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified them. Appleby was not immediately available for comment.

EU countries had planned for months to reach an agreement on a blacklist for tax havens by the end of this year. The new revelations prompted the discussion to be brought forward, EU officials said, but no final decision was expected on Tuesday.

The EU has discussed several measures to crack down on tax avoidance in the past, including in the wake of the “Panama Papers”, a release by the ICIJ last year which chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Measures previously discussed include an EU-wide list of tax havens meant to discourage the rerouting of profits made in the EU to tax-free or low-tax countries, like Panama or Bermuda.

At the moment, each EU country has its own list of jurisdictions that are seen as less cooperative on tax matters. Criteria to define a tax haven vary greatly among EU states and some of them include no jurisdictions in their national blacklists.

An EU blacklist is believed to carry more weight. Jurisdictions included in the list could be subject to sanctions if they did not cooperate.

There are no details yet of the type of sanctions to be discussed, although being on the blacklist in itself could discourage individuals and companies from putting money in those jurisdictions.

Some EU countries remain sceptical about the blacklist and are themselves under scrutiny for unfair tax competition.

Smaller EU states, like Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland, attract firms with lower corporate taxes. Some have been sanctioned for deals with multinationals that slashed their tax bills, reducing revenues in other EU states.

To win over their resistance, the proposed EU blacklist would apply only to non-EU countries. Also, states which charge no corporate taxes will not be automatically considered tax havens, under a preliminary deal reached by EU finance ministers last year.

On tax matters the EU can take decisions only with the unanimous backing of its 28 member states, unless extraordinary procedures are launched - an option never tested so far.

To reduce the appeal of tax havens, Brussels has also proposed the setting up of public registries that would show the real owners of companies, which are often hidden by frontmen in shell firms in offshore jurisdictions.

It has also proposed compulsory reporting by large multinational firms of profits made and taxes paid in each state where they operate, in a bid to show how much of their revenues are booked in low-tax countries.

EU states have been long discussing both proposals, but no deal has been reached yet. “EU governments such as Germany have been standing against the rising tide of financial transparency,” said Carl Dolan, director of Transparency International EU.",EU to discuss blacklist of tax havens after 'Paradise Papers' leaks,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-ecofin-taxavoidance/eu-to-discuss-blacklist-of-tax-havens-after-paradise-papers-leaks-idUKKBN1D6192

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-tech-toyota/toyota-seeks-more-investments-in-israeli-auto-tech-robotics-idUSKBN1D50OI

Selection of jurors is scheduled to begin before U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn. On trial Manuel Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation; José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s soccer federation; and Juan Ángel Napout, formerly president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and of Paraguay’s soccer federation.

U.S. prosecutors have accused the three of taking bribes and kickbacks in connection with the sale of media and marketing rights to Copa America and Copa Libertadores tournaments, international competitions organized by CONMEBOL.

The trial is part of a sweeping criminal probe in which U.S. prosecutors have charged 42 people and entities. Prosecutors have described a widespread culture of corruption around the awarding of media and marketing rights to soccer games throughout the world. Burga, Marin and Napout are the first of the people charged to go to trial.

Twenty-four people have pleaded guilty, most of them since the probe was announced in May 2015, though the first pleas came in 2013. The charges against one of those people, U.S. soccer official Charles Blazer, were voided after his death in July.

“After waiting two years, Mr. Napout looks forward to his day in court,” Napout’s lawyer, Silvia Pinera-Vazquez, said on Friday.

Charles Stillman, a lawyer for Marin, and Bruce Udolf, a lawyer for Burga, declined to comment.

Among the defendants who have pleaded guilty in the case are Jeffrey Webb, a former FIFA vice president and president of CONCACAF, the governing body for soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean; and José Hawilla, accused of paying bribes to secure contracts for his sports marketing company, Traffic Group.

In October, Costas Takkas, described by prosecutors as Webb’s attache, was sentenced to 15 months in prison and Hector Trujillo, a former secretary general of the Guatemalan soccer federation, was sentenced to eight months.

Other defendants have not been extradited to the United States.

Sepp Blatter, who served as FIFA’s president from 1998 until he was suspended in late 2015, was not charged in the case.

Harun Mwau filed the petition hours before a Monday deadline set by the constitution expired. Earlier in the day, a coalition of civil society groups said they were being targeted by the government in an effort to head off potential legal cases.

The Supreme Court has until Nov. 14 to rule on election petitions. If it upholds the result, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28.

Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term in August, defeating opposition leader Raila Odinga by 1.4 million votes. The Supreme Court nullified the vote citing procedural irregularities and ordered a second election.

Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26 saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote, though opposition supporters staged a boycott and prevented polls from opening in the west of the country.

Kenya is a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security and its prolonged election season has disrupted its economy.

Rights groups said on Monday the government was trying to prevent them from lodging cases challenging the Oct. 26 result. The government’s NGO Board, which monitors civil society organizations, summoned three groups for an audit on Monday, they said.

“It is not a coincidence that the NGO Board has decided to come after these organizations. All three have been instrumental in calling for free, fair, and credible elections,” said a statement from Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society groups that monitored the election.

The name means My Vote My Voice in Kiswahili.

The three organizations, Katiba Institute, Muslims for Human Rights and Inuka Trust, belong to the coalition. The head of Muslims for Human Rights said he had planned to file a court challenge.

Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu deployed 2,000 monitors for last month’s vote and said it found multiple cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal.

“They are trying to attack everywhere to see who is preparing to go to court so that they stop it,” Tom Oketch, secretary general for the Coalition for Constitutional Implementation, told a news conference.

Calls to Fazul Mohamed, the NGO Board’s executive director, went unanswered. Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the interior ministry, under which the board falls, said only Mohamed could comment.

In a separate case, another organization filed a case against the opposition, seeking to hold them liable for losses incurred because of their demonstrations.",Petition filed in Kenya court challenging Kenyatta's election victory,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D61ZB-OZATP

FILE PHOTO: Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal.

The company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators would reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would create a dominant company in the market for supplying chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares in a deal. Including debt, Broadcom’s bid values the transaction at $130 billion.

GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives said bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” he said.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014.

On Monday, Qualcomm’s shares were up 3 percent at $63.71 in morning trading, suggesting that investors were skeptical a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares were flat after hitting a record high of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny. A big hurdle would be getting regulatory approval in China, on which both Qualcomm and Broadcom rely on heavily to make money.

China is set to scrutinize any deal closely after U.S. regulators blocked a flurry of chip deals by Chinese firms due to security concerns, thwarting the Asian country’s attempt to become self-reliant in chip manufacturing.

Broadcom could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said.

FILE PHOTO: One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion as of Sept. 24.

“We think QTL could fetch $25 billion in a sale to a private equity firm or multi-national telecommunications company,” Shah said.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are highly confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary debt financing for the proposed transaction.

The company has also got commitment letter for $5 billion debt financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Broadcom approached Qualcomm last year to discuss a potential combination, but did not contact Qualcomm prior to unveiling its $70 per share offer on Monday, according to sources.

Qualcomm is more vulnerable to a takeover now because its shares have been held down by a patent dispute with Apple, as well as concerns it may have to raise its own $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom said its proposal stands irrespective of whether Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP goes through or not.

Qualcomm has a shareholder-friendly corporate governance structure, making it more vulnerable to a takeover bid.

Its entire 10-member board is up for re-election this spring, and Broadcom could seize on the December nomination deadline to put forward its own slate that would then help make negotiations.

The bid for Qualcomm is an ambitious move by Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States. It has pulled off a string of purchases over a decade.

Tan will be in New York and Boston this week for meetings with Qualcomm shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

Broadcom’s offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company’s shares.","Broadcom offers $103 billion for Qualcomm, sets up takeover battle",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D61EO-OCABS

Now an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists into 13.4 million financial statements, emails, loan agreements and other paperwork has uncovered politicians, financiers and companies using secrecy to hide transactions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had an investment in a shipping firm with significant ties to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ICIJ says. Even Queen Elizabeth invested through offshore companies.

There can be legitimate reasons for wanting to hide business interests offshore, especially for those living in turbulent countries. But getting away from tax and law-enforcement authorities is getting more complicated, and therefore dearer.

More than 100 jurisdictions – including several offshore financial centres – have committed to automatically exchange tax information with foreign governments. About 50 started sharing data in September, making it harder for individuals and companies to hide their financial dealings. Meanwhile, countries including Britain and Sweden have passed legislation that forces foreign companies and legal entities operating within their borders to disclose their ultimate owner – bypassing the often complex chain of offshore vehicles and trusts. Others, including the United States, are also introducing or tightening beneficial ownership rules.

Regulation will not stop the global flow of illicit money. Loopholes can always be found, and there are enough dark spots on the planet. But technology which makes it easier to download, distribute and organise massive volumes of data also facilitates leaks. For legitimate investors and corporations, secrecy may end up becoming too much of a costly liability.",Breakingviews - Offshore secrecy succumbs to diminishing returns,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paradise-tax-breakingviews/breakingviews-offshore-secrecy-succumbs-to-diminishing-returns-idUSKBN1D61IW

Having already bought 2.2 trillion euros worth of bonds to depress borrowing costs, the ECB has started to shift its focus from new purchases, arguing that its bloated balance sheet will provide the bulk of accommodation needed to lift inflation.

New buys will be cut in half to 30 billion euros a month from January and markets expect the ECB to end purchases by the end of the year. One reason is that finding enough bonds is becoming increasingly difficult within the legal parameters of the program, commonly known as quantitative easing.

October data released on Monday showed that purchases remained skewed towards countries such as France and Italy, with the ECB deviating from the so-called capital key, a rule that requires purchases in line with the size of each country’s economy.

Bond buys in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, were about 300 million euros below the capital key. They also trailed in Portugal and dropped to zero in Ireland, where the ECB already has sizable bond holdings.

The ECB’s problem is that it cannot hold more than a third of each country’s debt, so once it reaches a the limit, it needs to redistribute purchases among countries with bigger bond markets, facing accusations that it is de facto rewarding more indebted countries.

SMALLER THAN EXPECTED

Redemptions, disclosed for the first time on Monday, will average 10.8 billion euros a month in the 12 months from November, below analyst expectations for around 15 billion euros, with big fluctuations expected between months, the data released for the first time showed.

Redemptions will peak in April, when they hit 24.3 billion euros. The lowest monthly total will be in August, when they drop to 2 billion euros, the figures showed.

The vast majority of redemptions -- 101.5 billion euros -- will be in the public-sector purchase program, which is dominated by government bonds. Eighteen billion euros worth of covered bonds and seven billion euros of asset-backed securities are also due to mature.

Cash maturing from government bonds will be reinvested within two months in the same country as the original bond, if market conditions allow, the ECB said earlier. The re-investments are due to continue for an extended period after new buys end.

ECB data also showed that redemptions have been relatively minor this autumn with the public-sector maturities totaling 22.7 billion euros until the end of October.

“It will not deliver the tens of billions in synergies we had foreseen in a merger with T-Mobile,” Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said of the Altice agreement on a call with analysts and reporters. “Nonetheless, it does deliver real value for Sprint.”

Sprint’s shares were down 12 percent at $5.84 after earlier falling as much as 13.5 percent,

Altice said it would sell mobile service on Sprint’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest cable company to enter the wireless market.

A day earlier, Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks, raising questions over how Sprint, in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut costs and shore up cash, could increase investment in its network.

The Altice partnership was not contingent on merger talks with T-Mobile failing, Robbiati said.

He also said comments by Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son on raising capital expenditure to $5 billion to $6 billion annually, from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, was for the medium term and not for 2017.

Asked how Sprint would pay for the increase in spending, Robbiati said the company could fund it through cash, debt and borrowing against its spectrum, or wireless airwaves.

Last year, Sprint said it would raise an initial $3.5 billion by mortgaging about 14 percent of its spectrum.

Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said $5 billion to $6 billion annually was the minimum level at which Sprint could build a credible network, but the company faced challenges in catching up with wireless carriers that are moving ahead with developing next generation networks, or 5G.

“Sprint is trying to catch up to a moving target,” he said. “I think the market is going to be reasonably skeptical.”",Sprint shares plunge after T-Mobile merger talks called off,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-altice-usa/sprint-shares-plunge-after-t-mobile-merger-talks-called-off-idUSKBN1D620V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Ross was responding in media interviews to reports on Sunday about his investments stemming from the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investment that relate to the affairs of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

The documents were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets. Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“There is nothing wrong with anything that was done,” Ross told CNBC, adding that he had not considered resigning following Sunday’s report. Ross is a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which the New York Times said earns millions of dollars a year transporting gas for Russian petrochemical firm Sibur.

The Times, which based its report on files from prominent offshore law firm Appleby, said Sibur stakeholders include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian oligarch and Putin associate who is subject to U.S. sanctions, and Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.

Navigator was mentioned in Ross’s 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. The Times said the latest batch of documents provided more insight into his financial holdings.

Reuters was not able to confirm the Times’ findings.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest such holdings.

The investments raised questions about whose interests Ross represents, Blumenthal said, calling for an inspector general probe by the department as well as congressional hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC in an interview.

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

SANCTIONS

In an earlier statement, a Department of Commerce spokesman said Ross “was not involved in Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur ... has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship”.

He added that Sibur had not been under sanctions when Navigator began its relationship with the publicly-traded firm and still was not.

“A company not under sanction is just like any other company, period. It was a normal commercial relationship and one that I had nothing to do with the creation of, and do not know the shareholders who were apparently sanctioned at some later point in time,” Ross told CNBC.

In a statement, Sibur said it had no direct dealings with Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.

Neither Navigator nor Appleby were available for comment on Sunday evening. A spokesman for Timchenko declined to comment, while Shamalov did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

In its report, the Times said Ross had kept the investment in Navigator, which increased its business dealings with Sibur, including chartering ships, even as Western nations sought to punish Russia’s energy sector over Putin’s incursions into Ukraine.

“The Secretary recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,” the Commerce Department spokesman said, adding that Ross maintains the “highest ethical standards.”

Separately, the Times cited Appleby’s files in another report that said hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin were behind Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner’s investments in Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).

QUEEN‘S TAXES

Citing the Appleby documents, Britain’s Guardian newspaper said millions of pounds from Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, had been invested in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio never before disclosed.

Reuters could not independently confirm the Guardian report.

The newspaper said the Duchy had used offshore private equity funds designed to shield investors in the United Kingdom from having to pay U.S. tax on their holdings.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster said: “We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.”

The spokeswoman also said the Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income received from the Duchy.

Citing the documents, Guardian also reported that international trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L) had “secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars” to Israeli businessman Dan Gertler, after enlisting him to secure a mining deal in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The British newspaper said Gertler had denied any wrongdoing. Reuters was not immediately able to contact him.

Glencore said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday, but dated Oct. 27 and addressed to the ICIJ, that it had made a loan to a company affiliated to Gertler in 2009 on commercial terms and that it was fully repaid.

“In February 2009, Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd made a loan to Lora Enterprises Limited (Lora), an entity affiliated with Mr Gertler,” the company said.

“The loan to Lora was made on commercial terms negotiated at arm’s length,” it said. “The loan was fully repaid by Lora in 2010.”",U.S. commerce chief Ross: Nothing improper about his Russia-tied investments,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paradise-tax-usa/u-s-commerce-chief-ross-nothing-improper-about-his-russia-tied-investments-idUSKBN1D516X

But the president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the government’s Brexit strategy reminded him of a soap opera with a different episode each week and that Britain was less united than the EU’s 27 other states.

“Brexit is only 508 days away, but for many businesses their alarm clocks are set earlier than that: They’re set to the moment they’ll actually enact their contingency plans,” CBI President Paul Drechsler said just before May spoke.

“The clock is ticking, so government and the EU need to get a move on... First of all sorting out, with clarity, details on a transitional arrangement.”

A top executive with U.S. automaker Ford also warned of the negative impact a continuing lack of clarity could have.

“If business conditions moving forward mean the UK is not competitive, then we will have to make the decision to adjust and do something else,” said Steven Armstrong, Ford’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa.

“Which is why it’s very important that we get a clear view of what the final agreement (with the EU) is going to be and assurances that we have the transition agreement for a period of time so we can plan and adjust accordingly.”

BT (BT.L), Britain’s biggest telecoms company, said unless businesses were clear by early 2018 about the terms of a transition they would need to plan for a damaging “hard Brexit”.

CLIFF-EDGE

Ever since the June 2016 EU referendum, business leaders have been calling on the government to give them clarity about how Brexit will look, though ministers say that is impossible, given that the exit terms have still to be negotiated.

“I know how important it is for business and industry not to face a cliff-edge and to have the time it needs to plan and prepare for the new arrangements,” May told the CBI conference.

“I want us to agree the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible.”

But May, who recently unnerved executives by saying any transitional deal would not be agreed until the entire exit agreement is sealed, had little detail on timing.

“We are in a negotiation with the European Union ... First of all we need to get full agreement that this is something that will happen, and then we’ll need to negotiate the details,” she said in response to a question from Reuters.

“Of course, some of those details, you need to know what the end state is, what that future partnership is, because this is about practical change.”

May’s Brexit minister has said previously he wants an outline transitional deal in early 2018.

Almost two in three British firms will have implemented contingency plans by March if Britain and the EU have not struck a transitional deal by then, a CBI survey said. Another survey said most European businesses plan to cut back orders from British suppliers because of the slow progress of Brexit talks.

While Britain’s economy has shown unexpected resilience since the Brexit vote, there are signs of weakness including slowing growth and accelerating inflation.

Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say Britain will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as an undemocratic and costly experiment in European integration they say is doomed to fail.

But companies have warned that Britain could crash out of the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal, imperiling cross-border supply chains, business orders and jobs.",UK business demands Brexit clarity but PM May provides none,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-may/uk-business-demands-brexit-clarity-but-may-provides-none-idUKKBN1D514L?il=0

Kim has traded insults and nuclear threats with U.S. President Donald Trump for months, raising concerns that the Games, due to be held at an alpine resort 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most heavily fortified border, could be marred by political tensions, or worse.

Economic sanctions on the reclusive nation are mounting but the sporting world and South Korea are doing everything in their power to try to coax Pyongyang to accept an invitation to the Games and relieve geopolitical tensions that have hurt ticket sales.

“We are doing our utmost for the North’s participation,” said Song Ki-hun, a lawmaker with South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s party. “But Kim Jong Un is very unpredictable,” added Song. He is based near the Games venue and sits on a special parliamentary committee to support the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Kim, a basketball fan who counts former NBA star Dennis Rodman as a friend, has boosted spending on sports as part of his ambition to turn the North into a ""sports power.""

If the North joins the Games, it would mark the first time in post-war Olympic history that a country has hosted a team from a nation with which it is officially at war. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

The last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, the 1988 summer Games in Seoul, North Korea’s founding father, Kim Il Sung, boycotted them after a plan to co-host them fell apart.

“With North Korea there, things will be smoother,” said a European official from a winter sports federation, asking not to be identified because of the political sensitivity of the subject. “The Games will only be really successful if they are smooth. If the United States, North Korea and China all have their teams in South Korea then that will be a success.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the prospect of U.S. athletes competing with North Korea, a country Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” if provoked.

North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and South Korea to join the Games. But Games officials have said the North could wait until shortly before the Games to say whether it will join.

The IOC said its help so far has mainly been with travel and competition costs, and it will consider wild-card entries for those who do not meet qualification standards.

Seoul has said it is even open to forming a unified North-South ice hockey team. Pyongyang’s IOC representative dismissed that idea in a recent media interview, but a South Korean culture ministry official said Seoul had not abandoned it.

Seoul’s other gestures include a rare proposal for North Korean athletes to enter the South by walking across the border at Panmunjom, the tense and heavily guarded “truce village” where the 1953 armistice was signed.

GOING FOR GLORY

Kim Jong Un, grandson of founder Kim Il Sung, has made sport a major focus of his plan to improve living standards. Since he assumed power in 2011, spending on sport in the nation’s annual budgets has risen faster than most other areas, according to state media reports.

The reports, which only give percentage data, include a record 17 percent jump in funding in 2014 when Kim set out his ambition for sports in an open letter to his Workers’ Party.

He urged the party and athletes to help make sport part of daily life and uphold “the party’s plan of building our country into a sports power, sweat more in training in order to bring glory to the country by winning gold medals.”

He also had school textbooks revised to say that he began shooting a gun at age 3, was off-road driving before turning 8, and had twice beaten foreign master mariners in ship races, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, the think tank of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service in Seoul. Reuters could not verify that report.

Simon Cockerell, head of Beijing-based Koryo Tours, which has brought competitors to the North for events ranging from the Pyongyang Marathon to Frisbee-throwing and cricket, said he had noticed an increasing focus on sports under Kim.

“More events seem to be happening, DPRK sports teams are traveling more than ever, and success is celebrated more than before,” said Cockerell, using the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

At the 2014 Asian Games in South Korea, North Korea’s athletes won 11 gold medals, ranking sixth, and were welcomed with a victory parade and a banquet with Kim who thanked them for validating the “party’s plan for building a sports powerhouse.”

The North is developing sports grounds and arenas, according to Curtis Melvin, of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, where satellite imagery is used to map the North’s economic development.

“Satellite imagery shows lots of park renovation and construction of skate and sports parks, even in very remote areas,” Melvin said.

Kim Jong Un, who studied in the Swiss capital Bern and according to former classmates went on school ski trips in the Alps, has already built a ski resort.

HOCKEY STICKS

So far, only two North Korean athletes have qualified for the Games: figure-skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, whose routines have been set to music by The Beatles and Ginette Reno’s “Je ne suis qu‘une chanson.”

An IOC official said others could qualify for cross-country skiing, and possibly speed skating and biathlon, a combination of skiing and shooting.

Even if they do not, Games organizing committee chief Lee Hee-beom told Reuters athletes may be invited to compete - a common Olympics practice to encourage participation by underdogs, for instance athletes from a tropical country in a winter sport. One famous example brought a Jamaican bobsleigh team to Calgary in 1988. That inspired a movie based on their exploits.

An extra problem for North Korea could be sanctions. In March last year, the U.N. Security Council added “recreational sports equipment” to a list of luxury goods banned from export to the state. North Korea’s National Sports Guidance Committee has accused Washington of using the United Nations to stretch “its tentacles deep into the area of sports.”

When the North Korean ice hockey team arrived in New Zealand last April for the World Championships, the sport’s international body arranged to equip them with 50 new sticks which it would be impossible to export to the North, a New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation official said.

The team handed back the sticks at the airport on their way home, a New Zealand Customs Service spokeswoman said.",Kim Jong Un's love of sport could be making of Games,https://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-2018-northkorea/olympics-kim-jong-uns-love-of-sport-could-be-making-of-games-idINKBN1D6123

The move, on the eve of a visit to Washington by Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, came almost a month after U.S. missions in Turkey suspended all non-immigrant visa services following Turkey’s arrest of a U.S. consulate employee.

Within hours of the U.S. announcement on Oct. 8, Turkey said it was implementing reciprocal measures and President Tayyip Erdogan later angrily accused Washington of sacrificing a longstanding alliance with Ankara.

“The U.S. Mission in Turkey has resumed processing visas on a limited basis,” the embassy said in an email seen by Reuters on Monday, adding that appointments would be limited and could lead to long waiting times.

A U.S. embassy worker in Ankara confirmed the decision to Reuters. The lira firmed to 3.8356 at 1533 GMT, from 3.8708 beforehand.

“The decision came right before PM Yildirim’s visit to the U.S., showing that Turkey-US agreed on a mutual solution regarding the visa service crisis,” Ozgur Altug, chief economist at brokerage BGC Partners, said in a note.

The gains in the lira, which was also boosted by central bank measures on dollar liquidity earlier on Monday, helped push Istanbul's main BIST stock index .XU100 up 2.58 percent on Monday to close at a record high of 114.165,67 points.

In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and, more recently, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year’ failed coup. The U.S. Embassy has said the accusations are baseless.

Turkish police want to question a third worker based in Istanbul. His wife and daughter were detained over alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the abortive putsch. They were later released.

Turkey has been angered by what it sees as U.S. reluctance to hand over Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition.

Gulen denies any involvement in the failed coup.

Turkey has also been enraged by Washington’s support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

No. 2: A woman walks across the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts May 16, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.
