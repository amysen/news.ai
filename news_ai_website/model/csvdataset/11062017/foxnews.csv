The 56-year-old actor told The Sunday Times Hollywood isn’t a priority for him anymore.

“Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I’m 56,” explained Clooney. “I’m not the guy that gets the girl anymore. I shouldn’t be the guy that gets the girl.”

However, there’s a more obvious reason why the father of 5-month-old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting.

“[But], look, if somebody’s got Paul Newman in ‘The Verdict,’ I’d jump,” he said. “But there aren’t that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f-----g dollars. I don’t need money.”

Back in June, Clooney confirmed that he and his business partners – nightlife businessman Rande Gerber and real estate mogul Mike Meldeman – sold their tequila company Casamigos for $1 billion.

“I have money,” said Clooney. “So I can fight to make movies I want to make. If you look at what I’ve been in over the past 15 years, for the most part they weren’t going to get made if I didn’t do them. Nobody was going to make ‘Good Night, and Good Luck,’ ‘Michael Clayton’ or ‘Up in the Air,’ and I fought to get those out there.”

Clooney admitted the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he’s not ready to tackle that role.

“So many people since Trump were elected [and] have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,” he explained. “I don’t have political aspirations.”

He added, “I have always been involved in politics. My father ran for Congress. It’s been in our family forever. But, mostly, I can help in ways I actually know very well, like messaging [voters].”",George Clooney explains why he's taking a break from acting: 'I don't need money',https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/george-clooney-explains-why-hes-taking-break-from-acting-dont-need-money.html

Anok Yai, 19, of Manchester, NH, was attending a homecoming event on Oct. 21 at Howard University in Washington, D.C., when photographer Steven Hall asked to take her photo for his Instagram account.

Hall, an alumnus of Howard who works at the school, told The Washington Post he photographs things “he finds interesting.”

“I wanted to do as many shoots as possible and to take as many photos of fashionable Howard students as I could,” Hall told The Washington Post. “My goal was to get 50 or 75 dope photos.”

Hall said he bumped into Yai and asked to take a few photos of her.

The Plymouth State University student said she was born in Egypt until she moved to the U.S. at age 2. She said her family’s heritage is Sudanese.

Yai said the outpouring she has received from the viral photo was overwhelming.

“There was one day where I had a bunch of classes, and I had done about three to four interviews, and my sister kept saying here’s another one, and here’s another one,” she said.

“And I was nervous because I had just gone from being a random girl living in New Hampshire to an Instagram famous model. I wasn’t sure if I could handle all the expectations.”

The biochemistry student told the Boston Globe she was considering modeling part-time.

Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

Without debate, it was a gunman who perpetrated the evil in San Antonio. So it's man and not God? Which brings me to the next question, ""Why didn't God make better creatures?”

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The act didn't just happen; the law of causality teaches us that every event has a cause.

Investigators will spend countless hours trying to understand the motive behind the murder. In the end, the conclusion will be similar to other investigations. The shooter will be found to be unstable, using anti-depressants or inconclusive.

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The reason that immoral acts bother us and get our attention is that we are moral creatures who know the difference between good and evil.

Jesus made a shocking statement about Judas, the one who betrayed him, ""it would be better for him if he had not been born.""

It's shocking on to think Jesus would make such a statement and equally shocking that Jesus, knowing the world would be better without Judas, allowed Judas to remain.

What is there about good and evil that we don't understand? Is it necessary for both to co-exist, at least for a season? Does evil cause us to strive for good and in our striving permit us to find good? Does God permit evil in this world as a way to produce the best in us? That seems like God is using an illegitimate ""end justifies the means"" ethic.

There is something about evil that drives us to God. Atheist Jean-Paul Sartre said, ""I needed God...I reached out for religion; I longed for it, it was the remedy. Had it been denied me, I would have invented it for myself.”

As a pastor, I struggle to explain the ""why"" behind the senseless evil acts that we witness as human beings. Simple answers to complex questions are bound to be wrong.

So what am I to do? I can give the pat answers that weary all of us, or I can admit my struggle, confront evil and seek to extend the love of God in both good and bad times.","Texas church shooting: God, evil and a senseless act",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/texas-church-shooting-god-evil-and-senseless-act.html

FOX NEWS - The gunman suspected of opening fire at a church in Texas on Sunday has been identified to Fox News as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.

Kelley, according to officials, killed at least 26 people and wounded approximately 20 after he unleashed a hail of bullets in the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, in the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history.

The gunman previously served in the U.S. Air Force, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. Kelley served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and his child. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, in addition to confinement for 12 months and was reduced in rank.

Kelley worked as a security guard for a Texas waterpark this past summer, according to a resume under his name that appears online.

Investigators said Kelley didn't appear to be connected to any organized terrorist groups.

The suspect, who is believed to be from New Braunfels, a suburb outside San Antonio, was found dead in his car after he sped away from the scene of the shooting. Officials said it remained unclear whether he was shot dead by police or an armed nearby resident, or if he died from a self-inflicted wound.

Police didn’t name Kelley during a press conference, but only described him as a white male in his 20s.

Kelley was dressed in black tactical gear and wearing a ballistic vest when he arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church around 11:20 a.m., investigators said.",Texas Church Shooting: Who Is Gunman Devin Patrick Kelley?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/06/texas-church-shooting-who-gunman-devin-patrick-kelley

Since then, as news trickles in, celebrities have been utilizing their social media to share messages online. While most offer their condolences, others have been quick to politicize the incident to call for more gun control in the United States.

Comedian Chelsea Handler was among the first to react to the incident, blaming republicans for the incident saying: “Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.”

Britney Spears offered thoughts and prayers for the community saying, “My heart breaks over the news coming out of Texas. My prayers are with the Sutherland Springs community.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook shared those sentiments saying, “Shocked and sorrowed by the heartbreaking news from Texas. Prayers for all those touched by violence today: victims, survivors, worshippers.”

“Texas... we love you. This is truly awful. Sending my deepest condolences to everyone affected. Something must be done,” Victoria Justice wrote.

“Local official says 27 people were shot and killed, dozens injured. Heart with Sutherland Springs, Texas at this terrible time,” Mia Farrow said.

Piers Morgan shared the numbers saying, “The population of Sutherland Springs is 643. At least 50 of them just got shot. That's one in 12 of the entire community. #SanAntonio.""

Comedian Bob Saget got serious about the incident saying, “My heart hurts for the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. This has to stop.”

“Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again. May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace,” wrote singer Josh Groban.

“No words. My heart is broken for Sutherland Springs, TX and for 2017 America. Please let’s all come together,” wrote comedian Sarah Silverman.

Others focused their thoughts less on the victims and community and more on calling for gun control.

Writer and director Adam McKay wrote, “Mass carnage in Sutherland Springs. We can do better than this. The idea of zero new gun safety laws isn’t just idiotic it’s murderous.”

“Prayers for #SanAntonio and all the families who are suffering the loss of loved ones. I’ll pray also for #GunControl,” said Lady Gaga.

Debra Messing called on congress directly saying, “CONGRESS- the Horror of #SutherlandSprings is on YOU. BAN #gunstocks NOW. Las Vegas was basically Yesterday! Shameful, complicit,no excuses.”

Consider the increasing number of claims that the incendiary allegations of the dossier ""check out,"" in the words of New York Times columnist Bret Stephens.

Bankrolled by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, guided by the dirt-digging opposition research firm Fusion GPS, and compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele, the dossier's key allegation is this: ""There was a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership."" Steele attributed that claim to ""Source E,"" whom he described as ""an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""

""What's relevant is [Steele's] credibility, the reliability of his sources and the truthfulness of their claims,"" Stephens wrote recently. ""These check out.""

But do they? In reality, most reasonable people not named Mueller would have to say we don't know.

""As it relates to the Steele dossier, unfortunately the committee has hit a wall,"" Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr noted last month. The committee's investigation, the best probe outside of the Mueller special prosecutor operation, has not even been able to discover who Steele's sources were, Burr said.

So how do outsiders conclude that the document's key allegations check out? How do they know what they know?",Byron York: Spinning in Circles on the Trump Dossier,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/06/byron-york-spinning-circles-trump-dossier#commenting

Here’s what you need to know about the scandal:

Who is Kirt Webster?

Webster, 43, is a Nashville publicist who was the president and CEO of Webster PR. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

Webster has worked in the music industry in Nashville for over 20 years. In addition to clients like Dolly Parton, his firm has also helped artists like George Jones and Kenny Rogers with their marketing campaigns.

Who is Austin Rick?

Austin Rick, whose stage name is Austin Cody, is originally from Waldorf, Maryland, but moved to Nashville to persue his music career. Rick claims Webster began sexually harassing and assaulting him in 2008.

After a year of alleged sexual assault and harassment by Webster, Rick moved back to Maryland and stepped away from his career, according to the Tennessean.

After ending his country career, Rick attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He graduated in May with a degree in sociology.

Despite moving away, Rick has said that Webster has allegedly tried to contact him as recently as this year.

Rick created a GoFundMe page on Oct. 31 to help pay for his legal fees as he prepares to take Webster to court over the allegations.

Rick said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook.

He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Rick said he was inspired to share his story after the #MeToo social media movement went viral, which began after countless allegations against famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light.

What has happened since Rick came forward?

Webster has denied Rick’s claims. Since then, many of Webster’s former employees have stepped forward with harassment allegations against him. One ex-employee, a man who requested anonymity, told Fox News “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.”

Another female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions.

Many former employees also detailed stories of unwanted physical contact. And, in addition to Rick, other men have come forward with allegations against Webster.

'HOUSE OF CARDS' CREW MEMBERS CLAIM KEVIN SPACEY ROUTINELY SEXUALLY HARASSED PEOPLE ON SET

Cody Anderson, 33, told Fox News on Wednesday that Webster propositioned him for sex while he was working as an intern for Webster PR in 2010.

Webster did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment on the allegations.

What's happening now?

Police are not pursuing Rick’s charges against Webster because a statute of limitations prevents them from doing so, the Tennessean reported.

However, in addition to Parton, Rock, and Cyrus, many of Webster’s clients have also left the company. Those artists include: Justin Moore, Naomi Judd, Charlie Daniels and more.

Parton tweeted Friday that she “hopes the accusations are not true.”",Kirt Webster accused of sexual harassment: What to know about the claims,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/kirt-webster-accused-sexual-harassment-what-to-know-about-claims.html

During his visit in Hawaii, Trump was expected to meet with the U.S. Pacific Command to discuss the escalating threat from North Korea. He was also scheduled to meet with the governors of Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific U.S. territories, which are all relatively close targets if North Korea opts for a missile strike aganst the U.S.

Trump will head to Japan on Saturday, then make subsequent stops in South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, where the looming crisis in North Korea will likely remain a key topic of discussion.

The Legion has previously called on the Drug Enforcement Agency to reclassify marijuana to recognize it as ""a drug with potential medical value.”

In August during the group's national convention in Nevada, the group passed a resolution calling on the federal government to allow medical providers within the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss medical cannabis as a treatment option in states where medical marijuana is legal.

At a news conference Thursday announcing the results of the study, Legion Executive Director Verna Jones said the group is ""not advocating for recreational use of marijuana, but we are advocating for the removal of cannabis from Schedule One of the Controlled Substances Act so that more medical investigators can do research.""

The removal of marijuana from the list of ""Schedule One"" drugs, which includes heroin and Ecstasy, would place it in a different category of drugs deemed to have no medical use.

The second generation of its autonomous vehicles is being developed on Uber’s test track, an Uber spokeswoman told Fox News.

Uber's self-driving vehicles made their debut in Pittsburgh in 2016 and have been picking up passengers ever since.

Current models require one or two vehicle operators, Uber Hardware Engineer Brian Zajac told Fox News. An Uber employee sits in the driver's seat and is ready to take over the vehicle when the computer system tells the opertator it needs to go off self-driving mode. Another employee sits in the passenger seat monitoring a map that displays what the vehicle's sensors see in real-time, including bikers, pedestrians and other vehicles. Customers can see what the car ""sees"" through an iPad provided in the back seat.

The next generation is a step closer to having no vehicle operators, Zajac said.

“In the far future, there won’t be any vehicle operator,” Zajac said. “The car rolls up, there’s no human inside at all, and the customer gets in and takes a ride.”

Some of the more immediate changes, which will be incorporated into the third generation of autonomous vehicles, are not easily visible.

“From the outside, a lot looks the same, but under the hood, we’ve made a whole bunch of improvements,” Zajac said.

One of those improvements is a higher resolution set of cameras.

“That extra resolution allows the sensors to see a little bit farther which allows the system to drive a little bit faster,” Zajac said.

The cameras will also have a better cleaning system for inclement weather.

“It’s been redesigned to handle heavier rain and to handle other types of contamination that gets on our cameras,” Zajac said.

The camera system will also have fewer parts to assemble, which would make it easier to mass produce in the future.

Current models have limited trunk space that’s shared with computer equipment. The new version will give passengers the full trunk space of the vehicle.

“You’ll see it’s a nice big open trunk that you can throw all of your luggage, jump in the car and go to the airport or wherever you might be headed,” Zajac said.

For now, Uber’s newest release will not change the passenger experience too much, a spokeswoman said.

Zajac said the engineers will keep pushing toward the goal of full autonomy.

“This is kind of uncharted territory for a lot of companies but there’s a lot of really good other industries we can draw from such as aerospace and the automotive industry,” he said.",Uber prepares next generation of self-driving cars,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/03/uber-prepares-next-generation-self-driving-cars.html

Daughters Emily and Megan had finished third and first in their respective categories in a 4-H bakeoff and displayed their handiwork in posted photos.

But on Sunday afternoon, the page went grim.

""Keep the Holcombe family in your prayers,"" a friend posted.

Crystal Holcombe, who was eight months pregnant, was among the 26 people killed by a lone gunman wielding an assault rifle, most inside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, according to her cousin, Nick Uhlig.

Uhlig told The Associated Press that Holcombe's in-laws were killed, and he told the Houston Chronicle that three of Holcombe's children also died.

""She doesn't even drink, smoke or nothing,"" he told the newspaper. ""She just takes care of kids; she raises goats and makes homemade cheese. That kind of thing, you know? They don't go out dancing or anything like that. They're real old-fashioned, down-to-earth.""

The father-in-law, Bryan Holcombe, had done prison ministry, Uhlig said. ""He would go up to the prison with a ukulele to sing.""

The massacred churchgoers ranged in age from 5 to 72, state police said. About 20 others were wounded.

One local man, 68-year-old Earl Good, told the San Antonio Express-News that a good friend had lost eight relatives in the shooting.

It's not clear whether the Holcombes were that family.

Another victim was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, daughter of the church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy. Both he and his wife were out of town, in different states, on Sunday.

""Heaven truly gained a real beautiful angel this morning along with many more,"" the girl's uncle, Scott Pomeroy, lamented on his Facebook page, posting a picture of the smiling girl poolside in a bathing suit. All those robbed of life in Sunday's bloodbath, he wrote, ""have taken their last breath of dirty air and took their first breath of heavenly air with new bodies with no pain and suffering.""

Another of those killed was the 13-year-old goddaughter of Amanda Mosel, she told the Express-News.

Hank Summers, a local who had moved to San Antonio, told the AP via text message that his uncle, David Colbath, survived five gunshots that required extensive surgery and skin grafts to save an arm.

Sutherland Springs is a tiny town where everyone knows each other, said L.G. Moore, who runs the Holiday RV Park, which is ¼ mile from the church.

Everyone in town was apt to know someone who was killed, he ventured.

""They say the population is 400 and that's if you count every dog, cat and armadillo. It's more like 200 people,"" the 75-year-old Moore said by phone.

A sneaky app maker pretended to be the actual WhatsApp service with an app called Update WhatsApp Messenger. But it copped the developer title ""WhatsApp Inc.""—the same title the actual Facebook-owned chat messenger uses on Google Play.

The only difference was the app maker added a Unicode character space after the WhatsApp Inc. name. In a computer code the difference is more obvious—it reads WhatsApp+Inc%C2%A0. But to average Android users browsing Google Play, that character space would be easy to miss.

Reddit users spotted the problem on Friday. The dummy app was not a chat app, but served users with ads to download other apps. As Motherboard noted, Avast researcher Nikolaos Chrysaidos pointed out that it was downloaded at least 1 million times.

The dummy app's developer is unknown, but the culprit later changed the name of the app to ""Dual Whatsweb Update,"" and removed the ""WhatsApp Inc."" developer title. It has since been removed from Google Play.

""I can confirm that the app was removed from Google Play and the developer account was suspended for violating our program polices,"" a Google spokesperson said Friday.

Fake Android apps are nothing new, and they're often used to spread malware on mobile phones. But the WhatsApp dummy product incident is worrisome because it doesn't appear that Google noticed the problem. Google Play rules don't allow apps to impersonate another brand title or logo. In addition, the company has been using new security measures to prevent malware from entering the platform.

Hackers have used similar tricks, like using Cyrillic alphabet letters in the place of English letters, to create legitimate-looking domain names.

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

What are we to think when the sacred things of society are disregarded and become the site of evil? Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

""The alcohol component is broken down and reduced, so as long as it isn't completely oxidized, cooking with it is probably fine,"" Montagano explains.","This is the year you finally decide to make proper cocktails at home. Your bar cart is stocked with the best gin and all the ingredients for a negroni, and you're ready to get shakin'.

Guess what? You've already messed up. Because one major ingredient in a negroni is going to spoil quickly if you don't get it in the fridge, stat.

Base spirits like vodka, gin, and whiskey — once you start making cocktails, you'll start using phrases like base spirits too — don't have to be refrigerated, but anything wine-based will oxidize and go rancid at room temperature. If you've ever left a bottle of re-corked wine on the counter for a week, you know the despair of musty-smelling, funky-tasting booze gone bad. And if you're investing in an aperitif like vermouth, you want to make them last for as many cocktails as you can.

We chatted with Meaghan Montagano, the bar director and general manager at NYC's Casa Pública to find out the alcohol that you need to refrigerate — and ways to use it up more quickly. (Hint: it involves more drinking. A hardship.)

Vermouth

There should be an extra step when making a Manhattan: Put the vermouth in the fridge. Oxygen hits the liquid immediately after the bottle is opened. Whether it's dry vermouth (maybe you're making a Fifty-Fifty Martini), sweet red vermouth (for Negronis), or the in between bianco (for a new twist on a Negroni), it needs to go in the fridge. Montagano notes that the sweeter reds will last a little longer, but don't let it go longer than a month. ""If you go to a dive bar and there's Martini & Rossi on the bar, you know your Negroni will be trash,"" she adds. To know if something has gone bad, be sure to taste a sip when you first open the bottle. It should be bright and complex. As it oxidizes, it will be flat and dull, and when it's really bad, it could smell like a wet dog. This rule applies for any wine product.

Sherry and Port

Sherry is tougher to give a time frame on how long it can stay in the fridge, but it should definitely be cold as long as you have it. Montagano suggests buying a smaller bottle, like a 375 ml, to test out how much you'll use it. Fortified wines typically last the longest — Pedro Ximenez, a hearty, sweet dessert Sherry, could go for three months — but some more delicate varieties like Fino could spoil after a week. The same applies to Port, another fortified wine.

Marsala and Madeira

If you have a little Marsala or Madeira wine as an after-dinner drink, tuck it away in the fridge afterward. The good news is that if you use that same Marsala to cook chicken Marsala with later, you'll have a little wiggle room to let it sit for a month or two in the fridge. ""The alcohol component is broken down and reduced, so as long as it isn't completely oxidized, cooking with it is probably fine,"" Montagano explains. The flavor just won't be as bright. The same rule applies to that bottle of white wine sitting in the fridge for a few weeks — use it for clam sauce if it hasn't turned!

Apertifs Like Lillet and Cocchi Americano

French Lillet is a smoother, floral, citrusy aperitif that you can drink on its own or in a Bond-approved Vesper martini, while Italian Cocchi Americano is more bitter and better paired simply with club soda and orange. No matter which you prefer in your Corpse Reviver No. 2 cocktail, they both need to stay in the fridge. Montagano recommends either over ice with a lemon twist. Lillet Rouge (red) will last the longest — up to a month — while the Blanc and Rosé styles will only go for a few weeks. Alternatively, Cocchi Rosa, the red-wine-based aperitif, will last longer than the white varietal.

Cream Liqueur

Spike your eggnog with Baileys or Kahlua, but put it in the fridge. It's probably already there — because who wants to drink warm Baileys?! — but just in case, we need you to know. Montagano recommends trying El Dorado Golden Rum Cream, which is made with aged rum and has a toffee-like flavor.

Now that your fridge is going to be full of aperitifs and fortified wines, don't use them only for cocktails — try a glass on the rocks with a twist of citrus. Low ABV drinks are popular in Europe and ideal for day-drinking. And if you'd rather go big, make a punch or sangria when something is starting to turn.",5 types of alcohol that belong in the refrigerator,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/11/06/5-types-alcohol-that-belong-in-refrigerator.html

They’re walking them, caravan-style, back to the Hilltop where they expect Maggie to figure out what to do with them.","Rick’s first offensive against Negan and the Saviors is certainly an eventful one. The war for supremacy continued as unintended consequences took shape in Season 8, Episode 3, “Monsters.”

The episode opens right where last week’s left off. King Ezekiel is giving a rousing speech to the members of The Kingdom explaining that, despite the fact that the Saviors are sending a team to their position and are aware of their impending attack, they’re not going to lose a single person in the fray. Say what one will about his propensity for speaking like a Shakespearean actor, the dialect really gets one amped up for a fight. Through some trickery, they dispatch the team that was coming to kill them with ease and move forward.

Meanwhile, we find Rick at the end of Morales’ gun barrel. Fans will remember the Season 1 character, who didn’t tag along with Rick and company to the CDC, was revealed last week to be a Savior. Rick tries to get him to understand what’s going on, but from Morales’ perspective, Rick is a straight up monster who just killed a father. He explains that Negan killed Glenn, the man who, presumably, helped save Morales’ life in the beginning of the apocalypse. Morales counters by explaining that he lost his family too, and was willing to die. That’s when the Saviors found him and gave him a purpose.

That purpose appears to be pretty high up in the ranks, as he not only orders reinforcements, but orders the Saviors that are fighting Aaron and the Alexandrians outside to retreat and come take care of Rick and anyone else inside. Also inside is Daryl, who stumbles upon Rick and Morales and takes the latter out without giving it a second thought. Unfortunately, it’s way too late and the men are inside.

Meanwhile, Jesus and Morgan are dealing with the fallout of taking a whole lot of unexpected prisoners. They’re walking them, caravan-style, back to the Hilltop where they expect Maggie to figure out what to do with them. Morgan, however, is being taunted by Jared, the savior who killed his young friend. Just when he’s about to snap and make the call to execute him on his own, walkers descend upon them. In the confusion, Jared leads a group away. Fortunately, they don’t get far as they’re all tied together. Morgan arrives and executes one. He’s about to pull the trigger on Jared when Jesus stops him.

They argue, with Morgan doing a hairpin morality turn and demanding that they end the Saviors and treat the war as a purge. Jesus insists that after war will be peace, and tells Morgan he’ll have to learn to live with these people when it’s all over.

That doesn’t sit well with Morgan, who is in full berserker mode at this point. The two martial arts experts find themselves in a fist fight in front of an audience of prisoners. Luckily, Morgan’s sharpened staff isn't as pointy as it used to be. In an impressive demonstration of combat and discipline, Jesus bests his opponent. When it’s over, Morgan snaps back to reality, apparently having little memory of what just happened.

“I’m not right,” he acknowledges. “But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

He says that he can’t be a part of Jesus’ prisoner march, and goes off in search of Jared and the others, who seized the opportunity to scamper off into the woods. Although their bad guys, it's hard to blame them for taking off.

Back at the compound, Aaron has returned to the battle at the behest of his wounded husband, Eric. The two said bye to each other so that Aaron could be where he’s needed, leading the Alexandrians in an effort to rescue Rick and Daryl. His moment comes just in time as the duo found themselves battling with just their fists by the time their team arrived. They manage to clean things up at the compound, securing yet another victory for the good guys. Although the weapons cache they were after wasn’t there.

When things are clear, Aaron returns to the tree he left Eric to find him gone. He looks in the distance and sees a walker joining a herd. He breaks down and is pulled away by an ally.

Meanwhile, back at the Hilltop, Gregory arrives looking for safe haven. Maggie greets him at the gate with every intention of banishing him from his own community. He tries to make a case that he’s actually done the right thing, but Maggie is no one’s fool. It’s not until he actually begs for his life and reminds Maggie that she’s not a killer that she breaks and lets him in. It’s not a moment too soon as Jesus then arrives with a cadre of prisoners and a gigantic problem. Gregory and Tara protest, but Jesus suggests sticking them in two trailers with around-the-clock guards until the war is over.

He really puts Maggie in a tough place as she either has to become a bloodthirsty ogre, or jeopardize the lives of the people in The Hilltop. It’s unclear what she decides, but the episode does not end with the “Walking Dead” version of a firing squad, so it seems like she accepted the prisoners.

The episode, instead, ends with Rick rescuing the baby whose father he killed. He says he has a stop to make, presumably having to do with the polaroids and letter he was writing, when Aaron asks to take on the task of caring for the baby. He lost Eric, and he tells Rick that he really has to take care of the baby, for reasons he doesn’t understand.

Just when it looks like everything is on the rise, Daryl and Rick are shot at by a rogue survivor of the Saviors. Rick tells him that they don’t have time to fight and that a herd is coming. He gives the shooter his word that he’ll let him go if he tells them where the guns are. He says they’re at the outpost being hit by the Kingdom. Daryl makes a liar out of Rick and executes the shooter before they make haste to help Carol and the gang.

As Ezekiel is declaring victory, his people are mowed down by the guns in question. The episode ends before any real casulty count can be had, but Ezekiel seems safe as about five of his loyal subjects sacrifice themselves for him.","'The Walking Dead' Season 8, Episode 3 recap: Deaths rise as the war continues",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/05/walking-dead-season-8-episode-3-recap-deaths-rise-as-war-continues.html

When Katie Michael's water broke during evening rush hour last Friday, the Pennsylvania nurse knew she wouldn't make it to the hospital where she works in time for delivery:

(Katie) ""I knew that she was going to be born in the car because she started coming out.""

So Michael put her professional skills to good use, delivering her own baby outside of the hospital in Harrisburg while her husband George Michael ran in for help:

Located in the Timna Valley in Israel, ancient Egyptians and others in the region used the mines for copper mining. Early archaeologists and explorers believed that King Solomon, an ancient Israeli ruler, controlled the Timna mines. However, many scholars now think the claim is unlikely.

Archaeologists discovered the pregnant woman's skeleton buried in a tumulus (a tomb covered by rocks) near Hathor's temple. The people worshipped Hathor — the goddess of love, pleasure and maternity — at Timna, and considered her to be the protector of the miners. [See Photos of the Burial and Skeletal Remains in Timna Valley]

At the time the pregnant woman lived, Egypt controlled the mines at Timna, suggesting she was Egyptian. In addition, she may have been a singer at the Hathor temple, said Erez Ben-Yosef, the director of the Central Timna Valley Project and a senior lecturer in archaeology at Tel Aviv University. She was buried with beads whose design is similar to those found at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef told Live Science.

An examination of her remains indicates she was in her early 20s and in the first trimester of her pregnancy when she died. The cause of her death is unknown.

The woman likely accompanied one of the mining expeditions sent to the Timna Valley to extract copper; she would have served in the Hathor temple while mining operations were underway. The rituals and ceremonies performed at the temple were important, since Hathor was thought to protect the miners.

It's not known whether the woman traveled to Timna from Egypt while she was pregnant or whether she was impregnated while serving at the Hathor temple, Ben-Yosef said. ""Probably she wouldn't have traveled if she knew she was pregnant, but this is only a guess.

Egypt's power in the Timna area weakened in the century after the woman died, and Egypt eventually lost control of the mines to other groups in the region.

Other findings in Timna Valley include preserved leftovers from a mining camp called Slaves' Hill. Those leftovers suggested the metalworkers ate meals of sheep and goat, as well as pistachios, grapes and fish during the 10th century B.C. More recently at Slaves' Hill, scientists revealed the remains of a sophisticated gatehouse and donkey stables that suggested the settlement had a highly organized defense system. In another discovery, archaeologists reported in 2013 that they had dug up artifacts in the valley that dated to the time of the biblical King Solomon.

Other research is underway to get a better understanding of the history of Timna.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Leaked documents linking Queen Elizabeth II to offshore investments in tax havens has shined a spotlight on her considerable fortune. Here are five things to know about the queen's finances.

___

JUST HOW RICH IS THE QUEEN?

It's hard to measure precisely because some of her assets are privately held and some are part of the Crown Estate, which is not directly controlled by the monarch. The Sunday Times Rich List estimated Elizabeth's fortune at 360 million pounds ($472 million) based on an analysis of her private holdings, her stock portfolio, money inherited from her late mother, and income from the Crown Estate, a percentage of which is used to generate revenue for her expenses. This analysis doesn't include the rising value of the Crown Estate itself, which is in the billions, because she does not control its investments. This net worth figure would make her the 329th richest person in Britain, far from the top in a list headed by multi-billionaires.

___

DOES THE QUEEN PAY TAXES?

Elizabeth voluntarily agreed to start paying taxes in 1992 after she was harshly criticized in the tabloid press for her continuing tax exemption. The decision to change her tax status was announced in Parliament by Prime Minister John Major and was praised by politicians of both major parties. British monarchs had not always lived tax free — Queen Victoria paid income tax when it was introduced in 1842, but royals gradually received exemptions. King George V, the queen's grandfather, was the last sovereign to pay taxes until Elizabeth agreed to do so. The queen's decision, and a simultaneous reduction of the number of senior royals receiving funding support, helped improve her standing in a difficult period that she memorably dubbed her ""annus horribilus"" — or horrible year — after a series of family troubles and a catastrophic fire at her beloved Windsor Castle.

___

DID SHE DO SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER INVESTMENTS?

Nothing has emerged to suggest that Elizabeth has done anything improper by investing roughly 10 million pounds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda through the Duchy of Lancaster, which manages her private financial affairs. But investing in these regions is often a way to lower tax liability, and the idea that the monarch may be benefiting from tax havens will not sit well with people who feel the royal family already enjoys too many advantages. It doesn't help that some of the investment was in a company that has been accused of exploiting consumers. The Duchy of Lancaster says the queen did not receive any tax breaks through these investments.

___

DOESN'T SHE OWN SOME VALUABLE PAINTINGS? AND A FANCY YACHT?

The Royal Collection is one of the world's greatest troves of fine art. Amassed by wealthy and powerful kings and queens in the last five centuries, it includes more than 1 million works, including priceless paintings by a long list of masters ranging from Rembrandt to Lucien Freud. These works are not the personal possessions of the queen — she is not free to sell them, for example, or to give them away as presents — but she holds the works in trust for the nation and for her successors. Many are loaned out for exhibition in museums and institutions throughout the world. She no longer has a yacht, however. The Britannia was decommissioned in 1997 — and the usually stoic queen shed a tear at the ceremony marking the demise of the last royal yacht.

___

WHAT DOES THE QUEEN COST TAXPAYERS? IS SHE WORTH IT?

Buckingham Palace's latest annual report indicates that maintaining the monarchy costs each taxpayer about 65 pence ($0.85). This is based on the Sovereign Grant, which is public money used to support the official duties carried out by the queen and her family. Palace officials are fond of touting this figure. ""When you consider that against what the queen does and represents for this country, I believe it represents excellent value for money,"" says Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse.",Investment queen: a look at Elizabeth II's fortune,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/06/investment-queen-look-at-elizabeth-iis-fortune.html

“What is this? Is this the person who does the cremation? Is this their name on the paper?' And he goes, ‘Well, no.’ He goes, ‘That’s the deceased's name. That’s your brother’s name,’"" Goodsell said. ""I said, ‘This isn’t my brother.’”

Goodsell had taken the unopened box to a mortuary in Utah, where they realized the mistake. The remains were meant for a family in Massapequa, New York.

“This has just been the worst 75 hours of our lives,” Goodsell told FOX40.

Clint Love, the owner of A Bay Area Crematory, declined a recorded interview with FOX40, saying he preferred that his attorneys do that when they become available.

Love said he is very apologetic and said this sort of thing hasn't happened since they have been in business.

According to FOX40, the business has no open complaints with the Better Business Bureau or the California Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, where their license is in good standing.

But Goodsell says, after this mix-up, she's still not sure how she can trust that the second set of remains, which she received earlier Saturday, are really those of her brother.

“We all have the same feeling. Is this really my brother. Is his really Kevin?” she said, adding that she wants A Bay Area Crematory to pay for DNA testing on the second set of remains to verify their authenticity.",Crematory sends grieving Utah family wrong remains,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/29/crematory-sends-grieving-utah-family-wrong-remains.html

It is not clear whether the search errors are related to the recently-announced revamp of Twitter’s rules, which aims to boost the safety of the site’s users. The move to bolster the safety rules came just days after CEO Jack Dorsey said in a tweetstorm that the company is not doing enough to protect its users.

It's always important to understand how you know what you know, or what you think you know. It's particularly important in the case of the Trump dossier.

Consider the increasing number of claims that the incendiary allegations of the dossier ""check out,"" in the words of New York Times columnist Bret Stephens.

Bankrolled by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, guided by the dirt-digging opposition research firm Fusion GPS, and compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele, the dossier's key allegation is this: ""There was a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership."" Steele attributed that claim to ""Source E,"" whom he described as ""an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""

""What's relevant is [Steele's] credibility, the reliability of his sources and the truthfulness of their claims,"" Stephens wrote recently. ""These check out.""

But do they? In reality, most reasonable people not named Mueller would have to say we don't know.

""As it relates to the Steele dossier, unfortunately the committee has hit a wall,"" Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr noted last month. The committee's investigation, the best probe outside of the Mueller special prosecutor operation, has not even been able to discover who Steele's sources were, Burr said.

Trump was at an event with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo and responded to questions about the shooting Sunday at a Texas church that killed at least 26 and wounded 20.

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

Authorities on Monday were working to determine a motive in the shooting that occured at around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Multiple sources told Fox News the gunman was 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.

Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

Authorities said the gunman wore black tactical gear and a ballistic vest when he pulled into a gas station across from the church. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, where an 11 a.m. service was scheduled.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr., whose territory includes Sutherland Springs, said there was likely ""no way"" for the church congregation to escape once the shooting started.

""You've got your pews on either side. He just walked down the center aisle, turned around and my understanding was shooting on his way back out,"" said Tackitt, who said the shooter also carried a handgun but that he didn't know if it was fired.

Tackitt described the scene inside the church as ""terrible.""

""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,"" Tackitt said. ""I guess it was seeing the children that were killed. It's one thing to see an adult, but to see a 5-year-old ...""

As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line.

Several weapons were found inside the vehicle and Martin said it was unclear if the attacker died of a self-inflicted wound or if he was shot by the resident who confronted him. He said investigators weren't ready to discuss a possible motive. Martin said 23 of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital.

The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened.

""I was strictly just acting on what's the right thing to do,"" Langendorff said.

Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history.

Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy, and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message.

""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as i can.""

Federal agents swarmed the small rural community of a few hundred residents, including ATF investigators and the FBI's evidence collection team.

Later Sunday, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural, western outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio.

Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days.

""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,"" Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video.

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

The Catalan crisis is being called a ""nightmare"" and a ""time bomb"" for Belgium's government.

The outlawed independence referendum in Catalonia hasn't just sparked a political crisis in Spain. The flight of the region's ousted president to Brussels is sowing divisions within the Belgian government and looks set to damage ties between the two European Union partners.

Even as Carles Puigdemont and his lawyer were questioned by an investigating judge on Sunday about his extradition, members of Belgium's government, Belgian politicians and Spanish officials were trading barbs in the mainstream and social media.

Most vocal are members of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party — a key member of Belgium's ruling coalition and whose separatist desires appear to have been inflamed by Puigdemont's most recent drive for Catalan independence from Spain.

""I am just questioning how an EU member state can go this far,"" Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Jambon told the VTM network Sunday, in reference to the jailing of several of Puigdemont's associates in Spain last week.

Puigdemont maintains that his arrival in Brussels is about raising the profile of Catalan nationhood at European level, and not to interfere in Belgian politics, or ""Belgianize"" politics in Catalonia. But his stay is being dubbed ""the Belgian government's nightmare"" in the media.

""The dossier is a time bomb for the federal coalition,"" wrote the daily Le Soir.

Very little criticism of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has been voiced by Spain's 27 EU partner countries, but Belgium did condemn the violence, much of it blamed on police heavy-handedness, that marked the Oct. 1 referendum in Catalonia.

Around 900 people were hurt — nearly all of them minor injuries. Spain's government defended the police response, saying it was proportionate to the resistance officers met on the streets.

""You have Spanish law but also international law, the European Human Rights Treaty and such things and they come ahead of member state law,"" Jambon said. ""I think the international community must keep a close watch.""

On Twitter, a close Rajoy ally and member of the European Parliament, Esteban Gonzalez Pons, wrote that ""a year ago, Jambon who is defending Puigdemont, was justifying collaboration with the Nazis.""

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has tried to stay above the fray, refusing so far to comment on the case of Puigdemont and four of his associates in Belgium.

Still, that hasn't stopped Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders from weighing in.

""There has been excitement around this dossier that exceeds the limits of what is reasonable,"" he told broadcaster RTL. ""Some people are getting involved in Belgium and commenting on the crisis when it's not their role.""

""The first thing to do is keep the dialogue open with Spain,"" Reynders added.

Easier said than done when Belgian politicians are using politically-charged language to compare Rajoy's center-right government in Madrid and the Spanish judiciary to the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco half a century ago.

""You know where the past of the Popular Party is, and ever more its present — and it is Franco, it is repression, it is jailing people because of their opinion, it is the use of violence against its citizens,"" N-VA leader Bart De Wever told the VRT network Monday.

De Wever isn't a member of Michel's center-right government but he speaks for a party that is central to four-party coalition.

Yet even the moderate Socialist opposition in the French-speaking part of Belgium is using similar language.

""Puigdemont has abused his position, but Rajoy is acting like an authoritarian Francoist. Let's find the path to a more federal Spain,"" tweeted Elio Di Rupo, a former prime minister and Socialist leader in Belgium's southern Wallonia region.

Things are only likely to heat up as campaigning for the Dec. 21 regional election in Catalonia gets underway, and Puigdemont starts stumping for re-election from Belgium. Brussels prosecutors confirmed Monday that his provisional release terms allow him to campaign here and talk to the media.

If Puigdemont's lawyer exhausts all avenues of appeal, the ousted leader could be in town until January.

In a column published Monday on the London-based Guardian's website, Puigdemont said the detention of his colleagues in Spain is ""a colossal outrage"" and he vowed to fight for separatist rights.

He said he wants to draw the attention of other EU countries to the crackdown and ""demand a political rather than judicial solution to the problem.""

The specter that Spain's arrest warrant might even be refused is also very real, as a legal precedent exists that raised tensions between Belgium and Spain in the past.

In October 2013, a court in Ghent rejected a Spanish European arrest warrant to extradite a female member of the armed Basque separatist group ETA.

Maria Natividad Jauregui Espina is accused of shooting dead a senior Spanish army officer in 1981. The warrant was refused over serious concerns that her fundamental rights could have been abused by the move.

The 58-year old woman continues to live and work in Belgium. Her lawyer was Paul Bekaert, the man now representing Carles Puigdemont.

First of all, a travel alert is different from a travel warning, and the biggest difference between the two is time.
Temporary situations, such as a disease outbreak or a public demonstration, are among the things that could lead to a travel alert.

When an alert or warning includes a destination you were planning to visit, you likely have questions and concerns. But before you imagine the worst case scenario and cancel a trip, here's what you need to know.

First of all, a travel alert is different from a travel warning, and the biggest difference between the two is time. According to the State Department, an alert is issued when the government recognizes “short-term events” they think you need to be aware of when visiting a country. Temporary situations, such as a disease outbreak or a public demonstration, are among the things that could lead to a travel alert.

More ongoing issues, like a civil war or a rise in crime, are typically what call for a travel warning. When that happens, the U.S. State Department wants you “to consider very carefully whether you should go to a country at all.”

For example, the South Pacific's tropical cyclone season recently got an alert, while Venezuela's ongoing issues with crime and shortages in food and medicine got a warning.

Although this information should never be taken lightly, understanding the events behind both alerts and warnings will give travelers context for planning their own itinerary. One thing to remember is that not every part of a continent or country with a travel advisory is dangerous.

“Countries generally don’t fit in a one-size-fits-all category,” John Rendeiro, Vice President of Global Security and Intelligence at International SOS, told USA Today last year. “Variable levels of risks exist within countries, as there are safer and more dangerous parts of the United States as well.”

As an example from personal experience, I recently visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although the U.S. government advises “to avoid unnecessary travel to the DRC because of ongoing instability and sporadic violence,” I visited the country's Virguna National Park, but I didn’t blow off the recommendations. Prior to finalizing my plans, I e-mailed the park directly, and through our correspondence, a ranger assured me that a member of the park's team would escort me into the Congo at the border and I’d be accompanied by an armed guard throughout the entire trek. Overall, the park was extremely well run and I had no issues doing what I came to do: see the gorillas.

After being a few feet away from a gorilla family and watching one of the babies spin from a tree branch, I'd say it was one the best experiences I’ve ever had.

No matter where travelers go, they should always prioritize their safety and exercise caution. When in a foreign country, keep in mind the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program and the long list of U.S. embassies worldwide, which are there to help and inform citizens of how to handle themselves when visiting other countries.

The Hermit Kingdom, referencing dictator Kim Jong Un, said an “outstanding leader” will determine the country’s destiny. Without “distinguished leadership,” North Korea would have “fallen a victim to the invasion by the barbarous U.S. imperialists.”

The statement comes as Trump heads to South Korea to begin the second stop of his five-country Asia tour. The president joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan on Sunday and Monday, enjoying a casual burger lunch and golf -- and discussing the nuclear crisis. Trump suggested in a news conference the U.S. will arm Japan and declared Pyongyang “a threat to the civilized world.”

""Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last twenty-five years,"" Trump said, with Abe standing next to him.

But as the president prepares to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a report by a South Korean spy agency Thursday said there was “active movement” surrounding a missile research facility in Pyongyang. Vehicles were detected at the facility, renewing fears a test is imminent with Trump slated to be nearby.

North Korea’s last nuclear and missile tests both occurred in September. Its last intermediate-range missile test flew over northern Japan before splashing into the Pacific Ocean.

Trump is expected to spend two days in South Korea, but is not expected to visit the DMZ, the border that has separated North and South Korea for 64 years, because “there is not enough time in the schedule,” a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. Trump will instead visit Camp Humphreys, a military base about 40 miles south of Seoul.

According to the Metro, David and Kathryn Woodruffe made their final landing together at London’s Heathrow Airport after a flight from New York City. Over the course of their careers, the two had flown around a dozen flights together for British Airways.

64-year-old David Woodruffe first joined the airline in 1984 and held the role of captain, but he said his final flight resulted in mixed emotions.

His daughter said the duo always remains 100 percent professional, and their bond helped them in the cockpit.

“I’m sorry to be leaving BA after so many years, but equally glad that she will be remaining in the airline to continue our legacy, and doing a job I know she has the same passion and enthusiasm for as I do,” David Woodruffe told the Metro.

She knew by the age of 12 that she wanted to follow in her father’s footsteps and traveled with him as often as possible, visiting destinations like Barbados, Grand Cayman and Tobago.

“Dad and flying have influenced my life massively, so it’s really special to have been with him at the end of his amazing career,” Kathryn Woodruffe said. “I promised him I will carry on the good Woodruffe name.”

Humans of New York is a page dedicated to photos and stories from New Yorkers. One subject – an anonymous male in the city – was quoted confessing his honest feelings about his relationship.

“We had excellent dates. Everything else about her was exactly what I wanted. I didn’t want to ruin something good for that one little reason,” he says.

But that “one little reason” has stirred a controversy on the post, which has amassed over 30,000 comments and nearly 1,500 shares.

“At first I told myself I could get past it. I said, ‘Let’s just see how it goes,’” the post reads before he goes on to confess, “But it’s been 1.5 years. And I feel horrible, but I just can’t get past it.”

“And I feel like a bad person for being bothered by it. I can’t bring myself to tell her. We’re going to couple’s therapy next week, but I still don’t think I’ll be able to say it. Is there any right way to ask someone to lose weight for you?” it concludes.

The majority of people on Facebook have agreed that there isn’t a right way to ask.

One person wrote on Twitter, “If a man can’t love a woman when she’s overweight, he doesn’t deserve to love her if she ever decides to lose weight on her own.”

“The guy simply has to accept he is not physically attracted to her and move on. Happens to everyone to compromise and realize it doesn’t work,” one person tweeted.

While some comments were more aggressive, with one person saying, “That is a terrible human being,” they all pretty much said the same thing – the man should end the relationship.

But there were at least a couple of defenders, with one tweeting, “How is this shallow? He obviously loves her, and wants her to be attractive. Dont[sic] we all want our partner to be attractive?”

Nearly half of Virginia voters live in a gun-owner household.
A tight race is hardly a surprise, as the Old Dominion State has been a swing state in recent years.
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R).","With the election just a day away, Democrat Ralph Northam holds a five-point edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in the close race to succeed Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Virginia likely voters conducted Thursday through Sunday evenings.

Neither candidate receives majority support, as Northam garners 48 percent to Gillespie's 43 percent. That leaves 1-in-10 voters either undecided (7 percent) or opting for Libertarian Cliff Hyra or another candidate (3 percent) -- which could make a difference come Tuesday.

Northam’s advantage is at the poll’s 2.5 percentage-point margin of sampling error. Last month he had a 7-point lead (49-42 percent, October 15-17, 2017).

Nearly all Northam (94 percent) and Gillespie supporters (91 percent) are certain of their vote choice and both candidates receive strong backing from their party faithful (93 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Republicans respectively).

Independents are a mixed bag, as nearly one-third favors the Democrat, one-third backs the Republican, and another one-third backs the libertarian or is undecided.

Northam is favored by blacks by 79 points (86-7 percent), moderates by 32 (55-23), voters with graduate degrees by 30 (61-31), women by 20 (56-36), and those with a college degree by 18 (54-36).

READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS

The key groups preferring Gillespie include conservatives by 59 points (76-17 percent), white evangelical Christians by 57 (73-16), whites without a college degree by 43 (67-24), and men by 9 (49-40).

Gillespie is also the pick for veterans by 20 points (55-35 percent), despite the fact that Northam is an Army vet.

By far, the economy (24 percent) and health care (24 percent) are the top two concerns for voters. Those prioritizing health care back Northam by 49 points (69-20 percent). Economy voters go for Gillespie by a narrower 25-point spread (58-33 percent).

Meanwhile, voters are more likely to blame Gillespie for how ugly the race has gotten: 50 percent say he has attacked Northam unfairly, while 39 percent say the Democrat made unfair attacks.

Overall, voters rate Northam positively by 16 points (53 percent favorable vs. 37 percent unfavorable) and Gillespie by 10 (51-41 percent).

By a seven-point margin, McAuliffe is also viewed positively (43 percent favorable vs. 36 percent unfavorable), while President Trump is in negative territory by 15 (40-55 percent).

Fully 88 percent of voters who view Trump favorably back Gillespie, while 81 percent of those who have a negative view support Northam.

Interest in the election is a tad bit higher among Democrats, as 48 percent say they are extremely interested compared to 44 percent among Republicans.

Northam is favored by majorities of both those who are extremely interested (52 percent) as well as those who are certain of their vote choice (53 percent).

Conflict between neo-Nazi protesters and counter-protesters on August 12 led to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Confederate monuments and statues were a campaign issue in the wake of that conflict.

A 60 percent majority of Virginia voters agrees with Gillespie that Confederate monuments should remain in place. However, that isn’t the decisive factor for his voters, as just 64 percent of those wanting the monuments to stay up support Gillespie. By comparison, 92 percent of those wanting them to be taken down favor Northam.

Nearly half of Virginia voters live in a gun-owner household. They back Gillespie by 23 points, while Northam has a larger 38-point advantage among non-gun owners.

A tight race is hardly a surprise, as the Old Dominion State has been a swing state in recent years. Even so, Democrats have been on a bit of a roll. Hillary Clinton won Virginia in the 2016 presidential election, and Barack Obama won the state in both 2012 and 2008.

Claudia Varjabedian told The Associated Press that Devin Kelley had been working at Summit Vacation Resort in New Braunfels for the past month and a half and ""seemed like a nice guy."" She said he worked unarmed on his shift as the day security guard and didn't give her any problems.

The riverside resort in the Texas Hill Country is near Kelley's apparent home off a rural highway in New Braunfels, Texas, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) from Sutherland Springs.

Kelley had a history of trouble long before he opened fire Sunday at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people and wounding about 20 others.

He had been discharged from the Air Force for allegedly assaulting his spouse and child, according to an Air Force spokeswoman.

He served 12 months' confinement after a 2012 court-martial. He ultimately received a bad conduct discharge and reduction in rank, the spokeswoman, Ann Stefanek, said Sunday.

She said Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. His job was responsible for moving passengers, cargo and personal property in military transportation.

Kelley previously been charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty in east-central Colorado.

Court records in El Paso County indicate Kelley was cited on Aug. 1, 2014, when he lived in a mobile home park near Colorado Springs. He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence.

The Denver Post reports court records indicate someone was granted a protection order against Kelley on Jan. 15, 2015, also in El Paso County.

A U.S. official told the AP that Kelley doesn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official said investigators are looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 style semi-automatic weapon. The official requested anonymity because the person did not have authorization to speak publicly.

Local records of an August traffic ticket issued in New Braunfels, Texas, for an expired registration and not having auto insurance give a birthdate that would make him 26 years old.

At the address listed for Kelley in New Braunfels, sheriff's deputies were still blocking the gate to his property Monday morning. Several messages left for his relatives went unreturned.

Neighbors said that they heard intense gunfire coming from the direction of the address listed for Kelley in recent days.

""It's really loud. At first I thought someone was blasting,"" said Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road. ""It had to be coming from somewhere pretty close. It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting. It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

A person matching Kelley's name and date of birth also registered in 2014 to vote in Colorado, with an address listed in Colorado Springs, home of the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Colorado Secretary of State's office lists his registration now as inactive.

According to Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin, the gunman arrived at a Valero gas station near the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs at around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He was dressed in black, wearing tactical gear and a ballistic vest.

He crossed the street to the church, left his vehicle and started firing a Ruger AR assault-type rifle at the church. Then he entered the church and fired.

As he left the church, the shooter met an unidentified area resident with his own rifle who pursued him. The suspect was found dead in his vehicle near the border between Wilson and Guadalupe counties. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said investigators believe he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.

I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.

How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.

An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.

Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.

Here’s what to do next.

Establish two-factor authentication

If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.

The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.

Who allows 2FA?

Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.

Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.

But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:

· Bank of America

· Capital One

· Discover

· USAA

· Wells Fargo

If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.

Prevent identity theft

OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?

Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.

How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.

Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.

The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

Liberal network CNN ran a ridiculous headline, “Trump feeds fish, winds up pouring entire box of food into Koi pond,” complete with a misleading tweet from reporter Veronica Rocha that only shows the Trump dumping the entire box of food. Her footage is conveniently edited to skip Abe doing the same thing.

IN fact, Abe dumped his entire box of fish food into the pond and Trump followed while the Prime Minister of Japan smiled. However, the anti-Trump media has been cropping the video to only show Trump’s actions.

Bloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink tweeted that Trump and Abe were “spooning fish food into the pond” when Trump “decided to just dump the whole box in for the fish.” The problem with the attempt to paint Trump as an animal-abusing, lazy America is that Japan's Prime Minister did the exact same thing seconds before.

BuzzFeed News ran a story headlined, “This photo of Trump dumping his carp food in a pond in japan has become a huge meme,” and embedded a series of Japanese tweets mocking the president. The Guardian even ran a story about the dangers of overfeeding fish.

“White House reporters, keen perhaps to pick up on a Trump gaffe, captured the moment when he upended his box on their smartphones and tweeted evidence of his questionable grasp of fish keeping,” The Guardian wrote. “Some speculated that a poor palace employee would be dispatched to the scene to clean up the mess as soon as the two leaders disappeared inside.”

Foreign dignitaries have been feeding the fish in the koi pond for years, but Trump did not lose patience, despite what the media wants the narrative to be. He was literally emulating Abe with his actions.

One Twitter user wrote, “Abe is basically watching in polite rage-horror as the epic orange buffoon tries to kill his fish,” but she clearly didn’t see the entire video, while the New York Daily News said, “The former New York City real estate tycoon got a little heavy handed while feeding koi.”

The government has been based in Saudi Arabia since the Houthis overran the capital Sanaa in 2014.","The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen closed off the land, sea and air ports to the Arab world’s poorest country early Monday after a rebel-fired ballistic missile targeted Riyadh, blaming the launch on Iran and warning it could be “considered as an act of war.”

The coalition’s statement ramps up tensions between the ultraconservative Sunni kingdom and its Shiite rival Iran, both of which have interests in Yemen’s yearslong conflict. The bloodshed continued Sunday as an Islamic State-claimed militant attack in Aden killed at least 17 people.

In a statement, the coalition accused Iran of supplying Yemen’s Houthi rebels and their allies with the missile launched Saturday toward the Saudi capital’s international airport.

Iran has backed the rebels, but denies arming them. The Houthi militants have said their Volcano-variant ballistic missile is locally produced.

The Saudi-led coalition’s statement said the closures would be temporary and “take into account” the work of humanitarian and aid organizations. The war has claimed more than 10,000 lives and driven the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine.

The Saudi-led coalition launched a wave of airstrikes — starting overnight and continuing until noon Sunday — on the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, apparently in response to the ballistic missile. Saudi Arabia said it shot down the missile, with fragments landing in an uninhabited area north of the capital.

The coalition threatened Iran with a possible retaliatory strike.

“Iran’s role and its direct command of its Houthi proxy in this matter constitutes a clear act of aggression that targets neighboring countries, and threatens peace and security in the region and globally,” the statement said. “Therefore, the coalition’s command considers this a blatant act of military aggression by the Iranian regime, and could rise to be considered as an act of war against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”

The statement added: “The coalition command also affirms that the kingdom reserves its right to respond to Iran in the appropriate time and manner.”

There was no immediate response from Iran, though Iran’s defense minister, Gen. Amir Hatami, earlier denied his country was involved in the launch.

“Does anyone ask the United States what are you giving to Saudi Arabia?” he was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency as saying Sunday. The U.S. has offered logistical and targeting support to the Saudi-led coalition.

President Donald Trump also was quick to blame Iran on Sunday. “A shot was just taken by Iran, in my opinion, at Saudi Arabia. And our system knocked it down,” Trump said, referring to the Patriot missile batteries Saudi Arabia purchased from the U.S.

Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard chief, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, said Iran can’t transfer rockets to Yemen and stressed that the missiles were made there. He described Trump’s comments as “lies.”

The Houthis said in a statement that the missile was launched in response to bombings that have killed civilians. The Houthis have fired a number of missiles across the border in recent years, but this appeared to be the deepest strike yet within Saudi territory.

Meanwhile in Aden, masked militants claimed by an Islamic State affiliate set off a large car bomb outside a security headquarters in Yemen’s southern port city early Sunday, killing at least 17 people before storming the compound, officials said. Fighting continued well into the night.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, the security officials said the militants placed snipers on the roof and gunned down most of the security forces inside. The officials gave conflicting accounts of what happened next inside the building. They initially said that the militants had taken an unknown number of people hostage. Later they said that they opened cell gates and released prisoners.

Security forces backed by an Apache helicopter continued to fight for control of the installation after nightfall, chasing down militants in the surrounding structures and neighborhood. Some hostages were killed, they added, without providing specific figures. They said at least five soldiers were among the dead.

Witnesses said at least four militant snipers could be seen on the roof of the compound. They also described mayhem as dead bodies littering the compound’s front courtyard couldn’t be retrieved because of the continuous sniper fire. Shallal al-Shayae, the security chief, was not inside the compound at the time of the attack, the officials said.

In an online statement, the local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack saying they killed 50 soldiers and identified the bomber as Abu Othman al-Hadrami.

Trump’s arrival at the Narita International Airport on Thursday evening was covered by four television stations and treated as “major news,” according to the New York Times. The same went for her subsequent dinner plans at a swanky Tokyo restaurant.

The city’s metropolitan police, too, have assigned Trump an all-female “riot squad” to protect her from overzealous admirers during the visit — and it’s the same security measure they plan to extend to first lady Melania Trump when she and President Donald Trump arrive in Japan on Nov. 5.

VICTORIA BECKHAM IS ONE DESIGNER NOT OPPOSED TO DRESSING MELANIA TRUMP

“Many people think she’s like a princess,” said Lully Miura, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, in a statement to the Washington Post. “She’s well educated, beautiful, sophisticated and rich. And it’s very surprising to Japanese women that she can also talk about things that are important to society.”

The DailyMail added that Japan views Ivanka as ""a fashion icon"" who will attract onlookers during her stay.

On Friday, Ivanka spoke at the World Assembly for Women Conference at Tokyo’s Prince Hotel, which reportedly held a lottery for attendees.

The event was not as well attended as one might expect considering her popularity — Trump delivered an 18-minute speech to a partially-empty auditorium — but White House spokesman Josh Raffel said the hotel’s strict security measures kept people from getting to their seats. (A Washington Post reporter in attendance denies this was the case.) Nevertheless, the women who heard Trump’s speech seemed to view her as a role model.

“She is a beautiful female leader,” Rena Hayakawa, a 21-year-old college student, told the Times. “Her fashion is great.”

Another woman and former U.S. Senate staffer Mieko Nakabayashi, told the site that Ivanka’s “kind of celebrity” resonates with the Japanese people.

However, it’s unclear if Ivanka’s father is looked at as favorably. In a January article in the Independent, titled “Why Japan loves Ivanka Trump,” an Ivanka-admiring blogger — who reportedly writes about the first daughter’s fashion and lifestyle for the Japan Times — hinted that not everybody is as enamored of Donald.

The teenager, whose name has not been released, was a student at the Kaifukan School in Habikino City, Japan. According to local media, the school has a policy that all students must have black hair to attend.

GRANDMA OUTRAGED AT SCHOOL CALLING 11-YEAR-OLD'S DRESS 'DISTRACTING'

Unfortunately, the 18-year-old had naturally brown hair. The suit says that the student’s mom reached out to the school before her enrollment, informing them of her daughter’s lighter hair color. Though she ensured her daughter’s hair color was natural – some schools in Japan force lighter-haired students to prove their hair color by carrying photos of them as children – the school still forced her to dye her hair black to conform to the rules.

Now the teen is saying that the hair dye, which they forced her to do as often as every four days, left burns and rashes to her scalp.

“The dyeing damaged the health of the scalp and hair,” the plaintiff claims. “[Natural] physical features were negated and mental anguish resulted.”

The family is suing the Osaka Prefectural Government for 2.2 million yen (about $19,300) in damages she incurred from the hair dyeing and abuse.

This comes after they tried to file a complaint with the school once the incidents occurred. The complaint was dismissed and the student did not return to school beginning September 2016.

Masahiko Takahashi, the head of the school, declined to comment on the open case, but he did confirm that the school has strict rules about hair and dress code. He also said the school has a ban on bleached or lightened hair, but would not confirm if dyeing the hair black is allowed.

The Asahi Shimbun newspaper writes that the schools force the students to have dark hair to “protect” them from being berated by school officials, since light hair is seen as abnormal in Japan.","Student sues government after school forced her to dye her hair black, she claims",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/11/01/student-sues-government-after-school-forced-her-to-dye-her-hair-black-claims.html

Once the shooting started Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, there was probably ""no way"" for congregants to escape, Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. said.

The gunman, dressed in black tactical gear, fired an assault rifle as he walked down the center aisle during worship services. He turned around and continued shooting on his way out of the building, Tackitt said.

The gunman also carried a handgun, but authorities he did not know if it was fired. Tackitt described the scene as ""terrible.""

""It's unbelievable to see children, men and women, laying there. Defenseless people,"" he said.

The dead ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. About 20 other people were wounded.

The gunman's former in-laws attended services at the church ""from time to time"" but were not there Sunday, Tackitt told CNN on Monday.

The suspect was identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. Authorities said he lived in New Braunfels, about 35 miles north of the Sutherland Springs church.

A U.S. official told The Associated Press that Kelley did not appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation.

Investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley made in the days before the attack, including one that appeared to show an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon.

Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force for assaulting his spouse and child and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement after a 2012 court-martial. Kelley served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his 2014 discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said.

The attacker pulled into a gas station across from the church, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio, around 11:20 a.m. Sunday. He crossed the street and started firing the rifle at the church, then continued firing after entering the white wood-frame building, said Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Safety.

As he left, the shooter was confronted by an armed resident who ""grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect,"" Martin said. A short time later, the suspect was found dead in his vehicle at the county line. Authorities believe he shot himself following a car wreck.

Twenty-three of the dead were found in the church, two were found outside and one died after being taken to a hospital, Martin said.

The man who confronted Kelley had help from another local resident, Johnnie Langendorff, who told KSAT-TV that he was driving past the church as the shooting happened. He didn't identify the armed resident but said the man exchanged gunfire with the gunman, then asked to get in Langendorff's truck and the pair followed as the gunman drove away.

Langendorff said the gunman eventually lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He said the other man walked up to the vehicle with his gun drawn and the suspect did not move. He stayed there for at least five minutes, until police arrived.

""I was strictly just acting on what's the right thing to do,"" Langendorff said.

Among those killed was the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy. Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, were both out of town when the attack occurred, Sherri Pomeroy wrote in a text message.

""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" she wrote. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation.""

Church member Nick Uhlig, 34, who was not at Sunday's service, told the AP that his cousin, who was eight months' pregnant, and her in-laws were among those killed. He later told the Houston Chronicle that three of his cousin's children also were slain.

President Donald Trump, who was in Japan, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" later calling the gunman ""a very deranged individual.""

On Sunday evening, two sheriff's vans were parked outside the gate of a cattle fence surrounding the address listed for Kelley on the rural outskirts of New Braunfels, north of San Antonio.

Ryan Albers, 16, who lives across the road, said he heard intensifying gunfire coming from that direction in recent days.

""It was definitely not just a shotgun or someone hunting,"" Albers said.

The church has posted videos of its Sunday services on a YouTube channel, raising the possibility that the shooting was captured on video.

In a video of its Oct. 8 service, a congregant who spoke and read Scripture pointed to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting a week earlier as evidence of the ""wicked nature"" of man. That shooting left 58 dead and more than 500 injured.

Gov. Greg Abbott called Sunday's attack the worst mass shooting in Texas history. It came on the eighth anniversary of a shooting at Fort Hood, where 13 people were killed and 31 others wounded by a former Army major.

The previous deadliest mass shooting in Texas had been a 1991 attack in Killeen, when a mentally disturbed man crashed his pickup truck through a restaurant window at lunchtime and started shooting people, killing 23 and injuring more than 20 others.

The University of Texas was the site of one of the most infamous mass shootings in American history, when Marine sniper Charles Whitman climbed the Austin campus' clock tower in 1966 and began firing on stunned people below, killing 13 and wounding nearly three dozen others. He had killed his wife and mother before heading to the tower. One victim died a week later, and medical examiners eventually attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.

FOX NEWS - Rand Paul was recovering Sunday from five broken ribs, including three displaced fractures, after he was assaulted by a neighbor who tackled him from behind at the senator’s Kentucky home, officials said.

There are 14 different forms of Batten disease that resemble other progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s. In March 2017, Joseph was diagnosed with CLN7.

Onset of symptoms for CLN7 typically begin between ages 2 and 7, with patients experiencing seizures, developmental regression, muscle twitches, difficulty coordinating movements, speech impairment and loss of mental functioning and motor skills. Patients typically do not survive pass their teen years.

“Without a doubt, whenever we realized what we were up against the decision was instantaneous and getting here, and getting here quickly was first and foremost,” Matt Hann, Joseph’s dad, told Fox 4 News.

Joseph has already suffered severe vision loss, and can only see about six inches in front of him. Despite the setbacks, his dad said rather than ask questions, Joseph adapts to his new way of doing things.

Cohen Chastain heard that a Polk County police officer, Detective Kristen Hearne, 29, was killed while responding to a call about a stolen vehicle.

In an endearing gesture, the 3-year-old showed up at her funeral procession in cop superhero uniform and saluted every officer that passed by him, WSB-TV reported.

“Cohen has always looked up to police officers. He is so sweet and has always had the biggest heart,” said Cohen’s mother, Mandy Brooks Chastain. “He loves superheroes and thinks of police officers as real life superheroes.”

And while it’s tough to get a 3-year-old to sit still for five minutes, little Cohen was so moved by the event that he stood at attention, on a stool, for two hours.

“He made us so proud,” his mother said.

Cohen’s mother wasn’t the only one impressed by Cohen’s actions. The Floyd County Sherriff’s Office, where Hearne started her career, noticed little Cohen’s adorable salute and wanted to reward him for his dedication.

On Tuesday, the officers presented the 3-year-old with an electric toy police car, complete with flashing red and blue lights and a personalized “Deputy Cohen” sticker on the front. They also gave the family a framed photo of Cohen saluting at the procession.

Cohen excitedly drove his new toy and recited the pledge of allegiance, rousing applause and “good jobs!” from the officers.

“We wanted to bless Cohen for his selfless act of support and love,” The Floyd County Sherriff’s office wrote in a Facebook post. “But, once again, we were blessed by him beyond measure. God bless you abundantly and keep you safe Cohen!”

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?","Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.

Taking care of your car or truck’s transmission is important for its long-term health. But all too often, car owners misunderstand the basic maintenance that’s needed to keep a gearbox running smoothly. Consumer Reports’ chief mechanic, John Ibbotson, explains what you need to know.

Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The simple answer is “yes.” But service intervals for new vehicles can exceed 100,000 miles before this needs to be done.

That makes this seemingly clear-cut advice something of a conundrum for car owners. Those who don’t hold on to a new vehicle for very long may never have to have the transmission fluid changed.

On the other hand, factoring in that service is good advice for any owner who plans to keep a vehicle for an extended period of time—or for someone who has bought a used car with high mileage.

The time and cost involved vary from car to car. According to Repair Pal, a CR partner, getting this work done on a 2010 Camry in Rochester, N.Y., should cost $163 to $242.

Whatever the price might be, it’s necessary work. Getting the fluid replaced is certainly going to cost you less than replacing a transmission that’s been left in the lurch by skimping on service requirements. Failing to properly maintain your car’s transmission could leave you stranded and with a big repair bill.

Simple online tools can be invaluable when it comes to knowing whether your car or truck has been subject to any recalls. Other than regular service, your transmission might be due for some important repairs—or have an extended warranty—because of a past recall. (Go to the CR Car Recall Tracker.)

How Often Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The best advice is to know your car and the manufacturer’s recommended service intervals.

It’s worth noting that intervals for changing transmission fluid vary widely. For some cars and trucks, it can range from as little as 30,000 miles to more than 100,000 miles. Some new vehicles, especially those fitted with automatic gearboxes, have transmissions that are almost sealed shut, with fluid that’s meant to last the lifetime of the car.

Remember that unlike engine oil, transmission fluid should never burn off. And a tell-tale sign of a transmission leak will be a puddle of red liquid on the ground, usually underneath the middle or front of the car.

Should I Have My Mechanic Flush My Transmission Fluid?

First, it’s helpful to understand the role transmission fluid plays in a car’s operation. Transmission fluid helps keep mechanical components cool and lubricated, whether it’s an automatic or manual gearbox. Over time, the transmission’s interior components wear down and tiny particles contaminate the fluid. This could potentially lead to damage.

Getting rid of this dirty fluid makes sense, right? If it’s called for in the service manual, go ahead and let your mechanic do the job.

“This shouldn’t be a frequent occurrence, since a gearbox in good working order would not have metal shavings polluting the fluid over a short period of time,"" Ibbotson says. ""If that’s the case, it’s likely a sign of a bigger and more complicated problem.”

“There is also a distinction between simply draining and refilling a transmission versus power-flushing the system,” he adds. “In a high-mileage car, power-flushing the transmission fluid can dislodge sludge and other particles, leading to clogs even after the clean fluid has been added.”

Again, the best advice is to research your vehicle and know exactly when a transmission drain (or flush) is recommended. Doing either option too often is a waste of time and money.

Does My Manual Transmission Need Fluid, Too?

Yes, even a manual needs transmission fluid. The type of fluid can vary from car to car, however. Some manuals require conventional engine oil and others function best with automatic transmission fluid. So make sure you’re putting in the fluid that’s specified for your car. Failing to do so can rapidly affect its performance and the gearbox’s longevity.

Car owners with a continuously variable transmission (CVTs) will also want to pay special attention to the needs of their vehicle. Unlike a traditional automatic that has a set number of gears, a CVT often relies on a belt or pulley system to operate an infinite number of gear ratios. Make sure you use a CVT-specific fluid or you’ll risk big headaches (and repair bills) down the road.

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?

Checking transmission fluid isn’t always easy. In many cases, it’s necessary to have a mechanic put your car on a lift for examination. Some cars do have a transmission dipstick or reservoir in the engine bay, so check under the hood first.

Even though fluid levels might look fine, it could be harder to discern whether there are pollutants or small metal particles in the fluid. “If your car is in for routine maintenance, ask your mechanic to check the transmission fluid,” Ibbotson says.

Separating transmission maintenance from breakdowns is trickier. In a malfunctioning automatic, gearshifts might become more abrupt and occur at awkward intervals. For a car with a manual gearbox, the feel and action of the gear lever could become stiffer and more balky in regular daily operation. These types of problems probably indicate an issue with the gearbox itself. If you experience any of them, let your mechanic know right away.

Is Changing the Transmission Fluid an Easy DIY Job?

It can be a complicated and messy task for the average car owner. “Accessing the transmission requires ramps, jackstands, or a lift,” Ibbotson says. “Even then, getting to the fill plug can require a higher degree of patience and dexterity than what’s required for a typical change of engine oil.”

Many modern cars—the ones with fluid guaranteed for the life of the vehicle—have transmissions that are basically sealed tight, making them all but impossible to work on for the average DIY’er.

East Providence police said Friday the girl was trick-or-treating on Halloween night when her parents discovered the pills.

The girl’s father took the four pills to the department Wednesday and filed a report.

Adderall is the brand name of a prescription medication that treats deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Those who were not prescribed the medication and ingest it may experience nervousness and headaches.

Another former staffer who worked for Webster told Fox News he also heard the publicist brag about “trading” meet-and-greets and backstage passes for oral sex, as late as Parton’s “most recent touring season.” Parton’s ""Pure and Simple"" tour ran from June 3, 2016 to December 10, 2016.

A third employee echoed the others’ statements and said Webster often spoke of using Parton’s name for sexual favors from fans.

Parton cut ties with Webster’s firm this week, and her face disappeared from the front page of the company website on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if she had acquired a new publicist.

“Heaven truly gained a real beautiful angel this morning along with many more,” he said. “I lost a lot of friends and family this morning, but that just means Jesus needed them more.”

""I lost a lot of friends and family this morning, but that just means Jesus needed them more.""

Since the shooting, Scott Pomeroy has also posted on Facebook numerous Bible verses and words of encouragement.

Bryan Holcombe

As the church service continued Sunday morning, Bryan Holcombe, an associate pastor, was walking up to the podium to lead the congregation in worship when the shooting began, according to The Washington Post. His parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said he was killed in the gunfire.

Several of his family members, including his wife, also were killed in the attack, the parents said.

Bryan Holcombe, who was filling in for the pastor, also did prison ministry and would often bring his ukulele to sing for the inmates, his cousin Nick Uhlig told the Associated Press.

“We knew when he was born, that he was going to be a preacher,” Joe Holcombe, his father, told The Washington Post. “His first word was God.”

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family – especially as so many of the family were killed. The family does have immediate access to the funds, the GoFundMe page states.

“This is too much to bear on their own, let's be the Church!” the page said.

Karla Holcombe

Karla Holcombe, Bryan Holcombe’s wife of more than two decades, was also killed in the attack.

A mother and grandmother, Karla Holcombe was described by friends as a generous and loving person. Like her husband, she had also volunteered at prisons and taught Sunday School classes, the Daily Beast reported.

Bryan and Karla Holcombe owned a canvas repair shop in Floresville, Texas, according to the Daily Beast. They also would often post photos of their children and grandchildren on social media.

“They really were loving people,” friend Jenna Brown told the Daily Beast. “They were about as close to a true life of Christ as you could get.”

The Holcombe's daughter, Sarah Salvin, told the New York Times that she is comforted in knowing her parents' faith.

""I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn't scared,"" she said.

Crystal Holcombe

Crystal Holcombe was killed Sunday in church. She was eight months pregnant, according to the Associated Press.

Before loved ones started to post on her Facebook page, frantically searching to see if she survived the massacre, Crystal Holcombe posted about her two daughters, Megan and Emily, who had done well in their 4-H Club’s food challenge. She also posted earlier this month news that her grandfather had passed away.

The Washington Post reported that she homeschooled her children.

John Holcombe, Crystal’s husband, shared on Facebook Sunday morning that the Sunday School lesson this week was from Exodus on manna from heaven. Typically, that lesson is about God providing for people’s needs.

Facebook users have commented on that public post to express their condolences.

""She doesn't even drink, smoke or nothing,"" her cousin, Nick Uhlig, told the Associated Press. ""She just takes care of kids; she raises goats and makes homemade cheese. That kind of thing, you know? They don't go out dancing or anything like that. They're real old-fashioned, down-to-earth.""

Joann Ward, along with some of her children, were killed in the attack, according to the Dallas Morning News.

During the attack, Ward was “shielding [her] babies from the shooter,” Vonda Greek Smith, a friend of Ward’s, said on Facebook.

Two of her children, Emily and Brooke, were reportedly killed in the shooting. Other children, Ryland and Rihanna, were injured in the attack. Smith posted on Facebook that Ward pushed Rihanna, 9, to the ground and prevented her from being shot.

By Jason Whitlock, For The Wall Street Journal



The critics of National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell are only getting louder. Last week Papa John’s Pizza CEO John Schnatter assailed Mr. Goodell for bungling the national anthem protests. “The NFL has hurt us by not resolving the current debacle to the players’ and owners’ satisfaction,” said Mr. Schnatter, whose company is a high-profile sponsor. “Leadership starts at the top, and this is poor leadership. . . . This should’ve been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago.”

Meanwhile, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, is trying to block an extension of Mr. Goodell’s contract. The commissioner’s current deal expires at the end of the 2018 season. NFL insiders originally expected the deal to be extended this past summer. Mr. Jones, who owns more than 100 Papa John’s franchises in Texas, has reportedly been rallying support among fellow owners to oust Mr. Goodell.

Asked Friday about Mr. Schnatter’s rebuke of the commissioner, Mr. Jones hailed the pizza tycoon as a “great American.” Speaking on a radio show Tuesday, he was even more explicit about Mr. Goodell: “I know a lot of people, a lot of fans, don’t think we make him as accountable as we should,” Mr. Jones said. “But that’s not the case. It’s just timing. When you have to account is when you’re either getting hired or you’re getting extended or you’re getting a raise or are you getting a bonus.”

In other words, the time for action has arrived—and Mr. Goodell has a lot to account for. Concern over head injuries has eroded football’s public support. Mr. Goodell’s handling of player discipline, particularly the 2014 Ray Rice domestic-violence case and the 2015 New England Patriots “Deflategate” scandal, damaged the NFL’s image. Now unending national-anthem protests have frustrated the league’s conservative fans, made it a target for President Trump, and contributed to sliding TV ratings.

It makes sense to blame ineffective leadership. But what if the problem is effective leadership? Football is headed exactly where Mr. Goodell has steered it—to the left. The NFL has long been a combatant in America’s larger culture war. But Mr. Goodell—whose father, Charles, was a liberal antiwar Republican senator in the late 1960s—was always an odd choice to run it.

Remember that the NFL was cultivated into prominence by Pete Rozelle, a pro-war conservative.",Is Roger Goodell Deliberately Pushing the NFL Leftward?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/06/roger-goodell-deliberately-pushing-nfl-leftward

Famed L.A. Dodgers Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully spoke publicly on the issue of the anthem before games and made the decree that he’s officially done watching football. The 89-year-old sportscaster was giving a speech at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in California on Saturday when, according to ESPN, he was asked about the protests.

""During the fall and winter, I watch the NFL on Sunday, and it's not that I'm some great patriot. I was in the Navy for a year, didn't go anywhere, didn't do anything, but I have overwhelming respect and admiration for anyone who puts on a uniform and goes to war. So the only thing that I can do in my little way is to not to preach; I will never watch another NFL game.""

As Sports Illustrated notes, Scully’s remarks come at a relatively safe time for him, as he retired last year after almost seven decades as a broadcaster for the Dodgers. Over the past two seasons of the NFL, players have been kneeling during the National Anthem, despite the NFL guidelines encouraging players to stand and place their hands over their hearts.

The protests began last season when the San Francisco 49ers’ Quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, began kneeling during the anthem in an effort to protest, what he perceived to be, an disproportionate reaction by the police to African American offenders in the United States.

And when Webster, the firm’s CEO, started taking an interest in him, Andersen said he thought it was because of his work ethic.

“Everything was fine for a while,” Andersen told Fox News in an interview Wednesday. But when the then-intern revealed he was transgender, things started to become “uncomfortable” with Webster.

“After I told him I was trans, he told me he was gay,” Andersen told us. “And one day he followed me [into] the bathroom and he was like, ‘Do you want to?’ I was like, ‘What?’ He said, ‘F--k.’ And I was like, ‘No, no.’”

Andersen alleged Webster would speak openly about a number of sexually graphic topics, like owning a 24-carat gold sex toy. He also said Webster often told sexually explicit stories about his employees.

Andersen alleges that Webster once asked him to come into a hot tub, naked. That prompted Andersen to alert the Webster company human resources office — several times.

“[My complaint] didn’t go anywhere,” Andersen said. “To get out of Kirt Webster’s grasp once he brings you in, it's hard to get away from him… He’s a predator.”

Andersen said he told his family about the ongoing harassment. A family member spoke to Fox News who recalled hearing about Webster’s alleged behavior in detail at the time, back when Andersen was 26.

Andersen’s claims came a day after former singer Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

Through his company, Webster denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying he engaged in a consensual relationship with Rick. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

When reached by email about Andersen’s allegation, a rep for Webster said she had no additional information at this time.

Rick and Andersen’s stories are two of “many,” according to five former employees who spoke to Fox News this week. They detailed instances where they say Webster showed them porn, made lewd gestures in the office and mocked clients during staff meetings.

A former employee previously known to Fox News, who wished to remain anonymous, said Webster touched him inappropriately on “multiple occasions” adding there are “so many” stories similar to his.

“There’s no telling how many there are,” he said. “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.” A close friend told Fox News the former employee discussed Webster’s behavior in detail many times with him.

A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions. She also alleged Webster made comments about her vagina in front of clients. Her roommate at the time told Fox News the former employee told her they discussed Webster’s behavior at length, and the roommate met Webster several times and witnessed his “lewd behavior.”

Another female former employee told us Webster was “verbally abusive” and told her he was going to “cut my [clitoris].’”

“He scares you. He makes you think you’ll never work in country music again,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time told Fox News he often urged her to leave Webster after hearing about her then-boss’ behavior.

A fourth former employee told Fox News he was hired after graduating from college, and was asked to bring things to Webster at his home, where he encountered his then-boss watching porn.

“One time he was just sitting in a towel on his couch watching porn. He invited me into his hot tub, and when I told him I didn’t have a swimsuit, he implied I could come in naked.”

A fifth former employee told Fox News working for Webster was “the worst experience"" of his life.

“Everybody in Nashville knows Kirt Webster and knows he's a horrible person,” he said.

Reviews on the site Glassdoor, a platform for people to anonymously share information about companies, mimic the sentiments former Webster employees shared with Fox News.

“[Webster] runs his business using fear, intimidation, and harassment,” one reviewer from October 15 wrote. “I am not exaggerating in my accusation of Webster PR as a hostile work environment where employees are subject to sexual harassment, sudden and inappropriate anger outbursts.”

Representatives for Webster himself, or for the company, did not respond to numerous requests for comment.","Country music's top publicist accused of propositioning intern for sex, showing employees porn",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/02/country-musics-top-publicist-accused-propositioning-intern-for-sex.html

The Catalan crisis is being called a ""nightmare"" and a ""time bomb"" for Belgium's government.

The outlawed independence referendum in Catalonia hasn't just sparked a political crisis in Spain. The flight of the region's ousted president to Brussels is sowing divisions within the Belgian government and looks set to damage ties between the two European Union partners.

Even as Carles Puigdemont and his lawyer were questioned by an investigating judge on Sunday about his extradition, members of Belgium's government, Belgian politicians and Spanish officials were trading barbs in the mainstream and social media.

Most vocal are members of the Flemish nationalist N-VA party — a key member of Belgium's ruling coalition and whose separatist desires appear to have been inflamed by Puigdemont's most recent drive for Catalan independence from Spain.

""I am just questioning how an EU member state can go this far,"" Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Jambon told the VTM network Sunday, in reference to the jailing of several of Puigdemont's associates in Spain last week.

Puigdemont maintains that his arrival in Brussels is about raising the profile of Catalan nationhood at European level, and not to interfere in Belgian politics, or ""Belgianize"" politics in Catalonia. But his stay is being dubbed ""the Belgian government's nightmare"" in the media.

""The dossier is a time bomb for the federal coalition,"" wrote the daily Le Soir.

Very little criticism of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has been voiced by Spain's 27 EU partner countries, but Belgium did condemn the violence, much of it blamed on police heavy-handedness, that marked the Oct. 1 referendum in Catalonia.

Around 900 people were hurt — nearly all of them minor injuries. Spain's government defended the police response, saying it was proportionate to the resistance officers met on the streets.

""You have Spanish law but also international law, the European Human Rights Treaty and such things and they come ahead of member state law,"" Jambon said. ""I think the international community must keep a close watch.""

On Twitter, a close Rajoy ally and member of the European Parliament, Esteban Gonzalez Pons, wrote that ""a year ago, Jambon who is defending Puigdemont, was justifying collaboration with the Nazis.""

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has tried to stay above the fray, refusing so far to comment on the case of Puigdemont and four of his associates in Belgium.

Still, that hasn't stopped Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders from weighing in.

""There has been excitement around this dossier that exceeds the limits of what is reasonable,"" he told broadcaster RTL. ""Some people are getting involved in Belgium and commenting on the crisis when it's not their role.""

""The first thing to do is keep the dialogue open with Spain,"" Reynders added.

Easier said than done when Belgian politicians are using politically-charged language to compare Rajoy's center-right government in Madrid and the Spanish judiciary to the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco half a century ago.

""You know where the past of the Popular Party is, and ever more its present — and it is Franco, it is repression, it is jailing people because of their opinion, it is the use of violence against its citizens,"" N-VA leader Bart De Wever told the VRT network Monday.

De Wever isn't a member of Michel's center-right government but he speaks for a party that is central to four-party coalition.

Yet even the moderate Socialist opposition in the French-speaking part of Belgium is using similar language.

""Puigdemont has abused his position, but Rajoy is acting like an authoritarian Francoist. Let's find the path to a more federal Spain,"" tweeted Elio Di Rupo, a former prime minister and Socialist leader in Belgium's southern Wallonia region.

Things are only likely to heat up as campaigning for the Dec. 21 regional election in Catalonia gets underway, and Puigdemont starts stumping for re-election from Belgium. Brussels prosecutors confirmed Monday that his provisional release terms allow him to campaign here and talk to the media.

If Puigdemont's lawyer exhausts all avenues of appeal, the ousted leader could be in town until January.

In a column published Monday on the London-based Guardian's website, Puigdemont said the detention of his colleagues in Spain is ""a colossal outrage"" and he vowed to fight for separatist rights.

He said he wants to draw the attention of other EU countries to the crackdown and ""demand a political rather than judicial solution to the problem.""

The specter that Spain's arrest warrant might even be refused is also very real, as a legal precedent exists that raised tensions between Belgium and Spain in the past.

In October 2013, a court in Ghent rejected a Spanish European arrest warrant to extradite a female member of the armed Basque separatist group ETA.

Maria Natividad Jauregui Espina is accused of shooting dead a senior Spanish army officer in 1981. The warrant was refused over serious concerns that her fundamental rights could have been abused by the move.

The 58-year old woman continues to live and work in Belgium. Her lawyer was Paul Bekaert, the man now representing Carles Puigdemont.

ARIZ. AIRPORT FORCED TO REMOVE SEATING OVER BEDBUG INFESTATION

According to The Miami Herald, officials are currently investigating Saturday’s incident, which reportedly took place near a security checkpoint behind an American Airlines ticket counter. In footage the Herald obtained from an anonymous source, the man can be seen walking behind the ticketing desk and diving onto the conveyor belt.

Subsequent footage shows the unidentified man sprinting across the tarmac as airport workers gave chase. He was quickly apprehended by airport staff, and later handcuffed by a police officer who arrived on the scene.

It is currently unknown whether the man was carrying a weapon, but the Herald’s source finds the incident “very concerning” either way.

“Had there been a plane at that gate, this individual could have entered the plane or had access to the aircraft. This is a very restricted area, only accessible to some with very limited access, and he was able to gain access,” said the source.

PASSENGERS HELD AT AIRPORT BECAUSE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS WERE LATE TO WORK

In a statement obtained by Fox News, American Airlines has commended the ""quick actions of our colleagues in Miami who helped alleviate this security issue,"" though they directed any further inquiries to the Miami police.

Miami-Dade Police have yet to confirm the man’s identity, or whether he was a passenger or employee.

The ad shows a Confederate-flag-flying pickup truck with a bumper sticker for Northam's opponent, Republican Ed Gillespie, chasing down and cornering several Hispanic and Muslim children in a dark alley. The ad sparked outrage as Gillespie and others condemned it for falsely portraying his supporters as violent racists, ahead of Tuesday’s gubernatorial election.

A group called Latino Victory Fund created the ad but pulled it after a terrorist reportedly shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" murdered eight people in New York City using a pickup truck.

Northam distanced his campaign from the ad, telling WAVY-TV, ""That commercial did not come from our campaign. It certainly is not a commercial that I would have wanted to run.""

But disclosure forms suggest the Northam campaign may have been involved, as the Northam campaign reported a $62,729.60 ""in-kind"" contribution in the form of ""media"" from the Latino Victory Fund shortly after the ad came out. Under Virginia law, a media contribution is ""in-kind"" only if the campaign worked with the outside group on the ad.

Phil Kerpen, president of free-market think tank American Commitment, first discovered the disclosure.

""Northam claimed to know nothing about the ad -- on the very same day his own campaign filed an official disclosure accepting the ad as an in-kind contribution,"" Kerpen said.

He points to Virginia law, which says a campaign must have direct involvement in a project for it to be an ""in-kind"" contribution:

""...the candidate or an agent of the candidate's campaign committee must have either expressly requested or suggested... that the expenditure be made,"" a Virginia government guidebook describing the law reads, ""or... have material involvement in devising the strategy, content, means of dissemination, or timing of the expenditure.""

But Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel told Fox News that, despite the disclosure, the campaign had nothing to do with the ad.

""The Northam campaign did not authorize the ad nor did it see the ad before it was released,"" she said in a statement, adding that, ""Ralph Northam would not have run this ad and believes Virginians deserve civility, not escalation.""

About the disclosure documents, she said it was only reported that way because the campaign worked with Latino Victory Fund in other ways: ""In Virginia, groups must report in-kinds for activities like canvassing and data-sharing. Because there are no independent expenditures, and Latino Victory Fund has been sharing data with us, they had to report any activity involving the election as an in-kind.""

But Kerpen noted that it was the Northam campaign, not Latino Victory Fund, that labelled the ad as an in-kind contribution -- a fact that can be confirmed on the Virginia Department of Elections website -- and said the group's other activities like canvassing have nothing to do with how the ad would be treated in disclosure forms.

Yheskel did not respond to a follow-up question about the fact that the disclosure came from Northam's campaign.

Kerpen also challenged Yheskel's explanation of the law, saying, ""If Northam had not coordinated on the expenditure, they would have filed nothing related to it"" -- since it would not have been an ""in-kind"" contribution under the law.

Could the Northam campaign have simply made the disclosure by mistake, thinking they had to do so because they worked with the group in other ways?

""No chance they filed by mistake -- they would have said so and corrected immediately,"" Kerpen said, decrying the ad as “race-baiting.”

Latino Victory Fund did not respond to questions about any coordination with the Northam campaign.

If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process.","When was the last time you hailed a cab? Visited your banker? Found a date at a bar? Searched the shelves of a bookstore?

Almost every part of our lives has migrated online in some way. From getting a ride, to banking, to dating, to buying books, there are few activities still conducted entirely offline. That is, unless we’re talking about voting.

Voting in the United States, and almost every other country for that matter, is primarily done offline – in person and at a polling place, or sometimes by sending mail through the U.S. Postal Service. Any wonder that voter turnout in our presidential election last year was only 55 percent – the lowest rate since 1996?

In an era when many things can be done via a smartphone, it’s time we found a way to let us vote from the comfort of our homes, while we commute to work, or while we stand in line for lunch.

The answer may lie in a small Baltic nation with a population smaller than Hawaii.

Estonia has already been utilizing online voting for a decade. In that country’s last election, nearly one-third of Estonian citizens took advantage of this convenience and cast their ballots online.

The obvious question that arises about online voting is whether it is safe from tampering. If our country adopted this system, could some hacker or group of hackers override the wishes of American voters and change the outcome of the election for president and for other offices?

Estonia has taken steps to combat this legitimate concern. In the e-voting process there, voters use their government-issued ID and can cast their ballot as many times as they like, with only the last vote actually getting counted.

Furthermore, the process involves a cross-device verification method, meaning that a hacker or virus would need to access both the voter’s computer and mobile phone. Voters are also able to connect their phones to the electoral servers and verify how their vote was recorded.

These and other security measures have ensured that online elections remain fair and that voters remain anonymous in Estonia.

While you might think that online votes in Estonia come mostly from millennials who represent the youngest voters in the country, data from the e-voting system proved that nearly half of voters are 45 and over.

In our digital age, it’s not just the young, digital-natives who crave convenience – we have all grown accustomed to moving away from static, unengaging experiences that cut into our leisure time. When we want something, we want it to reach us wherever we are, not vice versa.

Plus, it’s not just convenience we crave. Participation in online polls shows that we genuinely love voting online. Storytelling platform Playbuzz, which provides interactive authoring tools like polls to publishers, reports that over 75 percent of outlets’ stories published in June via the platform incorporated a poll. Playbuzz also notes that polls are one of the most popular tools used by editorial teams worldwide.

Simply scroll through ESPN and you’ll find polls on the MLB All Star game, LeBron’s future, the NHL playoffs, and more. The same is true of VH1, Sky News, Time, and dozens of other online outlets.

Granted, interacting online with editorial content is more casual than voting, but this does show us that when a publisher offers us the opportunity to interact and share our opinion, we jump at the chance. Interacting online is the new normal in our society. So why should voting in elections for government officials be any different?

Not to mention, secure online voting means eliminating several problems that accompany in-person voting, such as limited hours at polling places, long lines and missing part of a workday.

Different generations have different habits of engagement. If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process. If we apply Estonia’s logic and process of online polls to elections worldwide, we could ensure a high voter turnout rate and make democracy more easily accessible.

Forcing all groups to conform to an outdated process simply no longer aligns with society’s daily habits. When governments invest resources in secure, virtual elections, more people will vote and results will better represent the majority of the population.",We can use our smartphones to elect our leaders – here’s how,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/can-use-our-smartphones-to-elect-our-leaders-here-s-how.html

The newspaper then shared the records with ICIJ and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries.
Big investments in two U.S. tech companies from a Russian government bank and Russian energy giant also have come to light.
In the case of Ross, the ICIJ reported Navigator’s Russian customer, Sibur, has ties to Putin in addition to his son-in-law.","The Commerce Department on Sunday pushed back on published reports that Secretary Wilbur Ross has a stake in a company connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he did not previously disclose to lawmakers.

According to records obtained by the International Consortium of Journalists, Ross is an investor in Navigator Holdings, a shipping giant whose customers include Russian gas and petrochemical producer Sibur.

Putin’s son-in-law Kirill Shamalov once owned more than 20 percent of the company, but now holds a much smaller stake.

A Commerce spokesman told Fox News on Sunday that Ross was not involved with Navigator’s decision to engage in business with Sibur, a publicly traded company, which was not under sanction at the time and is not currently.

The spokesman also said Ross, the Trump administration’s point man on trade and manufacturing policy, “never met” Shamalov, and generally has supported the Trump administration’s sanctions against Russia, while recusing himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels.

Still, the published reports by news agencies including NBC and the BBC likely will raise more questions about whether those associated with Trump are connected to Russia, amid special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether both sides colluded to influence the 2016 White House race.

Yet it wasn’t immediately clear how many partners Ross might have or what the profit-sharing agreement might be. The reports also indicated there was no sign Ross broke any disclosure rules.

ICIJ disclosed the Ross holding as part of reporting on 13.4 million records of offshore entities in tax havens leaked to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

The newspaper then shared the records with ICIJ and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries. The New York Times is its U.S. partner in this inquiry. The Times earlier reported on the Ross holding.

“In concealing his interest in these shipping companies — and his ongoing financial relationship with Russian oligarchs — Secretary Ross misled me, the Senate Commerce Committee, and the American people. Secretary Ross’ financial disclosures are like a Russian nesting doll, with blatant conflicts of interest carefully hidden within seemingly innocuous holding companies,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., in a statement to Fox News. “The Commerce Department’s Inspector General must open an inquiry immediately. Only after a thorough investigation can the American people be sure that Secretary Ross really has their best interests at heart — and that he hasn’t prioritized his own personal profits or those of Vladimir Putin or his Russian business partners.”

It wasn’t immediately clear exactly how much of Navigator, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Ross personally owns. ICIJ reported that Ross and other investors own four Cayman Island entities that in turn own 31.5 percent of Navigator, a stake worth $176 million at Friday’s closing stock price.

Ross’ stake in Navigator is likely a small fraction of that. In financial disclosure forms he filed with the government this year, Ross valued his holdings in the Cayman Island entities, which include other companies besides Navigator, at no more than $10.1 million.

Sibur contributed 8 percent to Navigator’s revenue last year, according to reports filed with securities regulators. Russia’s energy sector is largely controlled by individuals with ties to state actors, including Putin.

Much of the new trove of files includes bank statements, emails and loan agreements from Appleby, a law firm that helps set up offshore dummy companies and trusts. Appleby told the ICIJ that there is “no evidence” that it has done anything wrong.

Other records came from Asiaciti Trust, a family-run offshore specialist based in Singapore, and from 19 corporate registries maintained by governments in jurisdictions that draw the wealthy seeking privacy.

Big investments in two U.S. tech companies from a Russian government bank and Russian energy giant also have come to light.

The ICIJ reported that Silicon Valley investor and Russian citizen Yuri Milner got $191 million from VTB Bank, and invested that money in Twitter. The leaked records also show that a financial subsidiary of Russian energy company Gazprom funded a shell company that invested in a Milner-affiliated company that held roughly $1 billion in Facebook shares shortly before its 2012 initial public offering.

Milner told the ICIJ that he was unaware of any involvement by the Gazprom subsidiary in any of his deals and that none of his investments has been related to politics.

Milner also has invested in a tech-savvy real estate fund that was co-founded by Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner called Cadre. Milner told the ICIJ that he used his own money for the investment.

Sunday’s revelations follow last year’s release of records from a Panama-based firm involved in setting up offshore accounts. That disclosure triggered investigations in several countries, the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and ouster of the leader of Pakistan. The Panama Papers also revealed that close associates of Russia’s leader Putin had been using the dummy accounts abroad to store their wealth, including a close Putin friend who had $2 billion of offshore assets.

There are legitimate reasons for setting up offshore accounts, but lax regulation and anonymity in some jurisdictions make it easy to launder money, evade taxes and avoid regulatory scrutiny. Critics of the widening gap between the super-wealthy and the rest have seized upon the use of tax havens as revealed in the Panama Papers as evidence of a crisis, and governments have promised to crack down.

In the case of Ross, the ICIJ reported Navigator’s Russian customer, Sibur, has ties to Putin in addition to his son-in-law.

A big shareholder is Gennady Timchenko, who was targeted by the U.S. and other western nations for sanctions after Russia’s invasion of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014. A few months later, the U.S. barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to another large Sibur shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson. Mikhelson has also been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for propping up Putin’s rule.

Sibur itself was not targeted by the U.S. sanctions, but the Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland reportedly backed away from doing business with the company.

The Russian gas producer last year contributed $23 million to Navigator’s revenue, an increase of more than 40 percent in two years.

Johnnie Langendorff told Fox San Antonio he decided to track down the killer after seeing the gunman, Devin Kelley, exchanging fire with another member of the community. That person, who hasn't been identified, reportedly shot Kelley during the encounter.

The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded.

Langendorff said he arrived at an intersection near the church. He said he witnessed Kelley and the other man engaged in a gun battle and recognized one of the men from the community.

""I pulled up on the intersection and I saw the shooter coming from the cars, actually right outside the church his vehicle was parked, doors open, engines open and him and the neighbor across the street and exchanging fire,"" he said.

""The shooter got in his truck, the gentlemen with the rifle came to my truck as the shooter took off, and he briefed me quickly on what had just happened and said we had to get him, so that's what I did,"" he said.

Following a brief chase, the two caught up with the gunman.

""We just take pursuit, we speed over 87 through traffic and hit about 95 going down 539 trying to catch this guy until he eventually lost control on his own and went off in the ditch,"" Langendorff said.

Hannah Summers, an 18-year-old nursing student who just started her first year of college, had lost her mother Peggy to kidney cancer on Oct. 31, Huffington Post reports. But just a short while later, Hannah discovered that her mother, who was only 55 when she passed, had previously written a touching letter of encouragement and advice for each of her children, to be opened in the event of her death.

“Mom wrote us all letters before her surgery, thinking things could go wrong,” wrote Hannah in a Facebook post she shared on Wednesday. “Although she made it through her surgery, she passed 4 months later.”

At first, Hannah didn’t want to share her mother’s personal message online, but she eventually changed her mind. “The more I read it, the more I feel like I want to,” she said.

In the letter, Peggy Summers tells her daughter not to be angry, but instead to lean on her loved ones for support. She also shared advice about jobs, driving and boys.

""If you are reading this then the surgery did not go well,"" Peggy wrote. “I’m sorry, I tried my best to beat this terrible disease, but God had other things for me to do.”

“Please don’t be mad,” she continued. “Bad things happen in life and we have to learn to deal with it no matter how much it hurts.”

Peggy went on to advise Hannah about keeping an emergency kit in her car, and staying away from wild parties. But she also told her daughter how proud she was to be her mom, and told her she would be just as “wonderful” a nurse as she is a human being.

“I am thankful God gave us this past year to get closer and spend a lot of quality time together,” Peggy wrote. “Hang on to those good memories and tell everyone you love them as often as you can. Enjoy life and live each day as if it is your last because none of us know if today will be the last.”

But it wasn’t just Hannah who took Peggy’s words to heart — her letter soon went viral on social media, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and more than 1,000 comments.

Flanagan called Keitany ""the alpha racer"" and said she was ready to ""suffer dearly"" while keeping up with the unpredictable runner.

On the podium, Flanagan put her hands over face and began to cry again when she was announced the winner. She turned to hug Keitany before accepting her medal.

Flanagan had said she may retire if she won New York. She didn't immediately make an announcement regarding her future.

Kamworor ran the race in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 53 seconds. He and Kipsang embraced just past the finish line to huge cheers.

The race on Sunday took place just days after a truck attack in Lower Manhattan killed eight people, and took place under the watchful eye of an extremely heavy police presence.

In Brooklyn, where runners made their way down a long stretch, roads were blocked and officers lined the street. As the runners went by, they were accompanied by an escort of police vehicles.

Those cheering the runners on say the increased security presence was noted, but didn't dim the experience.

Karen Hester has been coming to watch the race for 10 years and told the Associated PRess she was ""not in the slightest"" bit concerned about being in a crowded space or the threat of a terror attack.

Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

Brazile’s self-serving effort to expose the Democratic Party’s skeletons is a step toward recovery.
Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives.
And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.
The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party.","Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is in search of absolution. In a cloyingly self-pitying article for Politico Magazine excerpted from her upcoming book, she reveals the extent to which the DNC willingly surrendered control of the organization to Hillary Clinton’s campaign well before Clinton became the party’s presidential nominee.

In the article, Brazile scolds her predecessors at the DNC and scolds President Obama and his allies for allowing the party’s fundraising apparatuses to atrophy. But most of all, she attacks Hillary Clinton.

Brazile alleges that the joint fundraising agreement the DNC signed with the Clinton campaign in August was “unethical,” a claim disputed by DNC Chairman Tom Perez. And she confesses to being disturbed by her inability to confirm that the DNC was not trying to “throw the primary” to Clinton.

Finally, Brazile reveals that she knew all along that the polls couldn’t be trusted, even if the Democratic Party’s elected representatives and pollsters had no idea. “I found a lack of enthusiasm for her (Clinton) everywhere,” she confessed to Bernie Sanders alone.

Brazile could endure the shame of secretly relaying Democratic primary debate questions to Hillary Clinton when the Clintons were the powers that be. But those days are over. Now it’s Bernie Sanders’ party, and Brazile is surely hoping her offering to the new overlords will be satisfactory.

It’s not necessary to buy every detail of Brazile’s account to see the writing on the wall. When asked about Brazile’s confessional and whether that meant that the primary was rigged against Sanders, progressive darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., replied flatly, “yes.”

This is no country for a Clinton.

Brazile’s self-serving effort to expose the Democratic Party’s skeletons is a step toward recovery. It demonstrates that the party’s efforts to avoid conducting an “autopsy” on its failed effort in the 2016 election can only be suppressed for so long.

Democratic lawmakers and party insiders have gone to great lengths to ensure that any postmortem on the 2016 race is kept under wraps. But rather than controlling the direction in which the party’s post-2016 debate will flow, the Democratic Party has inadvertently let activists and pollsters perform the dissections on the party’s 2016 corpse.

A study conducted by the Democratic political research firm Global Strategy Group, for example, found that the Democratic Party’s base voters actually did turn out to vote. But the problem for Democrats was that many of them turned out to vote for Donald Trump.

“Those Obama-Trump voters, in fact, effectively accounted for more than two-thirds of the reason Clinton lost,” the report said.

Another study conducted by the super PAC Priorities USA learned that voters in swing states, including many Democrats, thought the Democratic Party was more likely than the GOP to favor the wealthy, and voted accordingly.

It’s all rather confusing and often conflicting. Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives. In a comprehensive New York Times Magazine piece, Robert Draper examines a party at war with itself – not over policy, but over tone and tactics.

For example, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel helped engineer a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 by hunting for conservative Democratic prospects to run in conservative districts.

“When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at,” Emmanuel confessed. “‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

Emmanuel is still getting yelled at. Progressive Change Campaign Committee founder Stephanie Taylor attacked Emanuel’s “50-state strategy” for, of all things, only being able to maintain control of the House for four years. Had the party run true-blue progressives in those red districts, she said, the Democrats might have enjoyed more “lasting success.”

The impulse to impose ideologically progressive homogeneity on the Democratic Party is evident in how the progressive activist base responded to Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie’s foray into immigration-related issues.

Gillespie’s decision to make the matters of the MS-13 gang and sanctuary cities an issue in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign has offended the sensibilities of his Democratic opponents. They claim, correctly, that MS-13’s presence in Virginia is, while not negligible, numerically modest. They add that there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia.

To even raise this issue is to inflame cultural tensions toward no higher purpose than dividing the electorate against itself and stoking racial anxieties. But it wasn’t until the Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, confirmed that he would sign an anti-sanctuary city bill if one crossed his desk that the progressive left truly revealed its capacity for inchoate rage.

“Northam caves to opponent’s racist ads on sanctuary cities,” the progressive blog Think Progress barked.

Ezra Levin, one half of a team of activists lauded in Politico as responsible for crafting the “playbook for stonewalling the Trump presidency,” attacked his favored candidate, writing that “parroting Gillespie’s hateful xenophobia is despicable.”

The Nation’s Washington editor, George Zornick, mourned the Northam campaign’s validation of “Gillespie’s racist narrative.”

The activist organization Democracy for America went a step further and dubbed the Northam campaign itself a “racist” organization.

This isn’t political analysis; it’s a primal scream. Moreover, it has blinded progressives to the fact that local candidates know best how to appeal to their constituents.

A Monmouth University survey released Oct. 17 found Gillespie’s message on crime and immigration resonating with voters. Gillespie’s image on crime had improved markedly over the course of one month, coinciding with a decline in overall support for Northam.

“This is a game of inches right now, so any small advantage counts,"" said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray.

Northam’s struggles are indicative of a broader problem with a party that has outsourced agenda-setting to the activist base. Longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg recently warned his party that the Democratic brand is “weakening” and the opportunities the party could enjoy in 2018 will be forfeited if Democrats do not develop a concise agenda.

Greenberg advised Democrats to hammer away on the GOP’s failure to preserve access to health insurance, preserve entitlement programs, or protect the little guy from abuse. Greenberg’s firm found that the message that tests best with voters is a familiar one: “Trickle-down has failed and the richest need to pay their fair share of taxes.”

The dirty secret is that the Democratic Party’s activist base is not animated by messages like these. The activists get out of bed in the morning ready to do cultural battle with pro-Trump forces, not over economic issues but cultural concerns. And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.

Say what you will about the GOP’s 2012 “autopsy,” at least the Republican Party engaged in an open display of introspection in the wake of a humiliating defeat. The autopsy galvanized a Republican activist base resentful of what it saw as the false elite consensus around diversity and immigration, and vowed to show the party leaders why they were wrong.

Perhaps mindful that Donald Trump’s nomination represented a repudiation of that Republican autopsy’s recommendations, Democrats have opted to pass on the public self-flagellation. In the process, though, they’ve only hastened the same reckoning that Republicans endured.

The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party. They do not share their representatives’ enthusiasm for road-worn talking points about Reaganomics. They see the rise of Trump as an urgent threat, but their representatives do not appear to share their burning apprehension.

Democrats didn’t make anything better by performing the autopsy on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 prospects behind closed doors. Now, instead of controlling events, events are in control of them.",Hillary Clinton's loss in the election sparks civil war between Democrats,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/hillary-clintons-loss-in-election-sparks-civil-war-between-democrats.html

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces.
In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.
The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.
Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.","Officially retired, Army Capt. Gary “Mike” Rose was never in Laos at the height of the Vietnam War.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The small Swedish automaker’s Agera RS supercar has claimed the title of World’s Fastest Production Car at 277.9 mph. And it’s even faster than that.

The record was set Saturday on a closed 11-mile stretch of Nevada State Road 160 outside Las Vegas. The 1,341 hp car made two runs on the dead-straight highway, one in each direction, and its speeds were averaged as required for Guinness-recognized world record.

That includes the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which has held the official record of 267.8 mph since 2013.

Official certification of the record is forthcoming, but in-car video evidence of the run was released by Racelogic, the company that provided the data logging equipment for the attempt.

The roughly $2 million Agera RS is powered by a 5.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that delivers power to the rear wheels. And it's not just fast, but it can accelerate, too. The car also set a new mark for the 0-400-0 run at 33.87 seconds, breaking its own record of 36.44 seconds achieved just a month ago.

Attempts to break the top speed record should be coming soon.

Bugatti has a new 1,600 hp car called the Chiron that’s more powerful than the Veyron Super Sport, and its own private test track in Germany to play on.

What are we to think when the sacred things of society are disregarded and become the site of evil? Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.
This laid the groundwork for the king's son to claim the mantle of crown prince.","Saudi Arabia has arrested dozens of princes, senior military officers, businessmen and top officials, including a well-known royal billionaire with extensive holdings in Western companies, as part of a sweeping anti-corruption probe that further cements control in the hands of its young crown prince.

A high-level employee at Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Co. told The Associated Press that the royal— who is one of the world's richest men— was among those detained overnight Saturday. The company's stock was down nearly 9 percent in trading Sunday on the Saudi stock exchange.

The surprise arrests, which also reportedly include two of the late King Abdullah's sons, were hailed by pro-government media outlets as the greatest sign yet that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is keeping his promise to reform the country, long been plagued by allegations of corruption at the highest levels of government.

Analysts have suggested the arrest of once-untouchable members of the royal family is the latest sign that the 32-year-old crown prince is moving to quash potential rivals or critics. The prince's swift rise to power has unnerved more experienced, elder members of the ruling Al Saud family, which has long ruled by consensus, though ultimate decision-making remains with the monarch.

The king named his son, the crown prince, as head of an anti-corruption committee established late Saturday, just hours before its arrest of top officials.

A Saudi government official with close ties to security says 11 princes and 38 others are being held in five-star hotels across the capital, Riyadh. The official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

The scale of the arrests is unprecedented in Saudi Arabia, where senior royals and their business associates were seen as operating above the law. Saudi nationals have long complained of rampant corruption in government and of public funds being squandered or misused by people in power.

Shortly before the arrests, King Salman had ousted Prince Miteb bin Abdullah from his post as head of the National Guard. The prince is reportedly among those detained in the sweep, as is his brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who was once governor of Riyadh. Both are sons of the late King Abdullah, who ruled before his half brother King Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne.

Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, such as: Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, the former finance minister; and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

An earlier crackdown on perceived critics of the crown prince included clerics, writers, lesser-known princes and Saudi figures popular on social media.

""The dismissals and detentions suggest that Prince Mohammed rather than forging alliances is extending his iron grip to the ruling family, the military, and the national guard to counter what appears to be more widespread opposition within the family as well as the military to his reforms and the Yemen war,"" James M. Dorsey, a Gulf specialist and senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said an analysis of the shake-up.

Saudi Arabia said late Saturday it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen at Riyadh International Airport, on the outskirts of the capital. The crown prince, as defense minister, oversees the stalemated war against Yemen's Iranian-allied rebels.

The Finance Ministry said the anti-corruption probe ""opens a new era of transparency and accountability,"" enhances confidence in the rule of law and improves the kingdom's investment climate.

Reports suggested those detained were being held in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, which only days earlier hosted a major investment conference.

Marriott International said in a statement that it is currently evaluating the situation at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh. ""As a matter of guest privacy, we do not discuss the guests or groups with whom we do business or may be visitors of the hotel,"" the statement added.

It is not clear what Prince Alwaleed or others are being investigated for.

The Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel said the anti-corruption probe was looking into the response to flooding in Jiddah that killed around 120 people in 2009 and devastated the city again in 2011, as well as the government's handling of a Coronavirus outbreak that has killed several hundred people in recent years.

Prince Alwaleed's many investments include Twitter, Apple, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains. He is also an investor in ride-sharing services Lyft and Careem.

The prince, often pictured on his 85.65-meter (281 foot) superyacht in the Mediterranean, is among the most outspoken Saudi royals and a longtime advocate for women's rights. He is also majority owner of the popular Rotana Group of Arabic channels.

The AP reached out overnight to Kingdom Holding for comment. There was no response as of Sunday afternoon. The senior employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of repercussions, said security bodies informed him of the arrest.

The kingdom's top council of clerics issued a statement saying it is an Islamic duty to fight corruption— essentially giving religious backing to the high-level arrests being reported. A top royal court official, Badr al-Asaker, on Sunday appeared to confirm the arrests on Twitter, describing a ""historic and black night against the corrupt.""

The government said the anti-corruption committee has the right to issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions and freeze bank accounts. It can also trace funds, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and take other precautionary measures until cases are referred to the judiciary.

Meanwhile, Prince Miteb was replaced by a lesser known royal, Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin, to head the National Guard— a prestigious force tasked with protecting the royal family, important holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and oil and gas sites.

Just three months earlier, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was plucked from the line of succession and from his post as interior minister, overseeing internal security.

The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

So why do people with disabilities run with guides?
The Achilles athletes in wheelchairs or handcarts don’t need guides; they would be too fast for guides, anyway.
What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?
It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles.","The Babylonian Talmud teaches: “Because you have greeted one who cannot see, you merit to be greeted by the One who cannot be seen.” Inspiring words that would be reason enough for me to serve as a guide runner for a blind athlete in Sunday’s New York City Marathon. But there are other reasons as well.

Sunday will be the sixth time in the last eight years that I’ve run the marathon in New York as a guide runner for runners with disabilities, always under the auspices of Achilles International. The mission of the organization is “to enable people with all types of disabilities to participate in mainstream running events in order to promote personal achievement.”

Achilles is the brainchild of Dick Traum, a wheelchair-bound athlete who competed in New York back when the marathon was a series of loops around Central Park. He wondered: What if there were facilities and a training program to aid athletes with disabilities from around the globe in their quest to run marathons?

Well, now all that exists.

Sunday morning, hundreds of athletes with every conceivable disability, from Manhattan to Mongolia, along with their able-bodied guides, will gather at the Achilles tent in the shadow of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.

The athletes include veterans who have lost limbs in battle, individuals born with disabilities, and others who have overcome the unimaginable to make it to the starting line in New York.

The athletes I guided in past years were: a deaf man from California; a South African survivor of a car accident that left him with a stroke and brain damage; a woman from New Jersey with scoliosis (a condition that causes curvature of the spine); a woman from North Carolina with severe GI tract issues; and a French cancer survivor in his early 70s.

The woman with scoliosis had the best line. “My doctor said I could only run two miles a day,” she told me. “I decided I’d do two weeks worth of running today.”

My wildest moment (so far): In 2010, the night before the race, I went into a drugstore and ran into the Chilean miner who had trained for New York by running laps while trapped underground for 69 days. I’d seen him the night before on Letterman.

Turned out he knew little about the “lore” of marathoning – Vaseline to avoid chafing; carrying snacks on the course; and insoles because his running shoes didn’t quite fit.

So we talked, through his interpreter, and shopped for half an hour.

We came out of the store and a crowd had gathered – he was something of a celebrity back then. He pointed back to me, as everybody was trying to get selfies and autographs, and shouted, “I love you, boy!”

My hardest experience as a guide came with my French runner. My fellow guide and I literally linked arms with him and walked him the length of the course. This was in 2014, when crosswinds on the Verrazano and on Manhattan side streets reached over 50 mph. I’ve never been so cold, but our guy made it.

So why do people with disabilities run with guides? New Yorkers (and their guests) are an aggressive lot, and it never hurts to have someone to keep you from getting jostled on the course. Also, in case of injury or inability to finish, the guide provides company and reassurance until help arrives.

The Achilles athletes in wheelchairs or handcarts don’t need guides; they would be too fast for guides, anyway.

Last year, a father pushed his son in a wheelchair the length of the race. Now that’s athleticism.

What’s it like to guide a disabled person for Achilles International in the New York City Marathon?

The closest comparison I can offer is the scenes in the film “A Hard Day’s Night,” where the London cops escorted the Beatles as they rushed past their fans from limo to hotel.

New Yorkers recognize the yellow Achilles T-shirts, and they go bonkers for the runners with disabilities.

The spectators may not know exactly what disability a given runner possesses, but they certainly understand – and applaud – the intense courage it takes for a person with disabilities to go 26.2 miles.

This year my blind runner comes from New Zealand, and a scrum of guides will surround him. One in front to clear the path, two on either side, and one in back. Projected finish time: 7 hours, 30 minutes.

But what’s the rush?

It’s not hard to understand why hundreds of able-bodied athletes will run this Sunday as guides for Achilles. Where else can you get the runner’s high and the helper’s high – all at the same time – and then get a medal as a reward for your efforts?

Where else can you help make someone’s impossible dream come true, with 2 million people cheering you on?

As Achilles International says on its website: “While our programs focus on running, the truth is, running is simply the tool for accomplishing our main objective: to bring hope, inspiration, and the joys of achievement to all.”

About 1,900 years ago, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote, “God divided man into men that they might help one another.”

Whether you prefer Epictetus or the Talmud, it sure seems like running as a guide for a runner with a disability is the right thing to do.",Why I am running the New York City Marathon as a guide for a disabled runner,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/04/why-am-running-new-york-city-marathon-as-guide-for-disabled-runner.html

Participation in online polls shows that we genuinely love voting online.
If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process.","When was the last time you hailed a cab? Visited your banker? Found a date at a bar? Searched the shelves of a bookstore?

Almost every part of our lives has migrated online in some way. From getting a ride, to banking, to dating, to buying books, there are few activities still conducted entirely offline. That is, unless we’re talking about voting.

Voting in the United States, and almost every other country for that matter, is primarily done offline – in person and at a polling place, or sometimes by sending mail through the U.S. Postal Service. Any wonder that voter turnout in our presidential election last year was only 55 percent – the lowest rate since 1996?

In an era when many things can be done via a smartphone, it’s time we found a way to let us vote from the comfort of our homes, while we commute to work, or while we stand in line for lunch.

The answer may lie in a small Baltic nation with a population smaller than Hawaii.

Estonia has already been utilizing online voting for a decade. In that country’s last election, nearly one-third of Estonian citizens took advantage of this convenience and cast their ballots online.

The obvious question that arises about online voting is whether it is safe from tampering. If our country adopted this system, could some hacker or group of hackers override the wishes of American voters and change the outcome of the election for president and for other offices?

Estonia has taken steps to combat this legitimate concern. In the e-voting process there, voters use their government-issued ID and can cast their ballot as many times as they like, with only the last vote actually getting counted.

Furthermore, the process involves a cross-device verification method, meaning that a hacker or virus would need to access both the voter’s computer and mobile phone. Voters are also able to connect their phones to the electoral servers and verify how their vote was recorded.

These and other security measures have ensured that online elections remain fair and that voters remain anonymous in Estonia.

While you might think that online votes in Estonia come mostly from millennials who represent the youngest voters in the country, data from the e-voting system proved that nearly half of voters are 45 and over.

In our digital age, it’s not just the young, digital-natives who crave convenience – we have all grown accustomed to moving away from static, unengaging experiences that cut into our leisure time. When we want something, we want it to reach us wherever we are, not vice versa.

Plus, it’s not just convenience we crave. Participation in online polls shows that we genuinely love voting online. Storytelling platform Playbuzz, which provides interactive authoring tools like polls to publishers, reports that over 75 percent of outlets’ stories published in June via the platform incorporated a poll. Playbuzz also notes that polls are one of the most popular tools used by editorial teams worldwide.

Simply scroll through ESPN and you’ll find polls on the MLB All Star game, LeBron’s future, the NHL playoffs, and more. The same is true of VH1, Sky News, Time, and dozens of other online outlets.

Granted, interacting online with editorial content is more casual than voting, but this does show us that when a publisher offers us the opportunity to interact and share our opinion, we jump at the chance. Interacting online is the new normal in our society. So why should voting in elections for government officials be any different?

Not to mention, secure online voting means eliminating several problems that accompany in-person voting, such as limited hours at polling places, long lines and missing part of a workday.

Different generations have different habits of engagement. If governments want to encourage all of their citizens to vote, then it’s time we modernize the voting process. If we apply Estonia’s logic and process of online polls to elections worldwide, we could ensure a high voter turnout rate and make democracy more easily accessible.

Forcing all groups to conform to an outdated process simply no longer aligns with society’s daily habits. When governments invest resources in secure, virtual elections, more people will vote and results will better represent the majority of the population.",We can use our smartphones to elect our leaders – here’s how,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/can-use-our-smartphones-to-elect-our-leaders-here-s-how.html

The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.
Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history.
Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""
Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

Senior Adviser Doug Stafford said it is unclear when the Republican senator will return to work since he is in “considerable pain” and has difficulty getting around, including flying. Stafford said this type of injury is marked by severe pain that can last for weeks to months.

“This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Stafford said a statement to Fox News.

The Bowling Green Daily News reported that an arrest warrant said Paul told police his neighbor came on his property and tackled him from behind Friday, forcing him to the ground, all while the senator had been mowing his lawn. He had trouble breathing because of the rib injury, the warrant said.

A Warren County official did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for a copy of the arrest warrant.

Police arrested 59-year-old Rene Boucher on Saturday and charged him with misdemeanor fourth-degree assault with a minor injury. Boucher lives next door to Paul and his wife, according to Warren County property records.

Boucher was released from jail Saturday on a $7,500 bond. He has a court date scheduled for Thursday. Boucher did not return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment. It is unclear if he has an attorney.

“Displaced rib fractures can lead to life-threatening injuries such as: hemopneumothorax, pneumothorax, pneumonia, internal bleeding, laceration of internal organs and lung contusions. Senator Paul does have lung contusions currently,” Stafford explained.

Sunday’s disclosures come a day after Paul’s office said the senator was fine and characterized his injuries as minor.

Paul and his wife, Kelley, “appreciate everyone’s thoughts and well wishes and he will be back fighting for liberty in the Senate soon,” Stafford said.

Paul was the lone GOP nay on the budget framework for tax reform, although his position on tax reform itself appears to be on the edge. The Trump administration has suggested that Paul is a yea on tax reform. The GOP only can lose two votes on tax reform before needing Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie.

Paul’s health could be another factor in the White House’s race to finish tax reform ― along with the health of Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and John McCain, R-Ariz.

Boucher is an anesthesiologist and a pain specialist. He invented the “Therm-A-Vest,” a cloth vest partially filled with rice that when heated can be worn to relieve back pain, according to a 2005 article from the Bowling Green Daily News.

A spokeswoman for Paul said he was “blindsided” by the attack, but did not provide more details. Police have not said what motivated the attack. Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges said the FBI is checking to see if the attack was politically motivated.

FBI spokesman David Habich said the agency is aware of the incident and is “working with our state and local partners to determine if there was a violation of federal law.”

The attack was a shock for the community in Bowling Green, where a neighbor says he would often see Paul and Boucher out walking their dogs on the normally quiet streets. Jim Skaggs, a member of the state Republican Party executive committee, lives in the neighborhood and has known both men for years. He said they disagreed politically, but was shocked to hear of the incident.

“They were as far left and right as you can be,” Skaggs said. “We had heard of no friction whatsoever other than they just were difference of political opinion. Both of them walked their little dogs at about a mile and a half circle, a nice little dog trot. I’d see them out walking, maybe they might stop and speak with each other.”

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

“How bloody pompous! It’s a compliment to the chef the fact that customers want to take a pictures of dishes they’ve paid for,” argued Ramsay in a series of Twitter posts that have since gone viral.

GORDON RAMSAY BLASTS JAMIE OLIVER OVER COMMENT ABOUT HIS FAMILY, DEMANDS APOLOGY

The “Hell’s Kitchen” host was responding to reports of a new edict from the people behind the famed Waterside Inn in Berkshire, one of only four restaurants in all of England to boast three Michelin stars. Late last month, the restaurant had put up a sign instructing diners to refrain from taking pictures of their dishes — a practice which deeply irks one of the restaurant’s founders.

“I’m really getting so upset about people taking pictures. We put up a card at the door — ‘No photos, please,’” Michel Roux, who co-founded the Waterside Inn with his brother Albert, told the Daily Mail when the sign went up.

“What are they doing?” he added. “Maybe once during the meal you want to take a little photo of something because it’s unusual. But what about the flavors? A picture on a phone cannot possibly capture the flavors.”

But Ramsay, who owns one of the few other three-starred Michelin restaurants in England, was extremely critical of the Waterside’s decision, arguing that food photography was a form of free advertising. In another tweet, he suggested that Roux, 76, was an “old fart” who refused to keep up with the times.

Ramsay further pointed out that the social media teams at UK’s Michelin Guide post pictures of their dining experiences, calling it “a breath of fresh air.”

GORDON RAMSAY REALLY HATES THESE THREE AMERICAN FOODS

The outspoken chef then continued to respond to Twitter followers who agreed with his sentiments, and ultimately hinted that Roux, whose son now runs the dining room at the Waterside, had forgotten that “customers are king.”

Hundreds of Ramsay’s other followers echoed his feelings about food photography, with many arguing that patron should be able to snap pics the meals they’re paying for. Only a scant few admitted that they, or someone they know, might find the practice annoying.

The Telegraph, meanwhile, has pointed out that the Roux family’s other Michelin-starred restaurant in London — Le Gavroche — isn’t as strict with its photography rules.

Albert Roux’s own son, Michel Roux Jr., serves as the chef at the London hotspot, and once stated that he doesn’t really care if people take photos of his food.

Alwaleed is known to have invested through his fund, Kingdom Holding, in Apple, Lyft, Twitter and other high-profile companies.","One of the world's richest men, who's been the longtime face of Saudi Arabia's outreach to the west, remained locked up in a 5-star hotel Monday, following a weekend shakeup of the Kingdom's royal family.

The reshuffling occurred as Saudi King Salman swore in new officials to replace those arrested in the sweeping anti-corruption probe.

Billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is a nephew of the king and is worth an estimated $18 billion, is reportedly being held up at the country's Ritz Carlton in Riyad, along with 10 other princes and 38 officials. Rumors swirled the royals were receiving five-star accommodations when the luxury hotel was evacuated Saturday, The New York Times reported. An airport for private planes was also closed, possibly to prevent businessmen from fleeing via the airport.

The arrests that began late Saturday included Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who for the past four years had led the National Guard, and Adel Fakeih, who was minister of economy since April. They were reportedly arrested in a purported anti-corruption probe led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne, though he has not been thought of recently as a challenger to Prince Mohammed.

Prince Alwaleed is accused of money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, an official told Reuters on Sunday.

The major purge came hours before Senior Saudi Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir Province, and seven other officials were killed in a helicopter crash near Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen, BBC reported, citing state media. It’s unclear what caused the crash. Prince Mansour, the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, was returning from an inspection tour Sunday night.

Investors were left shaken after Prince Alwaleed’s arrest. The billionaire is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Co., which lost 7.5 percent in trading Sunday. The company made no reference to its chairman's arrest, but on Monday said in a statement it has the government's ""vote of confidence"" as it pursues its investment strategy and global business operations.

As of 2016, Alwaleed held a five-percent stake in 21st Century Fox, Fox News’ parent company. Kingdom Holding does not currently own significant stakes in 21st Century Fox. Alwaleed is known to have invested through his fund, Kingdom Holding, in Apple, Lyft, Twitter and other high-profile companies. Kingdom Holding manages more than $12.5 billion of investments around the world.

CEO Talal al-Maiman said the company is focused on its ""unwavering responsibilities"" to shareholders.

The official Saudi Press Agency released images of the king on Monday swearing in new National Guard chief Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin and new Economy and Planning Minister Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.

The king was also pictured meeting Lebanon's outgoing Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, who unexpectedly resigned during a trip to Saudi Arabia. The photos of their meeting did little to quiet speculation over his surprising move and current status. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hariri's top political rival at home, argued on Sunday that Saudi Arabia had forced Hariri to resign amid the deepening Saudi-Iran rivalry and questioned whether Saudi Arabia had also detained him in the sweep.

The Saudi government has not confirmed those arrested or named those who were detained. A statement by the attorney general's office said no assets of any suspects have yet been frozen. Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, including Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, a former finance minister, and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

A box made from a tree stump on which Abraham Lincoln purportedly gave one of his earliest political speeches was given to the Rochester Historical Preservation Society last week, the (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports.

Lincoln delivered a speech in the town in 1832, when he campaigned for the state House, according to the newspaper.

Terry Campbell of Green City, Missouri, gave the box to the society Friday on behalf of the Campbell family, the State Journal-Register said. The land where Lincoln spoke reportedly has been in the family for more than 130 years.

Campbell inherited the box after his father, Bill Campbell, died several years ago. They’d discussed donating it.

“He told me about the box and that Lincoln had stood on this stump to give his first political speech, and when he got done, members of the family cut the stump down and then built boards out of it to build a box,” Terry Campbell told the newspaper. “There were actually two boxes made out of the stump, both of them alike, and (my dad) had the one.”

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

Barth, 37, told The Wrap she decided to come forward with her accusations after another woman contacted her stating she was also drugged and assaulted by Guillod.

Barth said she went to the Los Angeles Police Department with the allegations for a second time, after attempting to press charges in 2012. Barth said she chose not to press charges after Guillod threatened to sue her.

However, Guillod’s attorney, Thomas M. Ferlauto, told The Wrap the case was dropped due to lack of evidence.

“Witnesses were interviewed whose version of events belied and completely contradicted Ms. Barth’s and LAPD determined the charges to be unfounded. No criminal or civil case was ever brought against Mr. Guillod,” Ferlauto said.

The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment.

Barth said she was not aware of witnesses who may have contradicted her allegations and said her boyfriend at the time and now-husband Danny Cusumano, confirmed her statements.

Last week, Barth wrote in a blog post for The Wrap that she blacked out while having dinner with “Atomic Blonde” producer Guillod.

“The next thing I remember is waking up at home with six hickeys on my neck,” she wrote.

“I was horrified. I was completely and utterly confused and I was sick to my stomach. Through email, he tried to play it off as a silly make-out session between friends. He sent me message after message begging that we talk and letting me know how upset he was and that he couldn’t sleep because of the pit in his stomach,” Barth wrote.

The actress said she dropped Guillod as a manager immediately.

Barth claimed Guillod made sexual advances toward her on previous occasions and only went to the noted dinner because actress Felisha Terrell was going.

Terrell, whose manager is still Guillod, told The Wrap Barth’s recount of the dinner seemed to be inaccurate.

“There were some inaccuracies in the story as I recall it. If I felt these accusations were 100 percent true I would not have remained a client. As a woman in this business, I am both supportive and inspired by women speaking their truth,” Terrell said.

Barth said that after her blog post was published, another woman contacted her and named Guillod as a person who sexually assaulted her.

“She titled the email with his name. I immediately had shivers from head to toe,” Barth told The Wrap. “The woman said that she had a similar experience, which was horrific … She said it was about three years ago.” The woman asked not to be identified.

When cameras stopped rolling and millions of viewers weren’t watching, the former football player was at war with himself. While his character personified “sex, drugs and professional wrestling,” DiBiase was a devoted family man of faith.

DiBiase ended his wrestling career in 1999 after 25 years in the industry.

Today, the 63-year-old married father of three is a full-time evangelist who has been officially ordained into the ministry. He is sharing his story in a new documentary, “The Price of Fame,” which premieres in select theaters November 7.

Fox News spoke with the Million Dollar Man, as well as several WWE Superstars, about DiBiase’s religious journey:

He bullied everybody with his money, and his motto was ""Everybody’s got a price."" The Million Dollar Man thought he could buy anybody or anything and that was the essence of the character. About as evil as you can get!

Fox News: What were some of your memories of the Million Dollar Man?

Christian (Former WWE Superstar): I don’t think that character would have worked with anybody playing it besides Ted DiBiase. I think he just played it to a T, he had the look, the voice, the laugh.

Tommy Dreamer (Former WWE Superstar): I told him [he was] always great. He did everything how you’re supposed to do it. He should have been Mr. Perfect because he did it perfectly.

I’ve talked to a lot of guys that he rode with, they all saw his life and the adultery and everything he was doing on the road and that was the beginning of the downfall of Ted DiBiase or the Million Dollar Man, but it was also the start of the rise and the redemption of who he would become.

Fox News: Who is Ted DiBiase today?

DiBiase: Today I am Ted DiBiase, not the wrestler, but now I am a minister. I travel all over the United States basically in evangelism, speaking in churches, speaking in prisons, speaking in rehab centers wherever I can basically sharing my story of redemption and the turnaround in my life.

That’s why this film was titled “The Price of Fame."" Now I want to be careful with saying the price of fame is whatever you make it. We all make individual decisions, but it’s like a lot of the things that come a long with being famous. You got to build accountability into your life or it’s very easy for it to take you down.

Fox News: What do you hope people will take away from this movie?

Ferriero: I think one of the biggest takeaways I would like for people to have watching the movie is that you can really change your life in a flash. And sometimes forgiveness can not only benefit the person but yourself as well.

DiBiase: The really important things in life, and I found out the hard way because I found all those things at the end of the day to be empty. Because if I don’t have a wife and a family who loves and respects me, if I don’t have their respect and if I’m not living my life in such a way that I’m being open and honest with them than what do I really have.

I’ve been traveling and speaking in churches and all these other places for 17 years now and I’m still going. I tell people all day who say ""When you going to retire?"" I said I never found the word retirement in the bible, so I’m going to keep going till I’m not here.

According to The Miami Herald, officials are currently investigating Saturday’s incident, which reportedly took place near a security checkpoint behind an American Airlines ticket counter. In footage the Herald obtained from an anonymous source, the man can be seen walking behind the ticketing desk and diving onto the conveyor belt.

Subsequent footage shows the unidentified man sprinting across the tarmac as airport workers gave chase. He was quickly apprehended by airport staff, and later handcuffed by a police officer who arrived on the scene.

It is currently unknown whether the man was carrying a weapon, but the Herald’s source finds the incident “very concerning” either way.

“Had there been a plane at that gate, this individual could have entered the plane or had access to the aircraft. This is a very restricted area, only accessible to some with very limited access, and he was able to gain access,” said the source.

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

Wilder, who won the 1990 Virginia gubernatorial race to become the first African-American elected U.S. governor, has a long history of backing fellow Democrats for governor.

He backed Mark Warner in 2001 and Terry McAuliffe in 2013, though he didn’t support fellow Democrat Creigh Deeds' failed 2009 bid.

And throughout his roughly 40 years in elected office, Wilder, considered a moderate Democrat, has been noted for his fiscal and law-and-order conservatism.

In this year’s Virginia governor’s race, Wilder has endorsed neither Republican nominee Ed Gillespie nor Democrat Ralph Northam, instead backing Northam running mate Justin Fairfax.

“We do not have the best candidates. I will start off with that,” Wilder, who several years ago declared himself an independent, said in a recent “1947: The Meet the Press Podcast.”

Though Wilder has endorsed neither gubernatorial candidate, the race has attracted some big-name support and endorsements.

President Trump has backed Gillespie via Twitter, saying he’d be a “great” governor and suggesting Northam would be “VERY weak on crime!”

Former President Barack Obama last month stumped in Virginia for Northam, in a race that in the closing weeks has largely become a referendum on which candidate would keep Virginians safer from criminals, including illegal immigrants.

And Hollywood has even gotten into the act.

“I'm writing from the set of my new movie to ask for your help in this critical governor's race in Virginia,” actor Mark Ruffalo wrote in a recent fundraising/get-out-the-vote letter for MoveOn.org. “The stakes in this year's elections couldn't be higher. I'm asking that you help by taking a few minutes to call progressive Virginia voters … and ask them to vote for Ralph Northam.”

Northam leads Gillespie by 5 percentage points, according to a Fox News poll released Monday.

Virginia was the only southern state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in last year’s White House race.

Wilder argued in the podcast that Fairfax, who also is African-American, has been marginalized in the race, which will hurt the Democratic ticket.

“No Democrat is going to get elected in Virginia without strong African-American support,” he said. “Now that you understand that, what do you do to get that vote? You don’t do it by dissing Justin.”

A grandson of slaves, Wilder grew up in poverty and worked his way to becoming one of Richmond’s most successful trial lawyers. Before becoming governor, Wilder served in the state Senate. He was also the mayor of Richmond.

During his term as governor, Wilder was revered by Republicans for being fiscally responsible. Without raising taxes, he set up a “rainy day” account of $200 million -- a revenue fund that since its inception has stabilized the state through many volatile budgets.

Unlike the last gubernatorial election that largely focused on Virginia’s economy, social issues have emerged this year as deciding factors.

One key issue is whether to remove Confederate statues in Virginia.

During the gubernatorial debates in September, Gillespie said that he would preserve the Confederate statues, while Northam called for the statues to be removed. He said that he would prefer to see the statues in museums.

Wilder suggested in the podcast that Northam should focus on educating the public about the Civil War, especially in schools.

“To the extent of saying we are going to spend money to take our monuments and put them in museums, where is that money going to come from when schools are not getting the teachers that we need?” he asked.

Wilder’s advice to both candidates regarding the statues: Let the people of Virginia decide what they want to do.

“If the people want to take it down, take it down, but have consensus to the degree of participation,” he said. “It shouldn’t be done just by saying ‘I want this done.’ You can’t deal with it by knee-jerk actions.""","In close Virginia governor's race, elder statesman Wilder withholds endorsement",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/06/in-close-virginia-governors-race-elder-statesman-wilder-withholds-endorsement.html

Sometimes it’s the unassuming gesture that makes the most profound impact on your life.

We never set out to build a museum for the Bible. We were happy raising our children and helping to run the family business.

We thought that someone else was going to put the museum together, and we were content to acquire items, then donate them to the museum.

Little did we know that when we agreed to help acquire a biblical artifact, our future had changed.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

We had to ask ourselves, “What would it look like for us to keep the dream alive and work toward building a museum to house all these wonderful ancient biblical artifacts?” That thought was, honestly, overwhelming.

But the deeper question we had to ask and answer for ourselves was, “What does it mean for us to take this journey?”

The answer to that question is the premise for our new book, ""This Dangerous Book."" It’s an answer that unfolds like an archaeological dig, layers upon layers removed until the experience of discovery makes us smile in delight.

We discovered how precious these artifacts are. They are also precious to all kinds of people, all over the world.

So many people of different faith traditions have pulled us aside and expressed their gratitude for this project.

It’s one of the most rewarding aspects of our journey in building a museum.

We’ve found a remarkable sense of unity around this ancient text. That excites and inspires us.

Holding up the Bible as this wonderful human treasure invites people of all walks of life to come and see, explore, and discover this gift of history.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

At the same time, we recognize that today in America, the Bible does not possess the same centrality that it did at our country’s founding.

Journalist and author Kenneth Briggs observes, “For more and more Americans, the Bible has become a museum exhibit, hallowed as a treasure but enigmatic and untouched. Snippets of its languages still pop up occasionally in political speeches. But overall, the Bible is overridden by consumer appetites and a growing array of lifestyles that . . . offer ways of thinking about life, love, and work that have left the Bible behind.”

We believe, however, that this is only partially true of our culture. It may be that we are simply not as skeptical as Mr. Briggs, but our observation is that yes, although our culture does not know the Bible as it once did, there is real longing to know it better.

We can all, as a nation and as collective humanity, observe, appreciate, study, and discuss this book. So much wonder and mystery surrounds not only the Bible itself, as a cultural artifact, but also its claims, its narrative, and its ultimate message.

Our journey with the museum reminds us how God leads us with a journey in mind. We were working for our family business and trying to help some others in their worthy endeavor.

As the collection grew, the family started feeling the responsibility of it. We had been entrusted with the items, and we felt we needed to be sure the dream of a museum became a reality.

The idea was not new to the family; my brother had mentioned more than once over the years the idea of building a Bible museum. He was building a chain of Christian bookstores and carried one of the largest selections of Bibles available.

So little by little, we embraced the dream.

One of the first ideas as a result was opening a traveling exhibit. I (Steve) have said that we, my family, are not collectors. My dad operates by the philosophy that if you buy a new shirt, an old shirt has to go. We were acquiring artifacts not because we were collectors but because we wanted to tell their story.

The problem was, our closet was getting full, and we had no idea when we would be opening a museum. We had no location or date; it was only a dream at the time. That’s when the idea for a traveling exhibit was birthed. We could start telling the incredible story of the items we had acquired, while the idea of the museum developed.

Toward the end of 2010, we had a two-day planning meeting for a Bible exhibit. We wanted to open the exhibit in 2011, launching it with the celebration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the King James Version of the Bible. The King James Version is the most printed version of the Bible, and we thought that would be a great opportunity to launch an exhibit.

In 2011, we successfully opened our U.S. version of a traveling exhibit at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art.

This was the beginning of a journey, a journey with an unknown destination. Not too long after we opened the Oklahoma City exhibit, through some contacts at American Bible Society, discussions began about having an exhibit at the Vatican. We had just finished a race to open the first exhibit, and now the race was on again, as the desired opening for the exhibit at the Vatican was during the lenten season of 2012. We successfully opened the exhibit for the lenten season, which was the first of other international exhibits to come.

Before the museum opened, we had also traveled to Jerusalem, Argentina, Cuba, and Germany. We also traveled to several universities across the U.S., with exhibits of varying sizes.

Over the next five years, the exhibit traveled to five cities total, with its last tour ending in 2016 in Santa Clarita, California. It had grown from a fifteen-thousand-square-foot exhibit in Oklahoma City to a forty-thousand-square-foot exhibit before it was closed.

Back in 2011, none of this had been in sight.

Steve and Jackie provide unique insight and commentary into the Bible’s role in our culture and in their personal life. Since 2009 they have been planning for the presentation of various archaeological finds pertaining to the Bible and the world’s most impressive display of materials relating to the Bible’s original writings, its preservation, and its distribution around the globe.

Through thick and thin and a switch to Chinese ownership, it hasn’t left its wagon-loving fans in the lurch, even as other brands have come and gone from the segment to find comfort in the sales reports for their SUVs.

Its latest is the V90, and it’s Volvo’s largest and most luxurious wagon yet. Based on the sleek S90 sedan, the V90 can be filled with all of the premium trim and semi-autonomous gadgetry offered in the sedan. Really, the only difference between the two is their tail ends.

That is, unless you opt for the V90 Cross Country, the jacked-up and ruggedized V90 that will account for the vast majority of the wagon’s sales. Because it’s sort of an SUV. In fact, if you want the regular V90, you have to custom order it. Dealers are stocking their lots with a steady stream of V90 CCs.

They have all-wheel-drive, and you can get them with a 250 hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder or Volvo’s unique and remarkable 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder, which delivers 316 hp along with a 30 mpg highway fuel economy rating.

The starting price is $53,295, but expect to see many V90 CCs equipped with pricey options like the $4,500 luxury package with its buttery Nappa leather-upholstered massaging seats, and the $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins audio system, which sounds as ridiculously good as its price sounds ridiculous.

The V90 CC does come standard with Volvo’s Pilot Assist, a feature that uses a radar and a camera to self-steer the car in its lane on the highway without rear-ending the vehicle in front. It’s one of the best systems of its kind, and it works well even if the lines on the road aren’t freshly-painted.

Pilot Assist won’t let you take your hands off the wheel for more than about 15 seconds, but you get the impression that it could. The twistiest roads will eventually trip it up, but I didn’t need to make any inputs along a winding 50-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey, except to change lanes and exit.

Pilot Assist isn’t meant for off-road, but the V90 CC very much is. With 8.3 inches of ground clearance, it rides about two inches higher off the ground than the street-smart version of the V90, which puts it well into crossover country and endows it with a pretty capable rough-road ride without ruining its comfort and handling on pavement.

VOLVO S90 W/PILOT ASSIST TEST DRIVE:

Tall sidewall all-season tires and a $1,200 self-leveling rear air suspension get the CC over big bumps and through deep divots without much pain. I wouldn’t suggest chasing Jeeps onto the rocks with it, but an off-road mode locks it in four-wheel-drive and engages hill descent control under 25 mph to help manage reasonably challenging terrain.

An available 360-degree camera is useful when navigating tight trails, but you’ll want to turn off all the parking sensors that go with it if you’re among the trees. They make a lot of beeps. (So many beeps.)

This won’t be an issue for most V90 CC owners, who will likely be using them more on snowy streets than fire roads. Either way, its snazzy, Scandinavian interior is so nice, you’ll want to do your best not to track in any mess. Especially if you opt for the white carpet. Do so at your own risk.

Since the V90 CC shuns the classic boxy Volvo wagon design, its trunk isn’t as voluminous as it could be, but the space back there is deep and features a power cargo cover to go along with its power tailgate — because if you can afford one of these cars, you’ve probably gotten soft.

In fact, if you have enough money for a V90 CC, you could buy the larger, even higher-riding three-row XC90 SUV and end up with change to spare. So why wouldn’t you?

Most cross-shoppers will. The XC90 is one of Volvo’s top sellers. But the V90 CC does have a few practical advantages, including a low roof for loading bikes and antiques, better fuel economy and more car-like handling. And above all, it’s a station wagon. Some Volvo customers wouldn’t drive anything else.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""
Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

“It was never my intention, in my public statements, to ‘blame the victim’ in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently,” he continued.

“I simply posited that the settlement of such cases certainly delayed justice, though I am fully aware that those settlements were entered into w the understanding that settlement is wise, intimidated into believing so.”

He added that his heart goes out to all the victims of sexual assault and that his foundation will continue to post on the topic of its work with the arts and environment.

Baldwin faced backlash over comments regarding settlements that he made during an interview with PBS NewsHour, in which he pointed out that when women settle sexual harassment suits and are silenced in the process through NDAs, “the course of change” is delayed.

“When you talked about Harvey Weinstein in the business, you knew that he was highly intrusive in the process of making films … you knew that he was a very intense guy … and last but not least, you heard the rumor that he raped Rose McGowan. You heard that over and over — we heard that for decades. And nothing was done,” he began.

“Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him,” he continued, after being asked why no one had come forward if they were aware of the alleged incident. “And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”

He referenced a New York Times article and stated that many people had wondered, “Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?”

“When women take money, and are silenced by that money – even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told beyond the money it was the right thing for them to do, keep quiet, don’t make too many waves, it’s going to hurt your career — when they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the course of change? That’s an issue, I think,” he finished.

Asia Argento, who accused Weinstein of raping her in a New Yorker piece following the original New York Times exposé, retweeted the PBS NewHour video, and wrote, “Hey, [Alec Baldwin] you’re either a complete moron or providing cover for your pals and saving your own rep. Maybe all three.”

She followed up with a second tweet: “Alec Baldwin mansplaining ‘the cause’ for women everywhere. That’s a good caption for that video.”

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

But Chinese leaders are spooked. President Trump is the first American president to sanction a Chinese bank for helping North Korea evade U.S. and United Nations economic sanctions.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will no doubt flatter his American guest, hoping that President Trump prefers the image of a successful summit to a confrontation over sanctions. But President Trump should not fall for it.

With North Korea on the brink of being able to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile, President Trump must increase pressure on Pyongyang and its enablers, especially Beijing.

China has responded well to U.S. pressure so far. For example, it issued a banking directive prohibiting financial transactions with North Koreans and another directive prohibiting North Korean businesses in China and joint ventures. But this is not enough.

China accounts for an estimated 90 percent of North Korean trade, giving it significant economic leverage. And according to the U.N., China imported $182 million of North Korean coal in August and September this year, despite its February pledge to stop the practice.

If Beijing cannot implement its own coal restriction, we should not trust that it will act against its own citizens who help North Korea evade economic sanctions. President Trump should tell Xi as much.

While the two leaders should project a cordial relationship in public, President Trump should warn Xi in private that Washington will move forward with robust sanctions targeting Chinese companies and banks that facilitate North Korea’s evasion of sanctions.

Chinese entities that strengthen North Korea’s economy by getting around sanctions undermine the American policy of financially isolating North Korea. That isolation is key to gaining leverage as a means to prevent a military conflict.

Xi knows what’s coming. The Trump administration has already sanctioned Chinese and Russian facilitators of North Korea’s sanctions evasion, and in September sanctioned 26 overseas representatives of North Korean banks.

These actions are a clear warning shot to Beijing that Washington is widely expected to target additional Chinese nationals and banks that play a key role in these illegal schemes.

The Trump administration should take a page from the Iran sanctions playbook and issue fines against Chinese banks for failing to identify North Korean transactions – similar to the $12 billion in fines issued from 2012 to 2015 against European banks for Iran sanctions violations.

President Trump is also visiting Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe solidified his supermajority in recent elections.

Abe declared North Korea as one of Japan’s two national crises. And in a sign that Washington fully backs Abe’s North Korea policy, President Trump will meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. At minimum, the visit will shine a spotlight on Pyongyang’s abhorrent human rights record.

President Trump’s itinerary also includes South Korea. His relationship with President Moon Jae-In has not always been an easy one, because of differences in whether to confront or engage the North Korean regime of dictator Kim Jong Un. However, North Korea’s provocations have drawn the U.S. and South Korea closer.

U.S. military assistance has also strengthened ties with South Korea. Seoul has deployed a U.S.-supplied Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense system to defend against North Korea’s missile program. The North Korean human rights issue offers another area of commonality with Moon, who was a human rights lawyer.

If President Trump plays his cards right, he will discourage South Korea from drawing closer to Beijing. China already agreed to suspend its sanctions against South Korea in exchange for a commitment that Seoul will not deploy additional THAAD launchers, participate in a U.S. regional missile defense, or enter into a trilateral defense alliance with Japan. The China-South Korea détente could erode American leverage with Beijing.

More broadly, President Trump must seize the opportunity on this trip to build a multilateral coalition outside the U.N. of likeminded countries (South Korea, Japan, Australia, Britain, France and Germany) that commits to increasing pressure on North Korea.

This group of nations should focus on identifying additional networks ripe for coordinated sanctions actions. It should also target North Korean shipping by declaring that all vessels linked to North Korea can be inspected under U.N. and international law.

Amidst all of this, President Trump should be prepared for new North Korean missile tests during his time in the region. Kim Jong Un wants to remain in the spotlight.

But no matter what Pyongyang launches, Trump’s message must be consistent: denuclearization is America’s vision for the Korean Peninsula. The United States must not accept anything less, given North Korea’s egregious history of nuclear, chemical and missile proliferation.",Trump should confront China on North Korean nukes during his Asia trip,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/trump-should-confront-china-on-north-korean-nukes-during-his-asia-trip.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives.
And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.
The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party.","Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is in search of absolution. In a cloyingly self-pitying article for Politico Magazine excerpted from her upcoming book, she reveals the extent to which the DNC willingly surrendered control of the organization to Hillary Clinton’s campaign well before Clinton became the party’s presidential nominee.

In the article, Brazile scolds her predecessors at the DNC and scolds President Obama and his allies for allowing the party’s fundraising apparatuses to atrophy. But most of all, she attacks Hillary Clinton.

Brazile alleges that the joint fundraising agreement the DNC signed with the Clinton campaign in August was “unethical,” a claim disputed by DNC Chairman Tom Perez. And she confesses to being disturbed by her inability to confirm that the DNC was not trying to “throw the primary” to Clinton.

Finally, Brazile reveals that she knew all along that the polls couldn’t be trusted, even if the Democratic Party’s elected representatives and pollsters had no idea. “I found a lack of enthusiasm for her (Clinton) everywhere,” she confessed to Bernie Sanders alone.

Brazile could endure the shame of secretly relaying Democratic primary debate questions to Hillary Clinton when the Clintons were the powers that be. But those days are over. Now it’s Bernie Sanders’ party, and Brazile is surely hoping her offering to the new overlords will be satisfactory.

It’s not necessary to buy every detail of Brazile’s account to see the writing on the wall. When asked about Brazile’s confessional and whether that meant that the primary was rigged against Sanders, progressive darling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., replied flatly, “yes.”

This is no country for a Clinton.

Brazile’s self-serving effort to expose the Democratic Party’s skeletons is a step toward recovery. It demonstrates that the party’s efforts to avoid conducting an “autopsy” on its failed effort in the 2016 election can only be suppressed for so long.

Democratic lawmakers and party insiders have gone to great lengths to ensure that any postmortem on the 2016 race is kept under wraps. But rather than controlling the direction in which the party’s post-2016 debate will flow, the Democratic Party has inadvertently let activists and pollsters perform the dissections on the party’s 2016 corpse.

A study conducted by the Democratic political research firm Global Strategy Group, for example, found that the Democratic Party’s base voters actually did turn out to vote. But the problem for Democrats was that many of them turned out to vote for Donald Trump.

“Those Obama-Trump voters, in fact, effectively accounted for more than two-thirds of the reason Clinton lost,” the report said.

Another study conducted by the super PAC Priorities USA learned that voters in swing states, including many Democrats, thought the Democratic Party was more likely than the GOP to favor the wealthy, and voted accordingly.

It’s all rather confusing and often conflicting. Now, nearly a year later, the Democratic Party is awash in competing narratives. In a comprehensive New York Times Magazine piece, Robert Draper examines a party at war with itself – not over policy, but over tone and tactics.

For example, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel helped engineer a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006 by hunting for conservative Democratic prospects to run in conservative districts.

“When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at,” Emmanuel confessed. “‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

Emmanuel is still getting yelled at. Progressive Change Campaign Committee founder Stephanie Taylor attacked Emanuel’s “50-state strategy” for, of all things, only being able to maintain control of the House for four years. Had the party run true-blue progressives in those red districts, she said, the Democrats might have enjoyed more “lasting success.”

The impulse to impose ideologically progressive homogeneity on the Democratic Party is evident in how the progressive activist base responded to Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie’s foray into immigration-related issues.

Gillespie’s decision to make the matters of the MS-13 gang and sanctuary cities an issue in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign has offended the sensibilities of his Democratic opponents. They claim, correctly, that MS-13’s presence in Virginia is, while not negligible, numerically modest. They add that there are no sanctuary cities in Virginia.

To even raise this issue is to inflame cultural tensions toward no higher purpose than dividing the electorate against itself and stoking racial anxieties. But it wasn’t until the Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, confirmed that he would sign an anti-sanctuary city bill if one crossed his desk that the progressive left truly revealed its capacity for inchoate rage.

“Northam caves to opponent’s racist ads on sanctuary cities,” the progressive blog Think Progress barked.

Ezra Levin, one half of a team of activists lauded in Politico as responsible for crafting the “playbook for stonewalling the Trump presidency,” attacked his favored candidate, writing that “parroting Gillespie’s hateful xenophobia is despicable.”

The Nation’s Washington editor, George Zornick, mourned the Northam campaign’s validation of “Gillespie’s racist narrative.”

The activist organization Democracy for America went a step further and dubbed the Northam campaign itself a “racist” organization.

This isn’t political analysis; it’s a primal scream. Moreover, it has blinded progressives to the fact that local candidates know best how to appeal to their constituents.

A Monmouth University survey released Oct. 17 found Gillespie’s message on crime and immigration resonating with voters. Gillespie’s image on crime had improved markedly over the course of one month, coinciding with a decline in overall support for Northam.

“This is a game of inches right now, so any small advantage counts,"" said Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray.

Northam’s struggles are indicative of a broader problem with a party that has outsourced agenda-setting to the activist base. Longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg recently warned his party that the Democratic brand is “weakening” and the opportunities the party could enjoy in 2018 will be forfeited if Democrats do not develop a concise agenda.

Greenberg advised Democrats to hammer away on the GOP’s failure to preserve access to health insurance, preserve entitlement programs, or protect the little guy from abuse. Greenberg’s firm found that the message that tests best with voters is a familiar one: “Trickle-down has failed and the richest need to pay their fair share of taxes.”

The dirty secret is that the Democratic Party’s activist base is not animated by messages like these. The activists get out of bed in the morning ready to do cultural battle with pro-Trump forces, not over economic issues but cultural concerns. And they, not Stanley Greenberg, are writing the Democratic Party’s talking points.

Say what you will about the GOP’s 2012 “autopsy,” at least the Republican Party engaged in an open display of introspection in the wake of a humiliating defeat. The autopsy galvanized a Republican activist base resentful of what it saw as the false elite consensus around diversity and immigration, and vowed to show the party leaders why they were wrong.

Perhaps mindful that Donald Trump’s nomination represented a repudiation of that Republican autopsy’s recommendations, Democrats have opted to pass on the public self-flagellation. In the process, though, they’ve only hastened the same reckoning that Republicans endured.

The Democratic activist class does not trust its elite representatives; they were sold out to by an opaque and corrupt party. They do not share their representatives’ enthusiasm for road-worn talking points about Reaganomics. They see the rise of Trump as an urgent threat, but their representatives do not appear to share their burning apprehension.

Democrats didn’t make anything better by performing the autopsy on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 prospects behind closed doors.

The tragedy comes after a number of American mass shootings. Here is what you should know.

Las Vegas massacre

Authorities say gunman Stephen Paddock fired on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino — 58 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded.

SWAT teams who stormed Paddock’s room discovered he had killed himself.

Dallas sniper

A sniper killed five Dallas police officers and injured nine more when he opened fire as they guarded protesters demonstrating against police brutality in July 2016. The gunman was identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, who police said “wanted to kill white people.”

Pulse nightclub massacre

Omar Seddique Mateen killed at least 49 people and wounded more than 50 others when he opened fire in Pulse, a gay Orlando nightclub, on June 12, 2016. Mateen eventually was killed by police after a standoff.

That was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history prior to the Las Vegas attack.

San Bernardino shooting

On Dec. 2, 2015, husband and wife Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire at a holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 people and wounding 22 others.

After the shooting, the couple was shot by police more than 40 times combined, and killed.

Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre

In 2012, Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother dead in her home, then drove to the Connecticut school and fatally shot 20 children, between the ages of 6 and 7.

Lanza also murdered school personnel, killing a total of 26 people on Dec. 14, 2012. Lanza then committed suicide.

Binghamton immigration shootings

Fourteen people died, included the perpetrator, after a gunman opened fire at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y. in April 2009.

Police said the shooter was Jiverly Wong, 41, who had trouble speaking English and potentially was made fun of and recently let go from his job.

Virginia Tech massacre

Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho fatally shot 32 people in two locations of the school’s Blacksburg, Va., campus in April 2007. He eventually killed himself.

Virginia Tech’s response to the shootings by the mentally ill student caused schools nationwide to review security protocols.

Columbine High School shooting

In April 1999, two seniors at Columbine High School in Colorado, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, fatally shot 12 students and one teacher, and wounded 21 others before killing themselves.

The school shooting caused law enforcement officials to develop “active-shooter” trainings for police.

Luby’s Cafeteria shooting

George “Jo-Jo” Hennard, an unemployed merchant seaman, shot and killed 23 people and wounded 27 others during the lunchtime rush at Luby’s Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, on Oct. 16, 1991.

Hennard killed himself shortly after the rampage.

During the attack, Hennard reportedly targeted women, whom he called “vipers.”

San Ysidro McDonald’s massacre

On July 18, 1984, James Huberty, 41, fatally shot 21 people and injured 19 others in and around a McDonald’s restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif. Among the dead were children and teenagers.

Huberty later was killed by a SWAT sniper.

University of Texas tower shooting

On Aug. 1, 1966, University of Texas engineering student Charles Whitman climbed to the school’s iconic clock tower and opened fire. Whitman, a former Marine who had earlier murdered his mother and wife, killed 13 and wounded 43 before he was gunned down by police.

Whitman fired at people from his perch on the tower for more than an hour.

Ludlow massacre

Members of the Colorado National Guard plus guards hired by the Colorado Fuel & Iron Co. killed 19 striking coal miners in 1914.

Many of the victims were people of color and immigrants.

Family members of the striking miners, including women and children, hid in pits below tents during the clash between militiamen and the miners. Some were suffocated and died after guards set the tents on fire, according to History.com.

Colfax massacre

On Easter Sunday of 1873, in the bloodiest racial attacks during Reconstruction, white Democrats slaughtered as many as 153 African-Americans at the Colfax, La., courthouse, and later, as other victims were being held prisoner.

Fort Pillow massacre

On April 12, 1864, Confederate soldiers shot dead or fatally bayoneted nearly 300 African-American soldiers fighting for the Union in Henning, Tenn. Nearly all of the victims had surrendered and dropped their weapons when they were killed, according to History.com.

Saltville massacre

Shortly after winning a battle in 1864 near Saltville, Va., Confederate troops killed between 45 and 50 wounded or captured Union soldiers who had been fighting for the North.

Lawrence massacre

Pro-Confederate guerrillas in 1863 killed about 200 civilians and burned down a quarter of Lawrence, Kan., a pro-Union community.

Spirit Lake massacre

In 1857, Native Americans of the Santee Sioux tribe killed 35 to 40 settlers and took four young women captive near West Okoboji, Iowa.

Bloody Island massacre

In 1850, federal troops killed as many as 200 Native Americans of the Pomo tribe on an island in Clear Lake, Calif. The attack was in revenge for the murder of two white settlers by members of another Native American tribe.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe D. Tackitt Jr. said once the shooting began inside the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church, there was likely “no way” for congregants to escape. The youngest victim was 18-months-old, according to officials.

Read on to learn more about the victims in Sunday’s attack.

Annabelle Pomeroy

Pastor Frank Pomeroy and his wife were out of town Sunday during the attack – but their youngest daughter, Annabelle, attended the service. The 14-year-old was among those killed, according to relatives.

""We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,"" Sherri Pomeroy, her mother, told the Associated Press. ""Neither of us has made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the Charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as I can.""

Scott Pomeroy, Annabelle Pomeroy’s uncle, posted a tribute to his niece on Facebook.

“Heaven truly gained a real beautiful angel this morning along with many more,” he said. “I lost a lot of friends and family this morning, but that just means Jesus needed them more.”

""I lost a lot of friends and family this morning, but that just means Jesus needed them more.""

Since the shooting, Scott Pomeroy has also posted on Facebook numerous Bible verses and words of encouragement.

Bryan Holcombe

As the church service continued Sunday morning, Bryan Holcombe, an associate pastor, was walking up to the podium to lead the congregation in worship when the shooting began, according to The Washington Post. His parents, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, said he was killed in the gunfire.

Several of his family members, including his wife, also were killed in the attack, the parents said.

Bryan Holcombe, who was filling in for the pastor, also did prison ministry and would often bring his ukulele to sing for the inmates, his cousin Nick Uhlig told the Associated Press.

“We knew when he was born, that he was going to be a preacher,” Joe Holcombe, his father, told The Washington Post. “His first word was God.”

A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family – especially as so many of the family were killed. The family does have immediate access to the funds, the GoFundMe page states.

“This is too much to bear on their own, let's be the Church!” the page said.

Karla Holcombe

Karla Holcombe, Bryan Holcombe’s wife of more than two decades, was also killed in the attack.

A mother and grandmother, Karla Holcombe was described by friends as a generous and loving person. Like her husband, she had also volunteered at prisons and taught Sunday School classes, the Daily Beast reported.

Bryan and Karla Holcombe owned a canvas repair shop in Floresville, Texas, according to the Daily Beast. They also would often post photos of their children and grandchildren on social media.

“They really were loving people,” friend Jenna Brown told the Daily Beast. “They were about as close to a true life of Christ as you could get.”

The Holcombe's daughter, Sarah Salvin, told the New York Times that she is comforted in knowing her parents' faith.

""I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn't scared,"" she said.

Crystal Holcombe

Crystal Holcombe was killed Sunday in church. She was eight months pregnant, according to the Associated Press.

Before loved ones started to post on her Facebook page, frantically searching to see if she survived the massacre, Crystal Holcombe posted about her two daughters, Megan and Emily, who had done well in their 4-H Club’s food challenge. She also posted earlier this month news that her grandfather had passed away.

The Washington Post reported that she homeschooled her children.

John Holcombe, Crystal’s husband, shared on Facebook Sunday morning that the Sunday School lesson this week was from Exodus on manna from heaven. Typically, that lesson is about God providing for people’s needs.

Facebook users have commented on that public post to express their condolences.

""She doesn't even drink, smoke or nothing,"" her cousin, Nick Uhlig, told the Associated Press. ""She just takes care of kids; she raises goats and makes homemade cheese. That kind of thing, you know? They don't go out dancing or anything like that. They're real old-fashioned, down-to-earth.""

Her in-laws, Bryan and Karla Holcombe, were also killed in the attack.

Joann Ward

Joann Ward, along with some of her children, were killed in the attack, according to the Dallas Morning News.

During the attack, Ward was “shielding [her] babies from the shooter,” Vonda Greek Smith, a friend of Ward’s, said on Facebook.

Two of her children, Emily and Brooke, were reportedly killed in the shooting. Other children, Ryland and Rihanna, were injured in the attack. Smith posted on Facebook that Ward pushed Rihanna, 9, to the ground and prevented her from being shot.

In a message to Fox News, Smith said she would like her friend's ""precious strong motherly heart to be known.""

Emily Garza

Like other children, Emily Garza, 7, was sitting in the back of the church when the shooting began. Her grandmother, Sandy Ward, told MSNBC that she was among those killed.

“I’m numb,” Ward said. “My whole body’s just numb.”

She said the family had been attending the church for several years.

Emily's mother, Joann Ward, was also killed.

Brooke Ward

Brooke Ward, Joann Ward’s 5-year-old daughter, was also killed in the attack, according to the Dallas Morning News.

President Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on North Korea Monday, refusing to rule out eventual military action and declaring that the United States ""will not stand"" for Pyongyang menacing America or its Asian allies.

Trump, on the first stop of his lengthy Asia trip, denounced North Korea as ""a threat to the civilized world,"" and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to cease weapons testing like the missiles he has fired over Japanese territory in recent weeks. Though he stood in one of the Asia capitals in range of North Korea's missiles, Trump did not modulate his fiery language, declaring that Pyongyang imperiled ""international peace and stability.""

""Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,"" said Trump, who stood with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a Monday news conference.

Abe, who has taken a more hawkish view on North Korea than some of his predecessors, agreed with Trump's assessment that ""all options are on the table"" when dealing with Kim Jong Un and announced new sanctions against several dozen North Korea individuals.

Trump and Abe have struck a strong friendship, forged in meetings, phone calls and on the golf course — a friendship that was on display at a Monday evening banquet that was the final event of Trump's visit. In a toast, Trump told the story of how, after he won the election last November, he was bombarded by phone calls from world leaders offering congratulations. Trump said he'd returned just a few — including one from Abe — who said he wanted to meet with Trump as soon as possible. Trump responded: anytime.

Trump, as he told it, wasn't aware of the protocol against president-elects meeting with world leaders. By the time Trump called Abe to wave him off, however, Trump said Abe was already on the plane to New York. ""So I saw him and it worked out just fine,"" Trump recalled, saying, from that moment on, they'd been close.

Abe also called Trump his ""dear friend"" and hailed the benefits of what he called ""golf diplomacy.""

The two men on Monday also put a face on the threat posed by the North, earlier standing with anguished families of Japanese citizens snatched by Pyongyang's agents.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood with nearly two dozen relatives, some of whom held photos of the missing. Seeking to increase pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump pledged to work to return the missing to their families, saying ""it's a very, very sad number of stories that we've heard.""

North Korea has acknowledged apprehending 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, but claims they all died or have been released. But in Japan, where grieving relatives of the abducted have become a symbol of heartbreak on the scale of American POW families, the government insists many more were taken — and that some may still be alive.

Trump has delivered harsh denunciations of Kim, belittling him as ""Little Rocket Man"" but suggested that it would be ""a tremendous signal"" if North Korea returned the captives.

But Trump's message on the second day of his five-country Asian tour was overshadowed by another tragic shooting back home.

Trump called the Texas church shooting that claimed at least 26 lives ""an act of evil,"" denounced the violence in ""a place of sacred worship"" and pledged the full support of the federal government. He later suggested that the shooter had mental health issues and waved off a question about gun control, saying of the massacre, ""this isn't a guns situation.""

Though Trump and Abe repeatedly touted their friendship, looming disagreements on trade could strain the friendship.

Trump complained Monday that Japan had been ""winning"" for decades and rebuked the current relationship, saying the trade deals were ""not fair and not open."" He told a group of American and Japanese business leaders: the United States was open for business, but he wanted to reshape the nations' trade relationship, though he did not say how he would cut the trade deficit with Japan, which totaled nearly $70 billion last year.

He also downplayed the potentially contentious nature of the negotiations, though the Japanese government has not shown much appetite for striking a new bilateral trade agreement. Tokyo had pushed to preserve the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Trump has abandoned.

""We will have more trade than anybody ever thought under TPP. That I can tell you,"" Trump said. He said the multinational agreement was not the right deal for the United States and that while ""probably some of you in this room disagree ... ultimately I'll be proven to be right.""

Abe, for his part, publicly deflected questions about trade.

Trump also pushed Japan to buy more American military equipment after Abe was asked at the news conference about a local news report that Trump was disappointed that Japan had not shot North Korean missiles out of the sky.

""He will shoot 'em out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,"" Trump interrupted.

Japan's constitution was revised after World War II to include a clause renouncing war and the country only spends about one percent of its GDP on defense, though Abe has slowly tried to remove some of its pacifist constraints.

Japan orchestrated a lavish formal welcome for the Trumps, complete with military honor guard and an audience with Japan's Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, at the Imperial Palace.

As part of the pageantry, Trump and Abe took part in a traditional feeding of koi in a pond Monday. At first, both leaders spooned out small amounts of feed into the pond below. Abe then lightly tossed the remainder of his box into the pond below, while Trump more theatrically dumped the rest of his box down to the fish.

Abe laughed.

While you may be thinking that any ol' tortilla chip will do, this is not the case. Making your own chip is ideal, but not always practical. So, when deciding which store bought variation is best, Dawn Perry, a digital food editor for Bon Appétit, warns against going too thin. ""A thin chip may be crunchy and crisp, but it can't take the weight of all of the toppings,"" she says. Make sure your chip can support the weight of whatever toppings you choose.

Cheese is, arguably, the most essential ingredient in nachos after the chips. And the key to great nachos, at least according to Real Simple, is using both a cheese sauce and shredded cheese, divided between the layers of your chips. They also note that some restaurants add spice to their cheese sauces by adding peppers or hot sauce for an extra kick.

Mashed suggests baking only the ingredients you want to be warm — beans, cheese, chips, meat — and keeping your cold ingredients separate. Then, just before you serve, slap on the guac, pico de gallo, sour cream or fresh cilantro or scallion. Not only will this ensure a more flavorful dish, but it also goes a long way toward keeping the nachos from getting soggy and saggy during cooking.

The Care2 petition was launched by Amanda W. of TERA International (Tiger Exotic Animal Ranger Awareness), an organization focusing on the preservation of exotic animals.

""It is illegal to own their body parts or their beautiful fur and importing their remains into the United States is a federal offence,” the petition continues.

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period. Each of these changes will take effect on September 25th.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “We are delighted to unveil this new primetime schedule for both our current and future generation of loyal FNC fans. Over the last decade, Laura’s extraordinary insight, expertise and strong voice have connected with our viewers across the network’s programming. We look forward to her providing the audience with her exceptional commentary, engaging insight and spirited debate.”

Ingraham added, “After a decade working at FOX News with a team of television pros, I am thrilled to be joining the primetime line-up as a host of the 10 o’clock hour. Martha, Tucker and Sean have proven that they understand the pulse of America across the political and the cultural spectrum. I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation. The program will also highlight the importance of faith in our nation and reveal stories that showcase the American spirit.

Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 and most recently served as a contributor, providing political analysis and commentary to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming.

Two years ago, Ingraham also founded LifeZette, a political and cultural website, and will continue to serve as editor, although without a day-to-day operational role.

A graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia School of Law, Ingraham previously served as a litigator and Supreme Court law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. She is also the author of the New York Times bestsellers “The Hillary Trap,” “Shut Up & Sing,” “Power to the People,” and “The Obama Diaries,” among others.

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.



The Wisconsin State Journal reported Saturday that a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to approve the settlement.



Simcakoski's death led to the firing of the Tomah VA's chief of staff, Dr. David Houlihan, who agreed this past January to surrender his medical license permanently. The former head of the center, Mario DeSanctis, was fired in 2015 but fought his dismissal and eventually was allowed to resign, USA Today reported earlier this month. He and his lawyer were paid $163,000, it said.

Simcakoski, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2002, had been treated from 2006 to 2014 for a variety of conditions. He was admitted to the Tomah VA's acute psychiatric unit on Aug. 10, 2014, then transferred to a short stay unit.



On the morning of Aug. 30, 2014, he was so sedated he could barely speak, his family alleged in the lawsuit. He was found unresponsive that afternoon. He died after life-saving attempts were made, although they weren't started for about 10 minutes after he was found.



An autopsy determined that Simcakoski died from mixed drug toxicity. The inspector general found that doctors who prescribed his medications failed to talk with him about the risks, and noted delays in the start of CPR and the lack of medication at the Tomah VA to reverse drug overdoses.

Tackitt told Fox News on Monday authorities believe the gunshot wound that ultimately killed Kelley was ""self-inflicted,"" however, there was also an exchange of gunfire before and during the case.","Shocked former classmates who attended middle and high school with Texas church gunman Devin Patrick Kelley described him Monday as being heavily medicated and someone who kept to himself -- despite a deluge of posts on his apparent Facebook profile about weapons and Atheism.

Kelley -- dressed entirely in black and ""wearing a face mask with a white skull on it,"" according to Texas Department of Public Safety's regional director Freeman Martin -- burst into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday and killed at least 26 people, one as young as 18-months old.

A former middle school classmate told Fox News that Kelley would complain about his parents and medications during school.

“His parents had him on high doses of ‘psych’ meds from 6th to 9th grade, the time I knew him,” said the student, who only wished to be identified as Reid.

The student also said Kelley often posted on his Facebook page about his assault rifle and Atheism, and that “a lot of friends quit talking to him by senior year.”

Courtney Kleiber, a New Braunfels High School student who identified herself as Kelley’s “best friend for a number of years,” said in a Facebook discussion about the shooting that Kelley once was heavily involved with the First Baptist Church.

“I was his best friend for a number of years and he was a happy, caring person back then. It's crazy what time and [mental] illness can do to you,” she wrote.

“Great, now I can't even look through my senior yearbook without seeing this,” she posted on her Facebook page late Sunday, next to a picture of her and Kelley.

Another classmate who spoke to Fox News and wished to remain anonymous described Kelley as a quiet student, though he had his share of friends.

“He recently added me on [Facebook]. I accepted hence we went to school together, and any time I saw him on my timeline he was sharing stuff about guns and being Atheist,” she said. “He was pretty negative. The last post I remember was of a rifle.”

Kelley’s Facebook page has since been taken down.

Chatter amongst other students on Facebook who say they knew Kelley suggested he had a volatile relationship with his parents.

One student said Kelley used to tell her about issues with his dad, while another said they watched Kelley verbally abuse his parents.

Kelley was also a member of his high school’s football team, Reid said. One student said Kelley’s father would go “crazy” if Kelley messed up on the field.

Brittany Adcock, a 22-year-old who told NBC News that she dated Kelley for two months when she was 13 and he was 18, said Kelley would constantly call her after she broke off the relationship.

""He would offer me money to hang out with him quite a bit. There has been one point that I called the police because he was just calling me so much I wanted to report harassment,"" Adcock told the network. ""One time he told me I should move in with him and his wife and that he would take care of me as long as I walked around topless.""

Kelley had previously served in the U.S. Air Force, and was stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and his child, and later received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, in addition to confinement for 12 months, and was reduced in rank.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday said there was a connection between the ""very deranged individual"" and the church where the slayings took place, telling ""FOX & Friends"" that people will learn about a link.

""I don't think the church was just randomly attacked,"" he said. ""I think there was a reason why the shooter chose this church.""

The gunman was also denied a Texas gun permit, according to Abbott.

""He was rejected either because he did not fully answer all the questions that are required to get a Texas gun permit, or he answered those questions wrong, that we still don't know,"" he said.

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt told Fox News that Kelley's former father-in-law did attend the First Baptist Church, but he and his wife were not there Sunday.

His ex-mother-in-law’s P.O. Box was also listed as having a mailing address in Sutherland Springs, the Daily Beast reported.

Kelley previously registered to vote in Colorado in 2014 and listed his address as a parking space in a RV park in Colorado Springs, according to the New York Times.

A woman who lived in the spot next to the address said a man of similar age and description lived in that space for a few months during that time, and that he had a pit bull puppy that was left tied up in the sun all day.

She told the New York Times that there was an incident where police were called because the man -- who she never learned the name of -- struck the dog in the head, leading to a standoff with police in which the man refused to come out of his trailer for an hour.

Records show Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals in August 2014 but the case was dropped, the New York Times reported.

Kelley worked as a security guard for a Texas waterpark this past summer, according to a resume under his name that appeared online.

The suspect, who is from New Braunfels, a suburb outside San Antonio, was found dead in his car after he sped away from the scene of the shooting and was chased by two Good Samaritans.

Tackitt told Fox News on Monday authorities believe the gunshot wound that ultimately killed Kelley was ""self-inflicted,"" however, there was also an exchange of gunfire before and during the case.

""All I know is he stopped another resident right over here and said, 'Lets go we got an active shooter, we need to get him stopped,' and they were chasing him,"" he said. ""They were shooting rounds at him and then he went off the road, we don't know if he was actually hit again or what, but wrecked out. He was from my understanding self-inflicted gun shot wound.""

He was given a deferred probationary sentence and was ordered to pay $368 in restitution. The charge was dismissed in March 2016 after Kelley completed his sentence.

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And, joining us right now it's our privilege to bring the vice president of the United States. If there's somebody more respect on our Capital Hill or by the president I don't know who it is. Mr. Vice President, welcome back.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brian, it's great to be on the program and congratulations on your book. I can't wait to get through it.

KILMEADE: Thank you very much and I'll definitely get it to you if you're allowed - I can never know what the rules are with politicians. If I can actually send it to you or not. I don't want to get you in trouble.

PENCE: Don't worry, I'll get one on my own. I've read a biography in the past of Andrew Jackson but I'm really looking forward to reading yours.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Mr. Vice President, I tell you I know you're as strong on terror as anyone when you were in Congress let alone now. Have we - have your policy now mirroring President Obama's policy of going through the legal system instead of putting him through the military system?

PENCE: Look, well first off let me - let me say as the president has said that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York City. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear to support the efforts of the New York City Police Department to follow through on the investigation.

And, we're going to hold this assailant responsible and if there are any more involved we're going to hold them to the very strictest account. This was a barbaric act of terrorism and it will not stand. And, it is in a very real sense, Brian, we believe, of indication of aggressive posture President Trump has taken in taking the fight to ISIS on their soil on our terms.

As you reported very well on this radio program and on the airwaves of Fox and Friends as we speak thanks to U.S. Armed Forces and our allies ISIS is on the run. We have overtaken the so-called capital of their caliphate Raqqa. There's more fighting to be done but Tuesday was a grim reminder --

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: ... that our enemies are still - are still afoot. They're still inspiring violence that threatens our people and I can assure you President Trump and our entire administration, our Armed Forces will not rest, we will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its sore so it can no longer inspire or make possible these kinds of acts of violence.

KILMEADE: But, Mr. Vice President, he said -

PENCE: I would say that very clearly. But so there's nothing - I got to tell you there's nothing about President Trump's policies that mirror the last administration. I mean, ISIS came to life, was literally conjured out of the - out of the desert policies of the last administration -

KILMEADE: But they brought the battle here, Mr. Vice President and we're not treated like that.

PENCE: Well, they did.

KILMEADE: He's a - he say's he's a soldier of the caliphate. As Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""Why are we treating him like a criminal?"" Here is Ed Davis. He said the way the Boston bombers were treated he said this is the call he got after they got the Zarnia brother. The other one was dead. Cut 24.

ED DAVIS: There's a clause in the Patriot Act that takes the process out of the civilian courts into a military style process. So, in the case of (inaudible) I got a call from the United States Attorney who ordered me to give orders to my officers not to read the suspect their rights.

And, they brought a special team in of intelligence and military personnel because they thought that this may be an ongoing plot. So, there is - there is a possibility of doing that in the law.

KILMEADE: Why didn't we do that? This guy - yes go ahead.

PENCE: Well, Brian, the president made it clear that he was open to sending this assailant, this terrorist to Guantanamo. In fact I think he - the president tweeted this morning that he would have loved to send the New York terrorist to Guantanamo but the process takes longer and justice delayed is justice denied.

KILMEADE: But we Mirandize him. He's got a lawyer. Why did we -

PENCE: We want to see - we want to see - and the president has made it clear he believe this is a case where death penalty is warranted, I agree with that in the strongest possible terms. I mean running down innocent civilians, killing eight, injuring more than 11. This was a barbaric terrorist attack and we want to bring this person - we want to bring this person to justice as swiftly as possible. And, that's what informed the president's decision.

KILMEADE: Right. It's just that I want to question more (ph).

PENCE: I really want to take issue, Brian. I mean the truth is as I began to say moments ago, literally the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq created the vacuum in which ISIS was created -

KILMEADE: Oh, I hear you.

PENCE: Literally overran more than half of Iraq. President Trump came into office and he said we are going to destroy ISIS, we're going to - we're going to allow our military to take the action there, take the fight to terrorists and if anything this vicious terrorist attack in New York is simply a confirmation that in President Trump we have the right leadership.

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: We have the right commander-in-chief who's taking the fight to the enemy.

KILMEADE: I just hope - I hope next time we get them, we don't Mirandized him. We hold onto him until our interrogators are - feel as though they understand what - who he's talked to and what he's capable of. I don't think, as much as I respect New York, I don't think they know everything he knows.

And, they - now has a lawyer and he's smiling with an ISIS flag and he's going to start using our legal system. Even though I know he's going to get convicted and maybe killed, I want to know what he knows and I'm not convinced we can do that now. Are you?

PENCE: Well, let me be - let me be - let me be very clear with all of your millions of listeners around the country, we are going to get to the bottom of this terrorist action, who inspired him, who worked with him. There are - there is an aggressive investigation underway. I was briefed again on it this morning.

I was at the CIA yesterday. As I said, your listeners should be confident. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of New York law enforcement. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to hold him to the strictest and swiftest account and justice.

And, we're going to find if there were any others involved and I can't really speak at this moment about that, if there were any other involved, we will hold them to the strictest account. We're going to bring justice to these people. That's how we protect the American people.

KILMEADE: I want to talk about tax reform, I know you do, too. You're going to - later on you're going to be with Governor Scott in Florida but I also know that you have a - the House is finally ready to unveil tax reform. Can you let our listeners know what we - the takeaways?

PENCE: Well, it's been more than a generation since we've - we've passed the kind of tax cuts and tax reform to really liven the American economy. I mean, john F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan did it, and what really begins today in the House of Representatives, and we believe will - will be completed before the end of this year is going to be a historic tax cut that's going to building on the momentum that we already see in this economy, Brian, it really is remarkable. After eight years, of less than 2 percent economic growth, we just posted the second quarter in a row of over 3 percent growth because of the policies President Trump's been advancing in terms of rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy.

But this tax cut plan, will reduce taxes on individuals, it'll simplify the tax code and it'll lower business taxes in America like the business I'm visiting in Florida, to make it possible for American companies to compete with companies around the world. It is - it is remarkable to think that in the most powerful economy on earth, we have one of the highest business tax rates on the planet.

President Trump is committed to change that, bringing middle class tax relief to working families to simplify the tax code, and the great news for the America people is that all starts today with the introduction of the House tax cut bill.

KILMEADE: Some specifics, if I can. The 20 percent the president spoke about, is that a red line, and is it true that you're considering a phase in of it, a gradual decrease?

PENCE: Well, I think the president - I think the president's made it very clear to members of Congress that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent is absolutely imperative. That puts us in a competitive position, the president - we were talking about going to 15 percent early on, the president made it clear we'll do 20, that's it.

So, people - people, I think, understand hoe firmly the president is committed to that. But the other part of this, don't forget, I grew up in a small business family. My family was in the gas station business, Brian, and - and my family, like - like literally millions of business around the country - my - my folks filed their taxes as individuals, that was business income. And we're going to make sure that we also lower the taxes on people that are reporting large incomes that are business income, we're going to lower that to 25 percent.

I mean, if you look back at 1980's, the majority of jobs that were created, the last time we - we passed historic tax relief, were created in small business America. I'm just saying (ph), 20 percent on big corporations, so called, C-corporations, but we're going to go to 25 percent on - on so called past through small businesses. And - and the combination of this, we - we think - we think the combination of this, it's going to be hard to calculate how - how much the American economy is - is - is going to rally around the tax cuts that we're going to fight to get on the president's desk before Christmas.

KILMEADE: Right, and I know you've got to run, you've got to do another interview, but I understand, Steve Scalise told us today, that it's going - the top bracket is going to stay at 39.5 percent. Would you actually say that too?

PENCE: Well, we'll - I know the House of representatives is going to be unveiling heir plan today, President Trump has made it clear that he wants to focus this tax relief on middle class Americans and on job creators and businesses across this country. And we think that what House Republicans unveil today is a great start in that direction, we're grateful for the leadership of Speaker Ryan, of Chairman Kevin Brady and all those that have been working tirelessly with the administration. The Senate will be moving very quickly on their version of the bill and in the weeks ahead, we're literally going to fight everyday to give the American people the kind of tax cuts and tax reform that will make the American economy great again.

KILMEADE: Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for putting us on your schedule, always appreciate it and you say they're going to get it done before the year's end, that will make a lot of people happy. Thanks so much.

Wilder, who won the 1990 Virginia gubernatorial race to become the first African-American elected U.S. governor, has a long history of backing fellow Democrats for governor.

He backed Mark Warner in 2001 and Terry McAuliffe in 2013, though he didn’t support fellow Democrat Creigh Deeds' failed 2009 bid.

And throughout his roughly 40 years in elected office, Wilder, considered a moderate Democrat, has been noted for his fiscal and law-and-order conservatism.

In this year’s Virginia governor’s race, Wilder has endorsed neither Republican nominee Ed Gillespie nor Democrat Ralph Northam, instead backing Northam running mate Justin Fairfax.

“We do not have the best candidates. I will start off with that,” Wilder, who several years ago declared himself an independent, said in a recent “1947: The Meet the Press Podcast.”

Though Wilder has endorsed neither gubernatorial candidate, the race has attracted some big-name support and endorsements.

President Trump has backed Gillespie via Twitter, saying he’d be a “great” governor and suggesting Northam would be “VERY weak on crime!”

Former President Barack Obama last month stumped in Virginia for Northam, in a race that in the closing weeks has largely become a referendum on which candidate would keep Virginians safer from criminals, including illegal immigrants.

And Hollywood has even gotten into the act.

“I'm writing from the set of my new movie to ask for your help in this critical governor's race in Virginia,” actor Mark Ruffalo wrote in a recent fundraising/get-out-the-vote letter for MoveOn.org. “The stakes in this year's elections couldn't be higher. I'm asking that you help by taking a few minutes to call progressive Virginia voters … and ask them to vote for Ralph Northam.”

Northam leads Gillespie by 5 percentage points, according to a Fox News poll released Monday.

Virginia was the only southern state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in last year’s White House race.

Wilder argued in the podcast that Fairfax, who also is African-American, has been marginalized in the race, which will hurt the Democratic ticket.

“No Democrat is going to get elected in Virginia without strong African-American support,” he said. “Now that you understand that, what do you do to get that vote? You don’t do it by dissing Justin.”

A grandson of slaves, Wilder grew up in poverty and worked his way to becoming one of Richmond’s most successful trial lawyers. Before becoming governor, Wilder served in the state Senate. He was also the mayor of Richmond.

During his term as governor, Wilder was revered by Republicans for being fiscally responsible. Without raising taxes, he set up a “rainy day” account of $200 million -- a revenue fund that since its inception has stabilized the state through many volatile budgets.

Unlike the last gubernatorial election that largely focused on Virginia’s economy, social issues have emerged this year as deciding factors.

One key issue is whether to remove Confederate statues in Virginia.

During the gubernatorial debates in September, Gillespie said that he would preserve the Confederate statues, while Northam called for the statues to be removed. He said that he would prefer to see the statues in museums.

Wilder suggested in the podcast that Northam should focus on educating the public about the Civil War, especially in schools.

“To the extent of saying we are going to spend money to take our monuments and put them in museums, where is that money going to come from when schools are not getting the teachers that we need?” he asked.

Wilder’s advice to both candidates regarding the statues: Let the people of Virginia decide what they want to do.

“If the people want to take it down, take it down, but have consensus to the degree of participation,” he said. “It shouldn’t be done just by saying ‘I want this done.’ You can’t deal with it by knee-jerk actions.""","In close Virginia governor's race, elder statesman Wilder withholds endorsement",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/06/in-close-virginia-governors-race-elder-statesman-wilder-withholds-endorsement.html

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone.
I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.
In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

Evil seems unavoidable -- even in church.

On Sunday, November 5, 2017, America witnessed the deadliest church shooting in her history. The gunman walked into a house of worship outside San Antonio, Texas and opened fire on members of the congregation.

Is God the author of evil? It is the question that challenges all of us during times of unexplained evil acts. If not God, how then do we explain evil?

Without debate, it was a gunman who perpetrated the evil in San Antonio. So it's man and not God? Which brings me to the next question, ""Why didn't God make better creatures?”

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The act didn't just happen; the law of causality teaches us that every event has a cause.

Investigators will spend countless hours trying to understand the motive behind the murder. In the end, the conclusion will be similar to other investigations. The shooter will be found to be unstable, using anti-depressants or inconclusive.

No one seems to want to recognize the existence of an evil being, only evil acts.

The reason that immoral acts bother us and get our attention is that we are moral creatures who know the difference between good and evil.

Jesus made a shocking statement about Judas, the one who betrayed him, ""it would be better for him if he had not been born.""

It's shocking on to think Jesus would make such a statement and equally shocking that Jesus, knowing the world would be better without Judas, allowed Judas to remain.

What is there about good and evil that we don't understand? Is it necessary for both to co-exist, at least for a season? Does evil cause us to strive for good and in our striving permit us to find good? Does God permit evil in this world as a way to produce the best in us? That seems like God is using an illegitimate ""end justifies the means"" ethic.

There is something about evil that drives us to God. Atheist Jean-Paul Sartre said, ""I needed God...I reached out for religion; I longed for it, it was the remedy. Had it been denied me, I would have invented it for myself.”

As a pastor, I struggle to explain the ""why"" behind the senseless evil acts that we witness as human beings. Simple answers to complex questions are bound to be wrong.

So what am I to do? I can give the pat answers that weary all of us, or I can admit my struggle, confront evil and seek to extend the love of God in both good and bad times.","Texas church shooting: God, evil and a senseless act",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/05/texas-church-shooting-god-evil-and-senseless-act.html

Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava were standing with the USS Ashland's commanding officer and others high on the bridgeway when the ship arrived at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, five days after it picked up the women and their two dogs from their boat, 900 miles southeast of Japan.

Appel and Fuiava had left Honolulu on May 3 aboard Appel's 50-foot vessel the Sea Nymph for what was supposed to be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

Storms flooded the engine and damaged the mast and sails so badly, they couldn't generate enough wind power to stay on course. They drifted aimlessly and sent unanswered distress calls for 98 consecutive days.

They were thousands of miles in the wrong direction when a Taiwanese fishing vessel found them. Towing the sailboat damaged it further, but Appel swam to the Taiwanese vessel to make a mayday call.

They'd run out of food for the dogs, and the woman began sharing their own, leaving their food supply 90 percent depleted by the time they were rescued.

The USS Ashland on Wednesday picked up the women, plus the dogs Zeus and Valentine, all four looking remarkably fit for having been lost at sea for nearly six months.

Appel told reporters on Friday that they were beginning to believe they were completely out of luck when they saw the U.S. Navy ship chugging toward them.

""When I saw the gray ship on the horizon, I was just shaking,"" she said then. ""I was ready to cry, I was so happy. I knew we were going to live.""

Although Appel has been sailing the Hawaiian islands for 10 years and spent two years preparing for this voyage, she acknowledged she and Fuiava, a novice sailor, may not have prepared as well as they could have.

Appel credited their survival in part to the veteran sailors in Hawaii who had warned them to prepare well for their journey.

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

Don’t be tempted to do the job yourself — unless you’re a trained electrician, always hire a professional to do electrical work in your home.",9 pro tips for choosing kitchen lighting,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/9-pro-tips-for-choosing-kitchen-lighting.html

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

And if you're investing in an aperitif like vermouth, you want to make them last for as many cocktails as you can.
Montagano notes that the sweeter reds will last a little longer, but don't let it go longer than a month.
""If you go to a dive bar and there's Martini & Rossi on the bar, you know your Negroni will be trash,"" she adds.
""The alcohol component is broken down and reduced, so as long as it isn't completely oxidized, cooking with it is probably fine,"" Montagano explains.","This is the year you finally decide to make proper cocktails at home.

Guess what? You've already messed up. Because one major ingredient in a negroni is going to spoil quickly if you don't get it in the fridge, stat.

Base spirits like vodka, gin, and whiskey — once you start making cocktails, you'll start using phrases like base spirits too — don't have to be refrigerated, but anything wine-based will oxidize and go rancid at room temperature. If you've ever left a bottle of re-corked wine on the counter for a week, you know the despair of musty-smelling, funky-tasting booze gone bad. And if you're investing in an aperitif like vermouth, you want to make them last for as many cocktails as you can.

We chatted with Meaghan Montagano, the bar director and general manager at NYC's Casa Pública to find out the alcohol that you need to refrigerate — and ways to use it up more quickly. (Hint: it involves more drinking. A hardship.)

Vermouth

There should be an extra step when making a Manhattan: Put the vermouth in the fridge. Oxygen hits the liquid immediately after the bottle is opened. Whether it's dry vermouth (maybe you're making a Fifty-Fifty Martini), sweet red vermouth (for Negronis), or the in between bianco (for a new twist on a Negroni), it needs to go in the fridge. Montagano notes that the sweeter reds will last a little longer, but don't let it go longer than a month. ""If you go to a dive bar and there's Martini & Rossi on the bar, you know your Negroni will be trash,"" she adds. To know if something has gone bad, be sure to taste a sip when you first open the bottle. It should be bright and complex. As it oxidizes, it will be flat and dull, and when it's really bad, it could smell like a wet dog. This rule applies for any wine product.

Sherry and Port

Sherry is tougher to give a time frame on how long it can stay in the fridge, but it should definitely be cold as long as you have it. Montagano suggests buying a smaller bottle, like a 375 ml, to test out how much you'll use it. Fortified wines typically last the longest — Pedro Ximenez, a hearty, sweet dessert Sherry, could go for three months — but some more delicate varieties like Fino could spoil after a week. The same applies to Port, another fortified wine.

Marsala and Madeira

If you have a little Marsala or Madeira wine as an after-dinner drink, tuck it away in the fridge afterward. The good news is that if you use that same Marsala to cook chicken Marsala with later, you'll have a little wiggle room to let it sit for a month or two in the fridge. ""The alcohol component is broken down and reduced, so as long as it isn't completely oxidized, cooking with it is probably fine,"" Montagano explains. The flavor just won't be as bright. The same rule applies to that bottle of white wine sitting in the fridge for a few weeks — use it for clam sauce if it hasn't turned!

Apertifs Like Lillet and Cocchi Americano

French Lillet is a smoother, floral, citrusy aperitif that you can drink on its own or in a Bond-approved Vesper martini, while Italian Cocchi Americano is more bitter and better paired simply with club soda and orange. No matter which you prefer in your Corpse Reviver No. 2 cocktail, they both need to stay in the fridge. Montagano recommends either over ice with a lemon twist. Lillet Rouge (red) will last the longest — up to a month — while the Blanc and Rosé styles will only go for a few weeks. Alternatively, Cocchi Rosa, the red-wine-based aperitif, will last longer than the white varietal.

Cream Liqueur

Spike your eggnog with Baileys or Kahlua, but put it in the fridge. It's probably already there — because who wants to drink warm Baileys?! — but just in case, we need you to know. Montagano recommends trying El Dorado Golden Rum Cream, which is made with aged rum and has a toffee-like flavor.

Now that your fridge is going to be full of aperitifs and fortified wines, don't use them only for cocktails — try a glass on the rocks with a twist of citrus. Low ABV drinks are popular in Europe and ideal for day-drinking. And if you'd rather go big, make a punch or sangria when something is starting to turn.",5 types of alcohol that belong in the refrigerator,http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/11/06/5-types-alcohol-that-belong-in-refrigerator.html

FOX NEWS - The gunman suspected of opening fire at a church in Texas on Sunday has been identified to Fox News as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.

Kelley, according to officials, killed at least 26 people and wounded approximately 20 after he unleashed a hail of bullets in the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, in the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history.

The gunman previously served in the U.S. Air Force, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. Kelley served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and his child. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, in addition to confinement for 12 months and was reduced in rank.

Kelley worked as a security guard for a Texas waterpark this past summer, according to a resume under his name that appears online.

Investigators said Kelley didn't appear to be connected to any organized terrorist groups.

The suspect, who is believed to be from New Braunfels, a suburb outside San Antonio, was found dead in his car after he sped away from the scene of the shooting. Officials said it remained unclear whether he was shot dead by police or an armed nearby resident, or if he died from a self-inflicted wound.

Police didn’t name Kelley during a press conference, but only described him as a white male in his 20s.

Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are duking it out Tuesday in the Old Dominion commonwealth's gubernatorial race. Just one of two states electing governors this year, Virginia is a swing state contest viewed as a possible referendum on Trump's first year in office.

Northam leads Gillespie by 5 percentage points in Fox News' latest polling average. Trump lost to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points in Virginia during the 2016 presidential election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This isn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it comes to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touts his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for re-election, Northam, 58, would be expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He is for greater gun control and abortion rights. He has also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,” according to his campaign website.

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. The pair has two children, a son who is a neurosurgery resident and a daughter who is working as a web developer.

Endorsements and ads

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate hasn’t totally embraced the president or his politics on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Trump also accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He has also called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

Advertisements from both sides have been criticized as the race heads to a close.

Northam’s campaign came under fire for a Democratic mailer that shows Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam has stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Another highly criticized ad – this one from the nonprofit Latino Victory Fund – shows scared minority children being chased by a truck with a “Gillespie for governor” sticker, a Gadsden flag vanity license plate and Confederate flag.

“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?” a narrator asks in the one-minute spot.

Display nothing; This is on Publish with no configured Image

Chris Leavitt, Gillespie’s campaign manager, slammed the advertisement as “an all-out attack on the people of Virginia” and blamed “Northam and his allies” for what he called a “desperate smear campaign.”

Northam’s supporters “have reached a new low with a disgusting, vile televison ad seeking to instill fear in our children with that same imagery,” Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News.

Northam's campaign has defended the ad. Campaign spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said in a statement that, ""It's not shocking that communities of color are scared of what his Trump-like policy positions mean for them.""

Gillespie, too, has been criticized for ads in support of his campaign. He has released several ads that attempt to tie Northam to the MS-13 gang.

One ad in particular shows a sinister hooded figure holding a baseball bat as the word’s “Kill, Rape, Control” – MS-13’s motto – flash on the screen. The ad accuses Northam of being “weak” on combating the gang.

The Northam campaign has called Gillespie’s ads “beyond the pale.”

Bush hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia earlier this month. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York earlier this month. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama also campaigned with Northam earlier in October, and Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., will show his support at an event later this week.

By Jason Whitlock, For The Wall Street Journal



The critics of National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell are only getting louder. Last week Papa John’s Pizza CEO John Schnatter assailed Mr. Goodell for bungling the national anthem protests. “The NFL has hurt us by not resolving the current debacle to the players’ and owners’ satisfaction,” said Mr. Schnatter, whose company is a high-profile sponsor. “Leadership starts at the top, and this is poor leadership. . . . This should’ve been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago.”

Meanwhile, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, is trying to block an extension of Mr. Goodell’s contract. The commissioner’s current deal expires at the end of the 2018 season. NFL insiders originally expected the deal to be extended this past summer. Mr. Jones, who owns more than 100 Papa John’s franchises in Texas, has reportedly been rallying support among fellow owners to oust Mr. Goodell.

Asked Friday about Mr. Schnatter’s rebuke of the commissioner, Mr. Jones hailed the pizza tycoon as a “great American.” Speaking on a radio show Tuesday, he was even more explicit about Mr. Goodell: “I know a lot of people, a lot of fans, don’t think we make him as accountable as we should,” Mr. Jones said. “But that’s not the case. It’s just timing. When you have to account is when you’re either getting hired or you’re getting extended or you’re getting a raise or are you getting a bonus.”

In other words, the time for action has arrived—and Mr. Goodell has a lot to account for. Concern over head injuries has eroded football’s public support. Mr. Goodell’s handling of player discipline, particularly the 2014 Ray Rice domestic-violence case and the 2015 New England Patriots “Deflategate” scandal, damaged the NFL’s image. Now unending national-anthem protests have frustrated the league’s conservative fans, made it a target for President Trump, and contributed to sliding TV ratings.

It makes sense to blame ineffective leadership. But what if the problem is effective leadership? Football is headed exactly where Mr. Goodell has steered it—to the left. The NFL has long been a combatant in America’s larger culture war. But Mr. Goodell—whose father, Charles, was a liberal antiwar Republican senator in the late 1960s—was always an odd choice to run it.

Fox News: How did this movie come together?

Peter Ferriero (Director): When I started making the movie “The Price of Fame” I initially thought I wanted to find out where all my childhood heroes were. ...Because of his character the Million Dollar Man, he had to actually pay for things and be the Million Dollar Man 24/7.

I’ve talked to a lot of guys that he rode with, they all saw his life and the adultery and everything he was doing on the road and that was the beginning of the downfall of Ted DiBiase or the Million Dollar Man, but it was also the start of the rise and the redemption of who he would become.

Fox News: Who is Ted DiBiase today?

DiBiase: Today I am Ted DiBiase, not the wrestler, but now I am a minister. I travel all over the United States basically in evangelism, speaking in churches, speaking in prisons, speaking in rehab centers wherever I can basically sharing my story of redemption and the turnaround in my life.

That’s why this film was titled “The Price of Fame."" Now I want to be careful with saying the price of fame is whatever you make it. We all make individual decisions, but it’s like a lot of the things that come a long with being famous. You got to build accountability into your life or it’s very easy for it to take you down.

A post shared by Ted DiBiase (@mdmteddibiase) on Aug 14, 2017 at 3:32pm PDT

Fox News: What do you hope people will take away from this movie?

Ferriero: I think one of the biggest takeaways I would like for people to have watching the movie is that you can really change your life in a flash. And sometimes forgiveness can not only benefit the person but yourself as well.

DiBiase: The really important things in life, and I found out the hard way because I found all those things at the end of the day to be empty. Because if I don’t have a wife and a family who loves and respects me, if I don’t have their respect and if I’m not living my life in such a way that I’m being open and honest with them than what do I really have.

I’ve been traveling and speaking in churches and all these other places for 17 years now and I’m still going. I tell people all day who say ""When you going to retire?"" I said I never found the word retirement in the bible, so I’m going to keep going till I’m not here.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

Sometimes it’s the unassuming gesture that makes the most profound impact on your life.

We never set out to build a museum for the Bible. We were happy raising our children and helping to run the family business.

We thought that someone else was going to put the museum together, and we were content to acquire items, then donate them to the museum.

Little did we know that when we agreed to help acquire a biblical artifact, our future had changed.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

We had to ask ourselves, “What would it look like for us to keep the dream alive and work toward building a museum to house all these wonderful ancient biblical artifacts?” That thought was, honestly, overwhelming.

But the deeper question we had to ask and answer for ourselves was, “What does it mean for us to take this journey?”

The answer to that question is the premise for our new book, ""This Dangerous Book."" It’s an answer that unfolds like an archaeological dig, layers upon layers removed until the experience of discovery makes us smile in delight.

We discovered how precious these artifacts are. They are also precious to all kinds of people, all over the world.

So many people of different faith traditions have pulled us aside and expressed their gratitude for this project.

It’s one of the most rewarding aspects of our journey in building a museum.

We’ve found a remarkable sense of unity around this ancient text. That excites and inspires us.

Holding up the Bible as this wonderful human treasure invites people of all walks of life to come and see, explore, and discover this gift of history.

It is astounding that so many people from different parts of the world—people of different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and languages—all meet up around one book that was written thousands of years ago.

At the same time, we recognize that today in America, the Bible does not possess the same centrality that it did at our country’s founding.

Journalist and author Kenneth Briggs observes, “For more and more Americans, the Bible has become a museum exhibit, hallowed as a treasure but enigmatic and untouched. Snippets of its languages still pop up occasionally in political speeches. But overall, the Bible is overridden by consumer appetites and a growing array of lifestyles that . . . offer ways of thinking about life, love, and work that have left the Bible behind.”

We believe, however, that this is only partially true of our culture. It may be that we are simply not as skeptical as Mr. Briggs, but our observation is that yes, although our culture does not know the Bible as it once did, there is real longing to know it better.

We can all, as a nation and as collective humanity, observe, appreciate, study, and discuss this book. So much wonder and mystery surrounds not only the Bible itself, as a cultural artifact, but also its claims, its narrative, and its ultimate message.

Our journey with the museum reminds us how God leads us with a journey in mind. We were working for our family business and trying to help some others in their worthy endeavor.

As the collection grew, the family started feeling the responsibility of it. We had been entrusted with the items, and we felt we needed to be sure the dream of a museum became a reality.

The idea was not new to the family; my brother had mentioned more than once over the years the idea of building a Bible museum. He was building a chain of Christian bookstores and carried one of the largest selections of Bibles available.

So little by little, we embraced the dream.

One of the first ideas as a result was opening a traveling exhibit. I (Steve) have said that we, my family, are not collectors. My dad operates by the philosophy that if you buy a new shirt, an old shirt has to go. We were acquiring artifacts not because we were collectors but because we wanted to tell their story.

The problem was, our closet was getting full, and we had no idea when we would be opening a museum. We had no location or date; it was only a dream at the time. That’s when the idea for a traveling exhibit was birthed. We could start telling the incredible story of the items we had acquired, while the idea of the museum developed.

Toward the end of 2010, we had a two-day planning meeting for a Bible exhibit. We wanted to open the exhibit in 2011, launching it with the celebration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the King James Version of the Bible. The King James Version is the most printed version of the Bible, and we thought that would be a great opportunity to launch an exhibit.

In 2011, we successfully opened our U.S. version of a traveling exhibit at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art.

This was the beginning of a journey, a journey with an unknown destination. Not too long after we opened the Oklahoma City exhibit, through some contacts at American Bible Society, discussions began about having an exhibit at the Vatican. We had just finished a race to open the first exhibit, and now the race was on again, as the desired opening for the exhibit at the Vatican was during the lenten season of 2012. We successfully opened the exhibit for the lenten season, which was the first of other international exhibits to come.

Before the museum opened, we had also traveled to Jerusalem, Argentina, Cuba, and Germany. We also traveled to several universities across the U.S., with exhibits of varying sizes.

Over the next five years, the exhibit traveled to five cities total, with its last tour ending in 2016 in Santa Clarita, California. It had grown from a fifteen-thousand-square-foot exhibit in Oklahoma City to a forty-thousand-square-foot exhibit before it was closed.

Back in 2011, none of this had been in sight.

Steve and Jackie provide unique insight and commentary into the Bible’s role in our culture and in their personal life. Since 2009 they have been planning for the presentation of various archaeological finds pertaining to the Bible and the world’s most impressive display of materials relating to the Bible’s original writings, its preservation, and its distribution around the globe.

Q: Is there such a thing as a TV Guide for programs, movies and shows that are streaming online? I want a real simple way to see what’s available on Amazon vs. Apple vs. Hulu vs. YouTube vs. Roku and all the others!

A: There are so many different streaming services available, and each provides a different blend of programming. As you’ve pointed out, it’s hard to tell what flicks and shows are available on each service, especially when titles appear and vanish so unpredictably. You’ll be happy to hear that several different sites have answered the call and can summarize these streaming catalogs at a glance. Click here for easy-to-follow guides to streaming content.

Adjust TV volume

Q: The dialogue on my TV is awful. I can hardly hear people, but the sounds are loud. How can I fix this?

A: When you bring a new TV into your home, it arrives with a lot of arbitrary settings: tint, color, contrast and so on. The volume controls are nearly as important as the picture, because they can dramatically affect the sound of the dialogue, ambient noise and music. There are many ways to fix this problem, but if you’re not accustomed to working with speakers and acoustics, you’ll need a little guidance. Click here to learn about a hidden volume setting.

Comparing smart temperature controls

Q: I was thinking about getting a smart thermostat to save money on heating bills. Is the Nest or Ecobee the better choice?

A: Most of our monthly energy bills relate to the heating and cooling of our homes, and the smarter your thermostat is, the less energy you’ll use. The exciting part of both systems is that they will automatically adapt to your household’s needs. You just have to set the thermostat to its regular settings for about a week, and the internal computer will figure out the rest. Both systems are excellent, but there are a few clear differences. Click here for my recommendation on smart thermostats.

Apple’s virus vulnerability

Q: Is it true that Apple users will never get ransomware?

A: It's true that Apple devices and apps are significantly less vulnerable to viruses and malware than their competitors’ products, but that doesn’t mean your iMac is invincible. In fact, cybercriminals are working around the clock to find new ways to hack into Apple devices, and a new kind of Apple-specific ransomware is now at large. So if you’re dedicated to Mac, the time has come for you to think about protecting yourself. If there are any chinks in your armor, you can bet there’s a hacker who will find them, no matter what brand of computer you own. Click here to learn about new ransomware targeted at Apple products.

Investing in Tech

Q: I invest in the market. What are the best tech stocks?

A: When I was a kid, my dad and I used to pore over the financial pages, and I have been following the stock market religiously ever since. We both know that the market can take unpredictable turns, but certain companies have outstanding records when it comes to profitability, and there is definitely a shortlist of great tech stocks. These companies are all performing very well, and shares are not cheap, but you can expect them to remain stable or even increase in value in the next few years.

In a hearing Monday, a federal judge said she's inclined to remove from house arrest the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign and his business associate. But U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson did not immediately rule at Monday's court session, saying she needs more financial information from Manafort and Gates.

Manafort has offered up his three residences and life insurance policies toward a $10 million bail. Gates has offered up his residence and life insurance policies toward his $5 million bail.

Both have to prove to the government their actual holdings with those dollar amounts if they want to be released from home confinement and GPS monitoring.

The men have been indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. They are accused of laundering the profits of foreign consulting work performed on behalf of a Ukrainian political party and concealing those assets from the U.S. government.

They have pleaded not guilty.

Jackson says that once she receives the additional financial information, she is prepared to lift the home confinement requirement but with certain restrictions, such as a bar on international travel.

Jackson told the defendants she is ""very disinclined to allow international travel"" and said she is leaning toward limiting their travel to the Washington area, with the exception of Richmond for Gates.

Jackson also said she’s unsure when the trial may begin, despite a previously reported start date of May 7. The judge said that will depend on the pace of discovery.

Getting 200,000 miles of use—or more—from a vehicle is an impressive feat, but it’s not impossible. Owners should be aware, though, that as a vehicle approaches that milestone, many of its components will start to wear out.

You’ll see some warning signs, or red flags. Pay attention to them and you can avoid the double whammy of being stranded and slapped with an expensive, unexpected repair.

To help out owners trying to reach that 200,000-mile mark, we compiled estimates of the expenses involved to fix these common problems. Using a 2010 Toyota Camry with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, located in northern New Jersey, as our model car, we used the free Consumer Reports Car Repair Estimator to determine the costs. Powered by CR’s partner RepairPal, it provides regional estimates for repair work; your actual costs may differ. Remember to shop around for the best deals.

These repairs are ordered from the most expensive to the least expensive to complete.

1. Brakes

What are the warning signs? “A spongy or sinking brake pedal can be a sign of a failing brake master cylinder,” says CR's chief mechanic, John Ibbotson. If you live in the snow belt, make sure to check the hard brake lines for rust or weak spots.

Can I do it myself? Unless you’ve worked on brakes with someone else (like helping a parent years ago), this is a job for a qualified mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Brake Master Cylinder $294-$375 $216-$306 Brake Calipers (front, both side) $235-$300 $260-$918 Brake Rotors and Pads (rear, both sides) $235-$300 $243-$890 Brake Rotors and Pads (front) $127-$163 $215-$402 Brake Rotors and Pads (rear) $127-$163 $195-$345 Brake Fluid Flush $112-$156 $34-$56

What happens if I ignore the red flag? In the worst-case scenario, you’ll have a brake failure and end up in a crash. In the best scenario, you’ll wear the brake pads down to their metal backing plates, resulting in poor braking performance and a loud metal-on-metal noise when you try to stop the car.

CR's best advice: You should have your brakes checked regularly and change the brake fluid as recommended in the owner’s manual. Don’t do the work yourself unless you are absolutely confident in your ability.

2. Mechanical Components Reaching the End of Life

What are the warning signs? Even the strongest original parts can wear out. “Don’t go cheap on replacement parts in order to save a few bucks,” Ibbotson says. “If you replaced worn parts with substandard knockoffs, they might be on their way to failure much sooner than the original equipment.” Slow cranking of the engine can be a sign of a failing battery or alternator.

Can I do it myself? If you're mechanically inclined and used to working on cars, you can probably replace the alternator and maybe the power steering pump. But it’s best to have a mechanic handle the steering rack.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Alternator $98-$125 $271-$649 Power-Steering Pump $186-$238 $204-$409 Steering Rack $726-$925 $410-$904

What happens if I ignore the red flag? If your alternator fails, your car has no way of charging the battery. Eventually the vehicle will leave you stranded, either from a lack of battery voltage or because you won’t be able to start it. A bad power-steering pump means it will get more difficult to turn the wheels. Ignoring the steering rack can be dangerous because you might lose the ability to steer.

CR's best advice: Don’t mess around with steering components; get them handled ASAP. And don't ignore a bad or failing alternator. Note that some premium parts may come with a lifetime warranty, so be sure to ask when buying.

3. Noisy Exhaust System

What are the warning signs? “You can tell that your exhaust system is reaching the end of its life because your car will get increasingly louder,” Ibbotson says. Exhaust leaks can be dangerous and should be repaired at the first sign.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Catalytic Converter $127-$163 $874-$1,301 Exhaust Manifold $137-$175 $325-$750

What happens if I ignore the red flag? Exhaust fumes will eventually enter the vehicle and could make occupants ill.

CR's best advice: You should have a mechanic or a muffler/exhaust shop do the repairs. And don’t go with cheap catalytic converters; they probably won’t last very long and you’ll be back in the same situation in a couple of years.

4. Electrical Components Beginning to Fail

What are the warning signs? “Don’t be surprised if features such as power windows, windshield wipers, and even the instrument panel go on the fritz,” Ibbotson says. “The gremlins can be frustratingly difficult to trace.”

Can I do it myself? The door and window components can be handled by a home mechanic who has experience working on cars. The windshield parts are trickier to work on, but it's still something a competent amateur mechanic can handle. But the oxygen sensors should be replaced by a professional mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Windshield Wiper Motor $78-$100 $187-$227 Windshield Washer Pump $49-$63 $35-$54 Power Door Lock Actuator $88-$113 $292-$323 Door Window Regulator $127-$163 $101-$164 Door Window Motor $98-$125 $239-$488

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You may not be able to lock or unlock your door or raise and lower the windows if you ignore those components. Your windshield will be messy and difficult to see through if you don’t fix the washer pump or wiper motor.

CR's best advice: Keeping the windshield clean isn’t just an appearance issue, it’s a safety one, too. Get that handled ASAP. The door and window components are somewhat less important—unless you can’t lock your car manually or the windows are stuck open in the winter!

5. Moisture Buildup

What are the warning signs? If it seems that the inside of your windshield is always fogging up or you are mysteriously losing coolant, it’s likely that the heater core is starting to fail.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Heater Core $1,029-$1,313 $207-$386

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You'll notice poor defrosting capability that results in decreased visibility. If left for too long, it can result in the engine overheating, leading to engine damage.

CR's best advice: “Even the smallest pinholes will cause interior fogging,” Ibbotson says. “It’s most likely going to be an expensive repair, because the heater core is under the dashboard.” Use a high-quality replacement unit to avoid having to repeat the repair again too soon.

6. Outdated Shocks and Struts

What are the warning signs? Does your car bounce up and down as you drive down the road? You may need new shocks or struts, Ibbotson says. Uneven tire wear is also an early indicator of this.

Can I do it myself? Not unless you own a lot of tools, are very handy, and have plenty of time. Make an appointment with a mechanic.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Front Struts/Shocks $284-$363 $278-$412 Rear Struts $324-$413 $326-$510

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You'll experience poor or dangerous handling, and you could wind up with excessive and uneven tire wear.

CR's best advice: Get it done as soon as you notice the warning signs in order to avoid any safety issues.

7. Failing Radiator

What are the warning signs? “A failing radiator or thermostat can cause the engine to run too hot or eventually overheat,” Ibbotson says. Low fluid levels in the coolant reservoir could indicate a leak in the radiator, engine, hoses, or all three.

Can I do it myself? No.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Radiator Hose Replacement $255-$325 $60-$93 Thermostat Replacement $137-$175 $40-$64 Radiator Replacement $304-$388 $295-$601

What happens if I ignore the red flag? An engine that runs too hot can overheat, damaging the internal parts. This could result in the engine failing, forcing you to get a replacement.

CR's best advice: Routinely check and top off your vehicle’s coolant, especially before long road trips. If the fluid level looks low or you see the engine temperature is often very high, make an appointment with a mechanic as soon as possible.

8. Oil Consumption and Leaks

What are the warning signs? Increased oil consumption is common in older cars, so don’t panic if your car seems thirstier the older it gets. But if you think you’re topping off the oil too much, it could be a sign of a bigger leak.

Can I do it myself? An oil and filter change can be done by most competent home mechanics who have the proper tools. But it usually isn’t worth the savings to do it yourself because you still have to dispose of the oil. If you think there's a leak or the oil light has come on in your car, immediately check the oil level. Then take the vehicle to a professional to find out what's wrong.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Oil and Filter $27-$62 (labor & parts) Oil Leak Diagnosis $98-$125 $0 Engine Oil Light Diagnosis $98-$125 $0 Valve Cover Gasket $88-$113 $28-$41

What happens if I ignore the red flag? Oil lubricates the engine parts and helps dissipate heat. So running out of oil will result in the internal engine parts contacting each other directly and wearing out prematurely. Never changing the oil will result in the engine seizing; if that happens, it will have to be replaced.

CR's best advice: Routinely check and top off your vehicle’s oil between changes, especially before long road trips.

9. Spark Plugs That Haven't Been Changed

What are the warning signs? If you haven’t changed the plugs in 100,000 miles of use, the engine runs rough and misfires, or you have trouble starting your car, you should replace the spark plugs. Buying the right kind and getting the right service can make all the difference.

Can I do it myself? While spark plugs come pre-gapped—that is, there's the appropriate amount of space between the center and side electrodes of the plug—you have to use a special tool to make sure they are gapped to your car’s requirements. If it isn’t gapped properly, the plug won’t make a spark to ignite the gas. Make sure you buy the right type of plug for your make and model at an auto-parts store. With cars built before the 1990s, you can probably do the job yourself. But with most newer models, Ibbotson recommends having the dealer or a certified repair shop handle it.

What's the Cost? Labor Parts Spark Plug Replacement $59-$75 $48-$72

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You might see your fuel economy and engine performance get worse.

CR's best advice: If maintained well, spark plugs can last 100,000 miles. By the 200,000 mark, you could be overdue for installing a third set of plugs. Make an appointment with your dealer or a trusted mechanic to have the work done.

10. Rust

What are the warning signs? It starts with paint that looks like it has bubbles forming. Once you see even a little bit forming around the wheel wells, hood, trunk, or suspension mounting points, there could be a serious problem beneath the surface.

Can I do it myself? No.

What’s the cost? It depends on the extent of the damage. If you have rust, get several competing estimates on the work.

What happens if I ignore the red flag? You can patch surface rust, but that will only slow down the problem. Replacing body panels on a 200,000-mile car can be expensive. At this point, the clock has started ticking on how much longer you’re going to keep the car.

CR's best advice: Have a professional repair shop check to see whether it’s surface rust or there's a structural weakness that will make your car less safe in a crash.

The small Swedish automaker’s Agera RS supercar has claimed the title of World’s Fastest Production Car at 277.9 mph. And it’s even faster than that.

The record was set Saturday on a closed 11-mile stretch of Nevada State Road 160 outside Las Vegas. The 1,341 hp car made two runs on the dead-straight highway, one in each direction, and its speeds were averaged as required for Guinness-recognized world record.

On the first, Koenigsegg test driver Niklas Lilja hit 271.2 mph, fast enough to best the unofficial one-way record of 270.39 mph set by the Hennessey Venom GT in 2014. The return run at 284.6 mph simply left the Hennessey and every other car ever made in the desert dust. That includes the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which has held the official record of 267.8 mph since 2013.

Official certification of the record is forthcoming, but in-car video evidence of the run was released by Racelogic, the company that provided the data logging equipment for the attempt.

The roughly $2 million Agera RS is powered by a 5.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that delivers power to the rear wheels. And it's not just fast, but it can accelerate, too. The car also set a new mark for the 0-400-0 run at 33.87 seconds, breaking its own record of 36.44 seconds achieved just a month ago.

Attempts to break the top speed record should be coming soon.

Bugatti has a new 1,600 hp car called the Chiron that’s more powerful than the Veyron Super Sport, and its own private test track in Germany to play on. Meanwhile, Hennessey just last week (in Las Vegas, coincidentally) unveiled its upcoming Venom F5, which it claims will be able to go faster than 300 mph.",The 278 mph Koenigsegg Agera RS is the new world's fastest car,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/11/06/278-mph-koenigsegg-agera-rs-is-new-worlds-fastest-car.html

But Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel told Fox News that, despite the disclosure, the campaign had nothing to do with the ad.","Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam’s campaign is being accused of playing a role in a controversial ad that was pulled last week, as disclosure forms reveal ties to the political group behind the incendiary commercial – though the Democrat’s campaign denies it.

The ad shows a Confederate-flag-flying pickup truck with a bumper sticker for Northam's opponent, Republican Ed Gillespie, chasing down and cornering several Hispanic and Muslim children in a dark alley. The ad sparked outrage as Gillespie and others condemned it for falsely portraying his supporters as violent racists, ahead of Tuesday’s gubernatorial election.

A group called Latino Victory Fund created the ad but pulled it after a terrorist reportedly shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" murdered eight people in New York City using a pickup truck.

Northam distanced his campaign from the ad, telling WAVY-TV, ""That commercial did not come from our campaign. It certainly is not a commercial that I would have wanted to run.""

But disclosure forms suggest the Northam campaign may have been involved, as the Northam campaign reported a $62,729.60 ""in-kind"" contribution in the form of ""media"" from the Latino Victory Fund shortly after the ad came out. Under Virginia law, a media contribution is ""in-kind"" only if the campaign worked with the outside group on the ad.

Phil Kerpen, president of free-market think tank American Commitment, first discovered the disclosure.

""Northam claimed to know nothing about the ad -- on the very same day his own campaign filed an official disclosure accepting the ad as an in-kind contribution,"" Kerpen said.

He points to Virginia law, which says a campaign must have direct involvement in a project for it to be an ""in-kind"" contribution:

""...the candidate or an agent of the candidate's campaign committee must have either expressly requested or suggested... that the expenditure be made,"" a Virginia government guidebook describing the law reads, ""or... have material involvement in devising the strategy, content, means of dissemination, or timing of the expenditure.""

But Northam spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel told Fox News that, despite the disclosure, the campaign had nothing to do with the ad.

""The Northam campaign did not authorize the ad nor did it see the ad before it was released,"" she said in a statement, adding that, ""Ralph Northam would not have run this ad and believes Virginians deserve civility, not escalation.""

About the disclosure documents, she said it was only reported that way because the campaign worked with Latino Victory Fund in other ways: ""In Virginia, groups must report in-kinds for activities like canvassing and data-sharing. Because there are no independent expenditures, and Latino Victory Fund has been sharing data with us, they had to report any activity involving the election as an in-kind.""

But Kerpen noted that it was the Northam campaign, not Latino Victory Fund, that labelled the ad as an in-kind contribution -- a fact that can be confirmed on the Virginia Department of Elections website -- and said the group's other activities like canvassing have nothing to do with how the ad would be treated in disclosure forms.

Yheskel did not respond to a follow-up question about the fact that the disclosure came from Northam's campaign.

Kerpen also challenged Yheskel's explanation of the law, saying, ""If Northam had not coordinated on the expenditure, they would have filed nothing related to it"" -- since it would not have been an ""in-kind"" contribution under the law.

Could the Northam campaign have simply made the disclosure by mistake, thinking they had to do so because they worked with the group in other ways?

""No chance they filed by mistake -- they would have said so and corrected immediately,"" Kerpen said, decrying the ad as “race-baiting.”

Latino Victory Fund did not respond to questions about any coordination with the Northam campaign.

A friend likens The New York Times to a 1960s adolescent who refuses to grow up. In a perpetual state of outrage, it is a newspaper of college snowflakes who embrace all forms of diversity except thought.

It sees its liberal politics not as a point of view, but as received wisdom that cannot be legitimately disputed.

A tight race is hardly a surprise, as the Old Dominion State has been a swing state in recent years.
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R).","With the election just a day away, Democrat Ralph Northam holds a five-point edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in the close race to succeed Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe.

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Virginia likely voters conducted Thursday through Sunday evenings.

Neither candidate receives majority support, as Northam garners 48 percent to Gillespie's 43 percent. That leaves 1-in-10 voters either undecided (7 percent) or opting for Libertarian Cliff Hyra or another candidate (3 percent) -- which could make a difference come Tuesday.

Northam’s advantage is at the poll’s 2.5 percentage-point margin of sampling error. Last month he had a 7-point lead (49-42 percent, October 15-17, 2017).

Nearly all Northam (94 percent) and Gillespie supporters (91 percent) are certain of their vote choice and both candidates receive strong backing from their party faithful (93 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Republicans respectively).

Independents are a mixed bag, as nearly one-third favors the Democrat, one-third backs the Republican, and another one-third backs the libertarian or is undecided.

Northam is favored by blacks by 79 points (86-7 percent), moderates by 32 (55-23), voters with graduate degrees by 30 (61-31), women by 20 (56-36), and those with a college degree by 18 (54-36).

READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS

The key groups preferring Gillespie include conservatives by 59 points (76-17 percent), white evangelical Christians by 57 (73-16), whites without a college degree by 43 (67-24), and men by 9 (49-40).

Gillespie is also the pick for veterans by 20 points (55-35 percent), despite the fact that Northam is an Army vet.

By far, the economy (24 percent) and health care (24 percent) are the top two concerns for voters. Those prioritizing health care back Northam by 49 points (69-20 percent). Economy voters go for Gillespie by a narrower 25-point spread (58-33 percent).

Meanwhile, voters are more likely to blame Gillespie for how ugly the race has gotten: 50 percent say he has attacked Northam unfairly, while 39 percent say the Democrat made unfair attacks.

Overall, voters rate Northam positively by 16 points (53 percent favorable vs. 37 percent unfavorable) and Gillespie by 10 (51-41 percent).

By a seven-point margin, McAuliffe is also viewed positively (43 percent favorable vs. 36 percent unfavorable), while President Trump is in negative territory by 15 (40-55 percent).

Fully 88 percent of voters who view Trump favorably back Gillespie, while 81 percent of those who have a negative view support Northam.

Interest in the election is a tad bit higher among Democrats, as 48 percent say they are extremely interested compared to 44 percent among Republicans.

Northam is favored by majorities of both those who are extremely interested (52 percent) as well as those who are certain of their vote choice (53 percent).

Conflict between neo-Nazi protesters and counter-protesters on August 12 led to deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Confederate monuments and statues were a campaign issue in the wake of that conflict.

A 60 percent majority of Virginia voters agrees with Gillespie that Confederate monuments should remain in place. However, that isn’t the decisive factor for his voters, as just 64 percent of those wanting the monuments to stay up support Gillespie. By comparison, 92 percent of those wanting them to be taken down favor Northam.

Nearly half of Virginia voters live in a gun-owner household. They back Gillespie by 23 points, while Northam has a larger 38-point advantage among non-gun owners.

A tight race is hardly a surprise, as the Old Dominion State has been a swing state in recent years. Even so, Democrats have been on a bit of a roll. Hillary Clinton won Virginia in the 2016 presidential election, and Barack Obama won the state in both 2012 and 2008.

The company we trusted to handle our credit scores has become a pariah of the financial world since it allowed hackers to steal vital information from 145 million American adults.

I’m one of them. You probably are too. Click here to check if your personal data was exposed in the Equifax data breach.

How much information was stolen? Let’s start with the basics: Your name, Social Security number and birthdate. That alone is a treasure trove for identity thieves. But they also may have your address and driver’s license number. These people know where you live. They can find out almost anything about you. The list of nefarious things they can do is beyond comprehension.

An example? Click here to learn how the Equifax breach lets ID thieves have surgery on your dime.

Here’s my best advice: Assume the worst. The hackers have your information, and Equifax can’t do anything to protect you. Law enforcement is too overwhelmed to find the culprits, and you are completely exposed.

Here’s what to do next.

Establish two-factor authentication

If you work at a modern business or organization, you’re probably familiar with this process already. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step to the login process of your most critical accounts. When a website asks for your user name and password, you may also receive a text message or an email with a special code. This is a standard practice and is considered safe.

The idea is that even though hackers may have figured out your credentials, they won't be able to access your account without the special code. Cybercriminals would have to nab your physical cellphone, which is probably protected by a passcode, as well. Using this system makes the task much too complicated, especially when many hackers are located in other countries.

Who allows 2FA?

Several websites and email providers already offer 2FA to help protect accounts. The problem is that these sites and providers don’t seem to promote these extra security measures. It’s up to users to figure it out.

Use Amazon, Google or Facebook? How about Apple or Microsoft? All offer 2FA protection, but only if you take a few minutes to set it up. Click here for the steps you need to take now to lock down your accounts.

But what about banks? Incredibly, not all banks support two-factor authentication. Given recent events, I expect this to change. In the meantime, you’ll have to check and see if your online banking permits 2FA. If it does, sign up for it right away.

You can usually set up two-factor authentication either on your online banking account page or within the bank’s official app. Here are the links to some of the more popular banks or financial institutions' two-factor authentication setup pages:

· Bank of America

· Capital One

· Discover

· USAA

· Wells Fargo

If your bank is not on the list, call or visit it.

Prevent identity theft

OK, you’ve done your best to secure your accounts and made it hard for hackers to break into your bank or email. But remember, the Equifax hack happened last spring. Cybercriminals have had plenty of time to steal your identity. So what can you do to keep them from finishing the job?

Try executing a “credit freeze,” more accurately known as a “security freeze.” The name may sound strange, almost like sabotaging your own finances, but it’s a common defensive maneuver. If you suspect someone is already pretending to be you, you can lock your credit reports so that no one can open a new account in your name.

How does this work? Lenders consult your credit score before they start a partnership with you. If lenders can’t check those scores, no new accounts can be established.

Click here to learn more about how to set up a security freeze.

The most important thing is not to wait. Hackers move quickly, and this is their fulltime job. If they can steal your identity and bank account, they will, and as expediently as possible. Equifax made one of the biggest blunders in banking history. Now it’s up to us to clean up the mess.

""CMA apologizes for the recently distributed restrictions in the CMA Awards media guidelines, which have since been lifted. The sentiment was not to infringe and was created with the best of intentions to honor and celebrate Country Music,"" the organization in a statement.

The new regulations were designed to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas and other political topics.

The statement comes following a backlash by artists, including from the co-host for the awards show, Brad Paisley.

""I'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. In 3...2....1.....,"" Paisley tweeted Friday.

After the decision was reversed Paisley tweeted, ""Bravo CMA awards for doing the right thing & apologizing for this mistake. All are welcome, let's have a great show.""

The CMA's original statement was as follows:

“In light of recent events, and out of respect for the artists directly or indirectly involved, please refrain from focusing your coverage of the CMA Awards Red Carpet and Backstage Media Center on the Las Vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like,” read the guidelines provided to Fox News.

“It’s vital, more so this year than in years past due to the sensitivities at hand, that the CMA Awards be a celebration of Country Music and the artists that make this genre so great. It’s an evening to honor the outstanding achievements in Country Music of the previous year and we want everyone to feel comfortable talking to press about this exciting time.”

A representative for the CMAs noted to Fox News that “all outlets must agree for access” to the event. The 51st Annual CMA Awards are scheduled to take place in Nashville, Tennessee on November 8.

At a media preview Thursday in New York City, with hosts Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley, The Associated Press asked the performers about the Vegas shooting. The stars said they want to honor the victims’ families during the show.

The world of country music has been in unique and unfamiliar territory of late following the tragedy in Las Vegas at a Jason Aldean concert that left nearly 60 people dead. Additionally, one of the genre's most popular publicists, Kirt Webster, is embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.

“Donna Brazile going off the reservation right now is bad for Democrats,” Republican strategist Rory McShane told Fox News on Sunday.
“But we’ve seen this before in off-year elections like in Georgia and South Carolina, where Democrats believed they’d win.","Donna Brazile's scathing review of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign sent more shock waves this weekend through the Democratic Party, with members eager to bury the Clinton era ahead of Tuesday’s key Virginia governor’s race and other upcoming elections.

“Those telling me to shut up … I tell them, 'Go to hell.' I’m gonna tell my story,” Brazile, who ran the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 White House race, on Sunday told ABC’s “This Week.”

Brazile roiled the political world on Thursday when she published excerpts in Politico of her upcoming book that detailed a 2015 money deal between the Clinton campaign and the DNC that made winning the party’s presidential nomination nearly impossible for any other Democratic candidate.

NBC News published a memorandum Saturday detailing the joint-fundraising agreement that shows the Clinton camp would have input on such key DNC decisions as hiring and spending, in exchange for helping the group with its roughly $20 million debt.

The memo also made clear that other potential candidates could enter into a similar agreement with the DNC.

But Brazile suggested Sunday that the authority the Clinton camp had under the agreement went beyond “standard” joint-fundraising agreements and that a “separate,” undisclosed deal also existed.

“I could not control the purse strings of the Democratic Party,” she said. “I become chair, and I'm trying to write a check for something that I raised money (for.) And they're like, 'You have to get that signed off on from Brooklyn.' This wasn’t a standard joint fundraising agreement. … They had separate memo of understanding.”

A review Saturday by The Washington Post of the book -- “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House” -- resulted in former Clinton campaign staffers penning an open letter, disputing Brazile’s accusations that the campaign was tone-deaf to middle-class voters, acted with a false sense of “inevitability” and in the closing weeks had “the odor of failure.”

According to the review, Brazile, who is African-American, also said she felt the campaign treated her like a “slave” and that she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden, after Clinton passed out during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York City.

“We were shocked to learn the news that Donna Brazile actively considered overturning the will of the Democratic voters by attempting to replace Hillary Clinton,” campaign members, including Robby Mook, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, in part said in the letter. “We are pretty tired of people who were not part of our campaign telling the world what it was like to be on the inside.”

To be sure, the scathing criticism of one long-standing Democrat on other members of her own party comes at a bad time -- days away from the Virginia gubernatorial race featuring Republican Ed Gillespie against Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.

The RealClearPolitics polls average shows Northam now leading by 3 percentage points, essentially a dead heat, after leading by nearly 7 points just weeks ago.

“Donna Brazile going off the reservation right now is bad for Democrats,” Republican strategist Rory McShane told Fox News on Sunday. “But we’ve seen this before in off-year elections like in Georgia and South Carolina, where Democrats believed they’d win. This is just the latest case of no message, no organization, no leadership.”

Tom Perez, the new DNC chairman, on Saturday, after The Post review of Brazile’s book, rushed to assure Democrats that he would clean up the group’s mess ahead of the next presidential election cycle.

“While we’ve made remarkable progress since last November, we still have a long way to go,” he said in a statement. “I am more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. That is unacceptable. To that end, the new DNC under my leadership is committed to the task of making sure that our 2020 nominating process will be unquestionably fair and transparent.”

Liz Smith, who was a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, another 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, on Saturday told Fox News’ “America’s News Headquarters”: “I know Donald Trump and Republicans would like to use Hillary Clinton as a whipping boy. But she’s in our past. We are moving beyond her.”","Shocking Brazile expose drives Hillary camp into chaos, may throw key Virginia governor race to GOP",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/05/shocking-donna-brazile-expose-drives-hillary-camp-into-chaos-may-throw-crucial-virginia-governor-race-to-gop.html

Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

Following Outnumbered Overtime, Perino will host The Daily Briefing at 2PM/ET, an hour often dominated by breaking news, White House press briefings, and more from Washington and around the nation. With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

“How bloody pompous! It’s a compliment to the chef the fact that customers want to take a pictures of dishes they’ve paid for,” argued Ramsay in a series of Twitter posts that have since gone viral.

GORDON RAMSAY BLASTS JAMIE OLIVER OVER COMMENT ABOUT HIS FAMILY, DEMANDS APOLOGY

The “Hell’s Kitchen” host was responding to reports of a new edict from the people behind the famed Waterside Inn in Berkshire, one of only four restaurants in all of England to boast three Michelin stars. Late last month, the restaurant had put up a sign instructing diners to refrain from taking pictures of their dishes — a practice which deeply irks one of the restaurant’s founders.

“I’m really getting so upset about people taking pictures. We put up a card at the door — ‘No photos, please,’” Michel Roux, who co-founded the Waterside Inn with his brother Albert, told the Daily Mail when the sign went up.

“What are they doing?” he added. “Maybe once during the meal you want to take a little photo of something because it’s unusual. But what about the flavors? A picture on a phone cannot possibly capture the flavors.”

But Ramsay, who owns one of the few other three-starred Michelin restaurants in England, was extremely critical of the Waterside’s decision, arguing that food photography was a form of free advertising. In another tweet, he suggested that Roux, 76, was an “old fart” who refused to keep up with the times.

Ramsay further pointed out that the social media teams at UK’s Michelin Guide post pictures of their dining experiences, calling it “a breath of fresh air.”

GORDON RAMSAY REALLY HATES THESE THREE AMERICAN FOODS

The outspoken chef then continued to respond to Twitter followers who agreed with his sentiments, and ultimately hinted that Roux, whose son now runs the dining room at the Waterside, had forgotten that “customers are king.”

Hundreds of Ramsay’s other followers echoed his feelings about food photography, with many arguing that patron should be able to snap pics the meals they’re paying for. Only a scant few admitted that they, or someone they know, might find the practice annoying.

The Telegraph, meanwhile, has pointed out that the Roux family’s other Michelin-starred restaurant in London — Le Gavroche — isn’t as strict with its photography rules.

Albert Roux’s own son, Michel Roux Jr., serves as the chef at the London hotspot, and once stated that he doesn’t really care if people take photos of his food.

“If someone’s phone goes off, we look at them as if to say, ‘Switch that off or it goes in the ice bucket,’” said Michel Jr., according to the Telegraph. “I don’t mind people taking pictures. I’ve been known to do it myself.”

FOX NEWS - Rand Paul was recovering Sunday from five broken ribs, including three displaced fractures, after he was assaulted by a neighbor who tackled him from behind at the senator’s Kentucky home, officials said.

Senior Adviser Doug Stafford said it is unclear when the Republican senator will return to work since he is in “considerable pain” and has difficulty getting around, including flying. Stafford said this type of injury is marked by severe pain that can last for weeks to months.

“This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force,” Stafford said a statement to Fox News.

The Bowling Green Daily News reported that an arrest warrant said Paul told police his neighbor came on his property and tackled him from behind Friday, forcing him to the ground, all while the senator had been mowing his lawn. He had trouble breathing because of the rib injury, the warrant said.

Langendorff said he arrived at an intersection near the church. He said he witnessed Kelley and the other man engaged in a gun battle and recognized one of the men from the community.

""I pulled up on the intersection and I saw the shooter coming from the cars, actually right outside the church his vehicle was parked, doors open, engines open and him and the neighbor across the street and exchanging fire,"" he said.

The man posted on Facebook about a photo the restaurant had up that he believed to be an image of two white people in blackface.

Since the post, the man's claims went viral and people on social media called to boycott the restaurant and some made extreme threats which prompted police to respond, News channel 3 reports.

“We got a phone call saying they were going to come down here rioting and they were going to come in here and wreak havoc,” owner Sandy Bloomfield said.

TRUMP HOTEL SKEWERED BY TWITTER FOR STEAK PHOTOS

However, Bloomfield explains there is a much different story for the photo, which “has been on the wall for six years,” she says.

After the unexpected backlash, Bloomfield posted the original color version of the photo on Facebook, which shows two employees dressed up as members of the Blue Man Group for Halloween in 2009.

Bloomfield, who has owned Julianna’s Restaurant in Kalamazoo for nearly 30 years, said the restaurant’s aesthetic is all black and white, which is why the original blue photo isn’t the one hung up.

“All the décor in the restaurant is in black and white,” Bloomfield told News channel 3.

“Clearly, it's the blue man group,” Bloomfield said.

Since the social media firestorm, Juliana’s Restaurant issued a statement, which further caught flack for being “sarcastic,” Strick Strickland, Kalamazoo’s NAACP chapter president told the news outlet.

On social media, the restaurant posted, “After this stunt, blue people will be given one free meal as an apology for the photo.""

Of the response, Strickland said, “I think that says I don't take how others feels seriously, and I think they should,” Strickland said.

Bloomfield said she thought the restaurant’s response “might not have been the best,” but was “what they could do to protect the business.”

Both Strickland and Bloomfield do agree that the situation can serve as a learning opportunity for members in the community.

Strickland wants people to “try and educate one another"" after incidents like these.

Bloomfield hopes for a similarly interactive approach where people would ask questions rather than immediately posting their assumptions on social media.

“I hope that people, when people see something, they can ask instead of jumping to conclusions,” Bloomfield said.

The 93-year-old soon realized a freight train was barreling toward him.

“It was literally about one or two minutes before he was pulled out of the car that the train came,” Grant said. “It was definitely a miracle that he was pulled out in time, and definitely a miracle for me as well that I didn’t get my car damaged.”

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue transported the 93-year-old to an area hospital, where he was evaluated and released, according to WSVN.

Flescher, who survived internment at multiple concentration camps during World War II and shared his experience in 2016 in a heartbreaking Reddit AMA, thanked those who came to his rescue.

MCDONALD’S SINGAPORE'S NEW ‘NASI LEMAK’ BURGER IRKS SOME, COMPLETELY SELLS OUT ANYWAY

According to the BBC, nasi lemak, which means “fatty rice” in Malay, is “coconut milk-infused rice accompanied by various ingredients — the standard ones are a fried egg, cucumber slices, tiny fried anchovies, peanuts, and a hefty dollop of sambal, or spice paste.” It’s typically wrapped in banana leaves and often eaten for breakfast.

The gown, however, required much more preparation than the dish: Designed by Malaysian designer Brian Khoo, the dress reportedly took more than 400 hours to complete. Khoo used hand-embroidered rhinestones to represent grains of rice, red rhinestones for the spicy sambal, and a pair of ""wings"" that represent banana leaves. The outfit also includes added embellishments representing peanuts, cucumbers and a fried egg, The Malay Mail Online reports.

Organizers describe it as a ""feast for the eyes and the senses, mmm!"" according to the BBC.

James added that she ""loves nasi lemak"" and eats it ""all the time,” according to Channel news Asia. “It represents me and my country.""

Prince Alwaleed is accused of money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, an official told Reuters on Sunday.
The billionaire is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Co., which lost 7.5 percent in trading Sunday.
Kingdom Holding does not currently own significant stakes in 21st Century Fox.
Alwaleed is known to have invested through his fund, Kingdom Holding, in Apple, Lyft, Twitter and other high-profile companies.","One of the world's richest men, who's been the longtime face of Saudi Arabia's outreach to the west, remained locked up in a 5-star hotel Monday, following a weekend shakeup of the Kingdom's royal family.

The reshuffling occurred as Saudi King Salman swore in new officials to replace those arrested in the sweeping anti-corruption probe.

Billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is a nephew of the king and is worth an estimated $18 billion, is reportedly being held up at the country's Ritz Carlton in Riyad, along with 10 other princes and 38 officials. Rumors swirled the royals were receiving five-star accommodations when the luxury hotel was evacuated Saturday, The New York Times reported. An airport for private planes was also closed, possibly to prevent businessmen from fleeing via the airport.

The arrests that began late Saturday included Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who for the past four years had led the National Guard, and Adel Fakeih, who was minister of economy since April. They were reportedly arrested in a purported anti-corruption probe led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Prince Miteb was once considered a contender for the throne, though he has not been thought of recently as a challenger to Prince Mohammed.

Prince Alwaleed is accused of money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, an official told Reuters on Sunday.

The major purge came hours before Senior Saudi Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the deputy governor of Asir Province, and seven other officials were killed in a helicopter crash near Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen, BBC reported, citing state media. It’s unclear what caused the crash. Prince Mansour, the son of Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, was returning from an inspection tour Sunday night.

Investors were left shaken after Prince Alwaleed’s arrest. The billionaire is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Co., which lost 7.5 percent in trading Sunday. The company made no reference to its chairman's arrest, but on Monday said in a statement it has the government's ""vote of confidence"" as it pursues its investment strategy and global business operations.

As of 2016, Alwaleed held a five-percent stake in 21st Century Fox, Fox News’ parent company. Kingdom Holding does not currently own significant stakes in 21st Century Fox. Alwaleed is known to have invested through his fund, Kingdom Holding, in Apple, Lyft, Twitter and other high-profile companies. Kingdom Holding manages more than $12.5 billion of investments around the world.

CEO Talal al-Maiman said the company is focused on its ""unwavering responsibilities"" to shareholders.

The official Saudi Press Agency released images of the king on Monday swearing in new National Guard chief Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin and new Economy and Planning Minister Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.

The king was also pictured meeting Lebanon's outgoing Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, who unexpectedly resigned during a trip to Saudi Arabia. The photos of their meeting did little to quiet speculation over his surprising move and current status. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, Hariri's top political rival at home, argued on Sunday that Saudi Arabia had forced Hariri to resign amid the deepening Saudi-Iran rivalry and questioned whether Saudi Arabia had also detained him in the sweep.

The Saudi government has not confirmed those arrested or named those who were detained. A statement by the attorney general's office said no assets of any suspects have yet been frozen. Saudi Twitter accounts released several other names of those arrested, including Alwalid al-Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman with ties to the royal family who runs the Arabic satellite group MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, the former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Ibrahim Assaf, a former finance minister, and Bakr Binladin, head of the Saudi Binladin Group, a major business conglomerate.

Before Prince Harry entered her life, Markle was often spotted rocking mini dresses, skirts and shorts, looks she’s largely seemed to phase out of her wardrobe since making things public with the fifth in line to the throne.

Since then, she’s looked equally comfortable in floor-length gowns on the red carpet and chic button-down-and-jeans ensembles alike.

On Sunday, in the midst of news coming out about the situation in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the 45-year-old star responded to House speaker Paul Ryan’s note of condolence on Twitter.

“Reports out of Texas are devastating. The people of Sutherland Springs need our prayers right now,” Ryan wrote.

“The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they’d still be alive, you worthless sack of sh--,” the star wrote in a reply tweet.

Many fans were immediately upset at Wheaton's flippant response to the tweet, arguing that he dismissed prayer and those with faith far too easily.

“Seriously? So this sicko kills people in a church and somehow it’s Gods fault? Or prayer? You have an interesting perspective. No hate,” one said.

“One thing to attack a politician, it’s another to attack the innocent dead and all religion. Looks like you’re the worthless sack of sh--,” another wrote.

The backlash caused the actor to produce a series of tweets explaining his comments and apologizing to any people of faith that were offended.

“I’m not talking about religion or faith at all. I am talking about the speaker of the house who does nothing to address gun violence,” he replied. “Hey, real and actual people of faith: I hear you.

With just under 5 minutes remaining in a Friday night win over the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks center Kristaps Porzingis raced back on defense for an emphatic block of a shot by Suns rookie Josh Jackson, then raced forward on offense to execute a powerful dunk – and even draw a foul in the process.

""M-V-P! M-V-P!"" rang the chants from the Garden crowd.

Porzingis ended the game with 37 points as New York topped Phoenix, 120-107.

That was just one point shy of the career-high 38 that Porzingis scored just four nights earlier in a win against the Denver Nuggets. And it was his sixth 30-point performance in eight games this season for the 4-4 Knicks.

In other words, Porzingis has been getting the message out across the NBA:

A young star is becoming an even bigger star.

Just months ago, the Knicks seemed to be a team in disarray. Team president and failed messiah Phil Jackson had been jettisoned after an unexpectedly rocky tenure with the club, and hometown favorite player Carmelo Anthony had been shipped off to the Oklahoma City Thunder after nearly seven seasons in New York.

With the marquee names gone, the team was now in the hands of Porzingis, the 7-foot-3, 22-year-old import from Latvia whose arrival in New York via the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft initially drew groans from fans and the humbling question, “Who?”

But these days Porzingis No. 6 jerseys are an increasingly familiar sight around the streets of Gotham, beginning to replace the fraying No. 7 jerseys with Anthony’s name. (Last season, Forbes ranked Porzingis' jersey as the seventh-best seller, while Anthony's ranked 15th.)

Porzingis is now undeniably the face of the Knicks – and it’s a role he seems to relish. He even appears to enjoy razzing the cross-town rival Brooklyn Nets and their fans.

“Sometimes I see somebody with a Brooklyn hat on, I say, ‘What is that? You need a Knicks hat,’” Porzingis told the New York Daily News in 2015.

But Porzingis’ desire to stay in New York was recently called into question when a Latvian magazine published some comments by his brother, Janis Porzingis, who works for the firm that represents the Knick.

Janis Porzingis cited his brother's dissatisfaction with the Knicks last season, when he skipped his exit interview, and noted that Kristaps would need to be happy to re-sign with the team in the future, even if leaving meant taking less money.

But Kristaps said much of the comments were taken out of context and that fans shouldn't be concerned.

""I think the fans know I'm here in New York, I love New York and I see myself as a Knick for a long, long time,” Porzingis said.

“I don't think they should be worried about it.""

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

FAMILY SEES HOPE IN GENE THERAPY FOR SON DIAGNOSED WITH FATAL NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form. My heart aches with joy with the people standing behind Supergirl on this fight. She’s fought to be alive since her first breath, but that’s all she knows. I love the idea of sharing the beautiful story that is her and Hunter. Most people wait a lifetime for someone who wouldn’t stand by them through such illness.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

The 56-year-old actor told The Sunday Times Hollywood isn’t a priority for him anymore.

“Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I’m 56,” explained Clooney. “I’m not the guy that gets the girl anymore. I shouldn’t be the guy that gets the girl.”

However, there’s a more obvious reason why the father of 5-month-old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting.

“[But], look, if somebody’s got Paul Newman in ‘The Verdict,’ I’d jump,” he said. “But there aren’t that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f-----g dollars. I don’t need money.”

Back in June, Clooney confirmed that he and his business partners – nightlife businessman Rande Gerber and real estate mogul Mike Meldeman – sold their tequila company Casamigos for $1 billion.

“I have money,” said Clooney. “So I can fight to make movies I want to make. If you look at what I’ve been in over the past 15 years, for the most part they weren’t going to get made if I didn’t do them. Nobody was going to make ‘Good Night, and Good Luck,’ ‘Michael Clayton’ or ‘Up in the Air,’ and I fought to get those out there.”

Clooney admitted the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he’s not ready to tackle that role.

“So many people since Trump were elected [and] have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,” he explained. “I don’t have political aspirations.”

He added, “I have always been involved in politics. My father ran for Congress. It’s been in our family forever. But, mostly, I can help in ways I actually know very well, like messaging [voters].”",George Clooney explains why he's taking a break from acting: 'I don't need money',http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/06/george-clooney-explains-why-hes-taking-break-from-acting-dont-need-money.html

That's the experience of countless people convinced they are suffering from a real illness—such as singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who believes she has Morgellons disease, a questionable condition that makes people feel “fibers” or other objects poking out of their skin. With the recent release of the new book, Reckless Daughter: A Portrait of Joni Mitchell, her mysterious illness is once again in the spotlight.

You don’t have to look hard to find other accounts of Morgellons or similar illnesses that often get the side eye from doctors. But you do have to look hard for any medical or scientific evidence that these and other conditions truly exist. As a result, many sufferers are left with few options for treatment of real symptoms that can’t be explained. Here are 7 of these baffling conditions, and the cases for and against them.

Morgellons disease

The symptoms Mitchell described to the LA Times in 2010 sound agonizing: “Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm: They cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable, or mineral. Morgellons is a slow, unpredictable killer—a terrorist disease: It will blow up one of your organs, leaving you in bed for a year.”

But when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tried to determine what causes such symptoms in the approximately four out of every 100,000 people who experience them, researchers were stumped. “No common underlying medical condition or infectious source was identified, similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation,"" study authors concluded in 2012.

CAN HOLDING IN A SNEEZE KILL YOU?

Indeed, Morgellons is often chocked up to delusions: Perhaps sufferers are actually dealing with a mental illness that conjures up feelings of being infected by parasites, called delusional parasitosis, which might account for the creepy-crawly sensations that people say they experience with Morgellons.

Chronic Lyme disease

This term is sometimes used to describe patients who have lingering symptoms of actual Lyme disease, something that occurs in up to 20 percent of Lyme cases. However, some doctors diagnose patients with something dubbed chronic Lyme disease when they were never infected with this tick-borne illness in the first place, yet they have unexplained Lyme–like symptoms including joint pain, fatigue, and muscle aches.

Chronic Lyme disease is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and there’s no evidence that treating it—usually with long courses of IV antibiotics— helps alleviate symptoms. The doctors who offer such treatments ""don’t typically follow the most commonly recommended treatments and the evidence-based guidelines,” Christina Nelson, MD, medical epidemiologist for the CDC told Health previously. “Most general practitioners and infectious disease physicians would not provide this type of care.”

Adrenal fatigue

Exhaustion, body aches, trouble sleeping, and undereye bags have lately been attributed to adrenal fatigue, but there’s no evidence that’s a thing. First described in 1998, the illness supposedly is based around the idea that the adrenal glands—which produce hormones that control metabolism and fight stress and are situated near the kidneys—stop working properly when the body is overtaxed by stress or illness.

Still, there’s no actual proof that taxing the body wears out the adrenal glands, and blaming symptoms on adrenal fatigue could delay treatment for what’s really wrong. ""Symptoms of fatigue, body aches, trouble sleeping, indigestion, and nervousness are nonspecific and could be due to a variety of other diseases, including sleep disorders, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and thyroid disease,"" Marilyn Tan, MD, an endocrinologist with Stanford Health Care and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford School of Medicine told Health previously. ""To attribute all symptoms to a single diagnosis of 'adrenal fatigue' risks missing the detection of other treatable underlying diseases.""

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity

Sometimes jokingly referred to by skeptics as ""Wi-Fi allergies,"" EHS is supposedly triggered after a person is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, which comes from computers, cell phones, and other electronics. It's associated with fatigue, nausea, and heart palpitations. While the symptoms themselves are legit, there’s little evidence they’re actually caused by, say, sleeping in the same room as a Wi-Fi router. “Some research suggests that the physical complaints may be caused by fear and anxiety about having this condition—not the actual radiation,” Health’s medical editor Roshini Raj, MD, wrote previously.

Wind turbine syndrome

People thought to have wind turbine syndrome experience a range of general symptoms, like dizziness, nausea, trouble sleeping or breathing, and headaches. The one common denominator, sufferers insist, is that these health issues started when they began living near wind turbines—the large windmill-like contraptions that convert wind into energy and emit low-frequency sound waves.

FDA WARNS ON 'POT CURES CANCER' CLAIMS

First identified by pediatrician Nina Pierpont, WTS has gained the support of a handful of doctors who contribute opinions and anecdotal accounts of the syndrome to Dr. Pierpont’s website. So far, however, lab studies of those low-frequency noises, called infrasound, have been inconclusive. Dr. Pierpont has conducted just one study on the topic, which was small, done over the phone, and did not undergo peer review, Popular Science reported in October 2013.

Multiple chemical sensitivity

Lots of chemicals have been proven to be harmful to your health, like tobacco smoke and asbestos. And recent research suggests that exposure to certain everyday chemicals can increase your cancer risk later in life. But people who believe they have MCS say low levels of chemicals found in detergent, soap, ink, and other products has triggered chronic fatigue, memory problems, headaches, and rashes, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Often, these symptoms occur after a more severe but short-term chemical exposure, like a chemical spill.

“Multiple chemical sensitivity is under debate in the medical community at this time,” according to Johns Hopkins. “Some healthcare providers question whether it exists. Others acknowledge it as a medical disorder triggered by exposures to chemicals in the environment.”

Wilson’s syndrome

Also called Wilson’s temperature syndrome, this condition is supposedly a mild form of hypothyroidism, triggering a variety of symptoms attributed to thyroid dysfunction, such as a low body temperature. But when people who believe they have Wilson's undergo thyroid testing, their thyroid hormone levels are normal.

A doctor named E. Denis Wilson named this syndrome after himself and says it can be treated with a special thyroid hormone preparation. But the American Thyroid Association is not convinced. “The American Thyroid Association has found no scientific evidence supporting the existence of 'Wilson’s syndrome,'"" according to a statement. “The theory proposed to explain this condition is at odds with established facts about thyroid hormone.""
