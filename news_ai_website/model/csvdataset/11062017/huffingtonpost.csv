The agency said it's invested $1 billion to tackle the problem and currently has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations underway related to offshore tax havens.
And last year, it levied more than $44 million in penalties on tax advisers who facilitated non-compliance with Canadian tax laws.

Any suggestion of ""false documentation, fraud, 'disguised' conduct, tax evasion or similar conduct is false,'' Brock added.","OTTAWA — The Canada Revenue Agency says it won't hesitate to investigate new evidence of offshore tax evasion in the wake of a second massive leak of tax haven financial records.

The leak of some 13.4 million records, dubbed the Paradise Papers, lifts another veil on the often murky ways in which the wealthy — including more than 3,000 Canadian individuals and entities — stash their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes.

Among the names that pop up in the records with some connection to offshore accounts are former Canadian prime ministers Brian Mulroney, Paul Martin and Jean Chretien, the Queen, U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and the past and current chief fundraisers for the federal Liberal party.

Neither the CRA nor any court has determined the Canadians did anything wrong.

Former prime minister Brian Mulroney leaves a Liberal cabinet meeting in Ottawa on April 6, 2017.

Offshore accounts are used by wealthy individuals and corporations around the world as a perfectly legal way to reduce their tax burden, although the anonymity provided to account holders has also led to associations with tax evasion, money laundering and organized crime.

The Paradise Papers were obtained by German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including CBC/Radio Canada and the Toronto Star which published details on Sunday.

The media outlets did not disclose how they acquired the documents, which consist primarily of client records of offshore law firm Appleby, as well as some records from offshore corporate services firms Estera and Asiaciti Trust.

CRA says 42 criminal investigations are ongoing

In an apparent attempt to pre-empt the news reports, the CRA issued a statement last Friday, detailing the agency's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance, which intensified following the first huge leak of tax-haven records, known as the Panama Papers, in April 2016.

The agency said it's invested $1 billion to tackle the problem and currently has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations underway related to offshore tax havens.

As a result of audits over the last two years, the CRA said it identified some $25 billion in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. And last year, it levied more than $44 million in penalties on tax advisers who facilitated non-compliance with Canadian tax laws.

The agency said it's also working closely with 36 other countries in the Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration on more effective ways to detect and deal with tax evasion and avoidance.

A sign is pictured in front of the Canada Revenue Agency national headquarters in Ottawa on March 13, 2017.

Evidently anticipating Sunday's release of the Paradise Papers, the CRA promised to do more should new details of questionable practices emerge.

""In the event that further details come to light, CRA will not hesitate to investigate and take further action as warranted,'' the agency said.

""The government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as other tax administrations and all other partners, to ensure a tax system that works for Canadians. In addition, the CRA will continue to build on its capacity to detect and crack down on tax cheats and ensure that those who choose to break the law face the consequences and are held accountable for their actions.''

A spokesman for National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier, said on Sunday that ""the CRA is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take appropriate action in regards to the Paradise Papers.''

Tax avoidance measures involving offshore trusts are legal, provided that the trust is genuinely managed offshore and that Canadian taxes are paid on any Canadian contributions.

According to the Toronto Star and CBC/Radio Canada, the records suggest that Stephen Bronfman and his family's Montreal-based investment company, Claridge Inc., were linked to an offshore trust in the Cayman Islands that may have used questionable means to avoid paying millions in taxes.

Bronfman is a close friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tapped him in 2013 to fill the role of revenue chair — effectively, the chief fundraiser — for the federal Liberal party.

Stephen Bronfman attends the Liberal party's caucus retreat in Georgetown, P.E.I. on Aug. 28, 2013.

The offshore trust also involved former chief Liberal fundraiser and senator Leo Kolber and his son, Jonathan Kolber.

William Brock, a lawyer for Bronfman and Jonathan Kolber, denied any impropriety, telling the CBC that his clients ""have always acted properly and ethically, including fully complying with all applicable laws.'' Any suggestion of ""false documentation, fraud, 'disguised' conduct, tax evasion or similar conduct is false,'' Brock added.

The Prime Minister's Office referred questions about Bronfman to the Liberal party.

Party spokesman Braeden Caley said Bronfman's role is strictly a volunteer position devoted to fundraising, ""not policy decisions.'' The revenue chair is a ""non-voting position'' on the party's national board, Caley added.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer issued a statement on Sunday accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of failing to crack down on ""tax avoidance schemes used by his wealthy friends.''

""Justin Trudeau's well-connected Liberal friends get away with paying less, and you pay more. There is nothing fair about that,'' the statement said.

As NARAL pointed out in their tweet, Allen’s agenda essentially ensures that women serve as incubators of future laborers rather than independent and autonomous members of society.

Despite audible groans from other participating lawmakers, and plenty of impassioned responses to Allen’s comments on Twitter, the bill, which would allow abortion coverage in state insurance plans only in the case of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s life, passed in the state Assembly on Thursday.

Wisconsin lawmakers had attempted to pass the bill in 2013, but it was ultimately killed. It passed by a wide majority this time around, at 61-35 votes, and will now move to the state Senate.

In a statement on Thursday, Nicole Safar, the executive director of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said that “women in Wisconsin should not be subject to these continued attempts to roll back insurance coverage based solely on a few legislators’ political agenda.”

“If this policy becomes law, families in Wisconsin will have to pay the full cost of an unexpected medical emergency out of pocket,” Safar said.",Wisconsin Rep Says Abortion Access Is Bad For Labor Force,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-rep-says-abortion-access-is-bad-for-labor-force_us_5a006d6fe4b04cdbeb34d94c?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

PhotoIn his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.","Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads, and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign.

No one has suggested that Mr. Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation. For his part, Mr. Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world.

A Russian Billionaire Investor’s Stake in American Technology Companies The Kremlin controls Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank. Gazprom Investholding lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Kanton Services. Kanton Services owned DST USA II, which was used to invest in Facebook. VTB Bank gave $191 million to DST Investments 3 for its stake in Twitter. The venture capitalist Yuri Milner founded DST Global, which managed DST USA II and DST Investments 3.

Even so, his use of the state-directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America’s technology giants.

“Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind — not just commercial interests but state interests as well,” said Michael Carpenter, the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. “They go hand in hand.”

Mr. Carpenter added, “Oligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia’s crony capitalist system.”

There is nothing illegal about foreign state-owned institutions investing in American companies. VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments, not motivated by political considerations.

As Mr. Milner sees it, the story is similarly simple — “nothing more than business,” he said, adding: “We are getting money, and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter. We are making money for our limited partners, and we are giving money back to them. For me, it’s a commercial arrangement.”

(A statement from DST Global, Mr. Milner’s venture capital firm, appears here.)

The Path to Silicon Valley

Mr. Milner, 55, studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States, where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington.

He returned to Russia and in the late 1990s and worked as an executive at Bank Menatep, which was founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil tycoon who was stripped of his company, prosecuted and imprisoned after a televised confrontation with President Vladimir V. Putin.

Mr. Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov — an Uzbek-Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev — and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail.ru, a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange.

Mr. Milner’s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr. Medvedev, who was Russia’s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast, famously touring Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with Steve Jobs.

In May 2009, Facebook announced an investment of roughly $200 million by Mr. Milner’s company, Digital Sky Technologies, and said the company planned to spend at least $100 million buying additional stock. Eventually, Mr. Milner’s new venture capital firm, DST Global, also amassed a significant stake in Facebook.

“A number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said at the time.

The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well: a connection — through a succession of shell companies — to the Kremlin.

Ties to the Russian State

In those years, as part of its diplomatic “reset” with Moscow, the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry. Importing tech knowledge, the theory went, would ease Russia’s dependence on exporting oil and gas.

For the Facebook deal, it was Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas giant, that became the bridge. The company, a vital component of the Putin government, has employed its financial subsidiary, Gazprom Investholding, to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s.

Gazprom Investholding is “used for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin,” said Ilya Zaslavskiy, a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative, a project of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding’s parent, Gazprom, are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia’s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Over several years, Gazprom Investholding and a subsidiary made hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to a company called Kanton Services, according to records from the Panama Papers, the trove of leaked documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. Kanton, in turn, owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook. While it is unclear precisely when Kanton first received its stake in the DST entity, Kanton received $197 million of the Gazprom Investholding loans three months before Facebook announced its first deal with Mr. Milner, the records show.

Kanton, based in the British Virgin Islands, had numerous ties to Mr. Milner’s backer, Mr. Usmanov.

Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate, and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger, a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr. Usmanov’s main holding company, USM Holdings, according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers. And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr. Usmanov referred to Kanton as a “private investment company, (facebook and twitter).”

In the interviews, Mr. Milner said his investors’ identities were not generally public information. And he sought to distance his company from Mr. Usmanov. “I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us,” he said. What’s more, he said, Mr. Usmanov had many potential sources of financing, making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook.

Photo

To demonstrate this, Mr. Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like “Alleged Russian government funds,” “Mr. Usmanov” and “Facebook.” He pulled out a large bag of green M&M’s, filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M&M’s from one cup to another. “Money is fungible,” he explained, adding, “You can’t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook.”

A spokesman for Mr. Usmanov, Rollo Head, did not address specific questions. But in a statement, he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle. Mr. Usmanov, he said, “did not borrow from or use state or quasi-state funds to make investments in Facebook.”

Lucrative ‘Synergies’

The Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia’s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own, and their government’s, benefit: Even as he was investing in Facebook, Mr. Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding.

In fact, Mr. Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals, according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll. Kroll described those arrangements as “synergies.”

The Kroll report — a “reputation audit” — had been commissioned by Mr. Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr. Milner to invest in Facebook. Kroll investigators, relying on public records and interviews, detailed a long and colorful history: time in prison in Uzbekistan (he was later exonerated) and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures, according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times.

The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals — involving mining, media and technology companies, often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr. Medvedev. “Usmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the ‘most improved’ oligarch over the past eight years,” one source told Kroll.

Kroll investigators found that, for some investments, Mr. Usmanov turned to Kanton, the company that would be a part of Mr. Milner’s Facebook investment.

A Facebook spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST, calling it a “passive investor” and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago.

Gazprom Investholding called the loans “prudent,” saying they were “provided for general corporate purposes” at above-market rates. The company did not answer a question about what role, if any, Mr. Usmanov played in the loans, except to say that as its general director, he “operated in accordance” with the company’s charter.

To complete the Facebook deal, DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, according to the Panama Papers, United States securities filings and records from Appleby. DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers.

After the Facebook deal, Mr. Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley, spending about $100 million on a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing $7 billion in more than 30 companies, including Spotify, Airbnb and Groupon.

In interviews, he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests. Mr. Milner and Mr. Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly. Still, despite his company’s sizable stake, Mr. Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights.

At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco, Mr. Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash. “I think it’s actually the opposite,” he replied. “I sometimes get informal advice from them.”

Obscure Financial Maneuvers

Mr. Milner’s roughly $380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power: Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB.

Sixty-one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government. VTB’s president, Andrey L. Kostin, is a former Soviet diplomat; Matthias Warnig, on the bank’s supervisory council, is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr. Putin was stationed there with the K.G.B.

VTB has operations across the world, including in the United States. In recent years, it has been involved in a number of politically sensitive deals, including a loan that financed the Russian government’s murky privatization of 19.5 percent of the oil giant Rosneft.

Last year, the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin, a cellist and close friend of Mr. Putin. It was unknown what the money was for, but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders.

Mr. Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article, but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments. VTB called the account in the Panama Papers “unsubstantiated.”

“VTB is really a slush fund for Putin,” said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, and an early economic adviser to the post-Soviet Russian government. The bank, he added, is “the black cashier of the Putin crowd.”

Mr. Milner’s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities. But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB’s involvement.

In July 2011, VTB invested at least $191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3, corporate records show. That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global’s stake in Twitter that month. DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton, the company linked to Mr. Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal.

The Twitter deal had a notable feature: VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3, filings show. Kanton contributed almost none. It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.

On May 7, 2014 — six months after Twitter’s initial public offering, when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares — VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton. DST also cashed out its Twitter investment.

DST had one other investment from VTB, which Mr. Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund. VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD.com as recently as February 2015, when it transferred its stake to Kanton, Isle of Man records show.

In a statement, VTB said its involvement with Twitter was “solely a financial investment,” sold for a profit, one of several successful deals in the high-tech industry in that period. The bank added, “VTB is a solely commercial bank, we have never had any politically motivated deals.”

Twitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB, but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre-I.P.O. investors.

Mr. Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor, other than to say that the bank helped take Mail.ru public in 2010. According to the Kroll report, the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr. Usmanov. The report also details the close relationship between Mr. Usmanov and Mr. Medvedev, finding that Mr. Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia.

Beyond Social Media

Mr. Milner has also been active beyond Silicon Valley. He is a founder of the Breakthrough Prize, a series of lucrative scientific awards. And in July 2015, he was one of several high-profile investors in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother, Joshua. (Other investors and partners include Goldman Sachs, George Soros and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.)

Mr. Milner said he invested $850,000 in Cadre through a trust, which in turn controls DST Global Advisers, DST Global’s investment management firm. He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember. He said he met Jared Kushner only once, at a conference in Aspen, Colo.

Mr. Kushner and Cadre declined to comment.

In his interviews with The Times, Mr. Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter, his former major investments.

Growing up in the Soviet Union, he said, “if you’re a father and you have a conversation with your son, it’s easy to say, ‘Please don’t get involved in politics.’”

That “was my principle back then and still now,” he said, adding: “I prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy. And this is plenty for me.”",Kremlin Cash Behind Billionaire’s Twitter and Facebook Investments,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/05/kremlin-bank-funded-purchase-for-major-stakes-in-facebook-twitter_a_23267425/

Boochani was honoured through the Amnesty International Australia media awards for his writing in The Guardian and The Saturday Paper this past Wednesday.

Former community worker John Gilbert was one of those who turned out in the wet to protest.

Speaking to HuffPost Australia, the 67-year-old was appalled at ""the horrific, horrible, inhumane situation that our government has let happen"".



""From what I've seen with this present government, between this, and the Adani mine, and same-sex marriage and everything else, I despair"".

Two other protesters, Helen Esmond and Dorothy MacIntyre, said that they were at the rally as part of the Sydney chapter of the 'Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children' group.

The event was a way for the them to ""bring the whole situation to the awareness of the community,"" according to MacIntyre.

A rally was also held in Melbourne, where federal Greens member of parliament Adam Bandt said that the government needed a ""wake-up call"".



""We are being shamed in the eyes of the world because we are taking people who need our help and instead of holding an open hand we are hitting them with a closed fist and we are killing them. Enough is enough. We will stand up to you and say you are not doing this in our name, and you are not doing this for us"".

The protests come as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the situation on Manus Island on Saturday morning:



""We have serious concerns about the welfare, safety and wellbeing of the roughly 600 men who remain in the accommodation compound, who are too frightened to leave,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said.



""We call on the Australian Government, as the party who interned the men in the first place, to immediately provide protection, food, water and other basic services"".

Éric Vuillard a été récompensé par le prix Goncourt pour son roman ""L'ordre du jour"", Olivier Guez par prix Renaudot pour son livre ""La disparition de Josef Mengele"".

Ces deux livres, le premier publié en mai, le second en août, s'intéressent à un même thème: la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Si le récit-roman grinçant d'Éric Vuillard retrace les coulisses de la légende de l'Allemagne nazie, celui d'Olivier Guez raconte l'histoire vraie de la fuite en Amérique du Sud de Josef Mengele un médecin tortionnaire nazi.

Ce point commun a interpellé plusieurs commentateurs.

La seconde guerre, et plus particulièrement le nazisme, sont-ils le sujet de prédilection des prix littéraires? Pour répondre à cette question, nous avons d'abord choisi de nous concentrer sur les romans primés depuis 20 ans par les quatre prix littéraires les plus vendeurs de l'Hexagone: le Goncourt, le Renaudot, le Goncourt des lycéens et le prix Fémina. Parmi ceux-là, lesquels avaient pour sujet la guerre 39-45 puis la guerre tout court? Découvrez ci-dessous l'infographie regroupant nos résultats.

En observant les graphiques, on observe que le prix qui a récompensé le plus de livres traitant de la guerre 39-45 est le Goncourt des lycéens avec 4 romans sur 20. Un résultat qui s'explique sans doute par le jury de ce prix très apprécié des lecteurs. En effet, chaque année depuis 1988, environ 2000 lycéens votent pour leur livre préféré. La Seconde Guerre mondiale est au programme de ces élèves, de la seconde au BTS.

Si l'on regarde les chiffres des livres traitant de la guerre, en général, récompensés par ces quatre prix littéraires confondus lors des vingts dernières années, on observe que 17 ouvrages ont été primés sur les 80 ayant reçu un prix, soit près d'un quart.

C'est presque autant qu'un autre grand sujet de la littérature : les histoires d'amour. En vingt ans, le Goncourt a remis 4 prix à des romances, le Renaudot 2, le Goncourt des lycéens 4 et le prix Fémina 4.

Donald Trump hat seine Position bezüglich Nordkorea bekräftigt. Die Ära strategischer Geduld sei vorbei, sagte der US-Präsident.

""Wenn die Leute sagen, meine Rhetorik sei zu stark, sollten wir uns ansehen, wohin wir mit schwacher Rhetorik in den vergangenen 25 Jahren gekommen sind"", sagte Trump am Montag in Tokio bei einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Japans Premier Shinzo Abe.

Maximaler Druck auf Pjöngjang

Der japanische Regierungschef beteuerte ebenfalls, dass Japan und die USA im Konflikt um Nordkoreas Atom- und Raketenprogramm den Druck auf Pjöngjang erhöhen wollten. Dies sei nicht die Zeit für Dialog mit Nordkorea.

""Dialog um des Dialoges willen mache keinen Sinn"", sagte Abe. ""Wir wollen durch alle möglichen Mittel den Druck auf Nordkorea bis zum Maximalen erhöhen.""

Konkret kündigte Abe an, die Sanktionen auszuweiten: Die Vermögenswerte von 35 nordkoreanischen Gruppierungen und Einzelpersonen sollen eingefroren werden. Mit dieser Strategie wollen die Verbündeten den andauernden Nukleartests des nordkoreanischen Regimes Einhalt gebieten.

Trump verteidigt Rückzug aus Handelsabkommen TPP

Trump verteidigte in Japan auch den Rückzug der USA aus dem transpazifischen Handelsabkommen TPP. Bei einem Treffen mit Geschäftsleuten sagte Trump am Montagmorgen (Ortszeit) in Tokio: ""Wir werden mehr Handel haben als im Rahmen von TPP, und die Situation wird viel weniger komplex sein."" TPP sei nicht die richtige Idee gewesen.

TPP sollte rund um den Pazifik die größte Freihandelszone der Welt schaffen. Der Vertrag war im Februar 2016 unterzeichnet worden, aber noch nicht in Kraft getreten. Die elf Handelspartner repräsentieren 800 Millionen Menschen und 40 Prozent der Weltwirtschaft. Sie wollen nach dem Rückzug der USA großenteils ohne Amerika weiter vorangehen.

""Der Handel mit Japan ist nicht frei und er ist nicht gegenseitig, aber er wird es bald sein"", sagte Trump. Er habe keinen Zweifel, dass dies fair geschehen werde. Es werde eine Zeit dauern, aber dann werde es Handelsdeals und ""Handelskonzepte"" geben.

Entsprechende Gespräche mit Japan dauerten schon sehr lange. Das finanzielle Ergebnis werde besser für beide Länder sein. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten habe Japan in Handelsfragen mit den USA immer gewonnen, sagte Trump.

Ghanaian artist El Anatsui is one of Africa's most famous artists -- just one of his famous bottle-top works fetches millions of dollars on the international market -- and yet, he has never had an exhibition in South Africa.

But that's about to change.

Meyina, Anatsui's first solo exhibition in the country, will open at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg later this month. Visitors can expect to see seven large sculptural installations alongside some personal artefacts from Anatsui's studio in Nigeria.

Featured in the @nmafa's collection of contemporary African art, El Anatsui and @shonibarestudio have joined the Goodman Gallery roster, with solo shows taking place at the end of 2017 and in 2018. #ElAnatsui #YinkaShonibare #NMAFA #GoodmanGallery A post shared by Goodman Gallery (@goodman_gallery) on Oct 28, 2017 at 5:55am PDT

Anatsui has received global acclaim for his work, which transforms waste products mainly taken from the alcohol industry (bottle tops, glass and metallic papers) into glimmering artworks, which take the form of draped metallic textiles.

Speaking last year, Anatsui said his first exposure with South Africa was through music, as he listened to South African jazz artists on the radio while he was growing up in Ghana.

""I got to know South Africa long ago as a kid through music,"" he said. ""Radio Ghana used to have a programme called 'Way Down South' that played South African music for 30 minutes every Saturday, which I was addicted to. So I grew up knowing names like Dorothy Masuka, Kippie Moeketsi, Little Lemmy and Big Joe, Mahotella Queens, Jazz Epistles, Miriam Makeba and, of course, Hugh Masekela and Abdullah Ibrahim, whose careers I follow closely.""

#elanatsui A post shared by El Anatsui (@anatsuiel) on Mar 1, 2017 at 8:30am PST

Anatsui's work has been exhibited at many of the world major museums, from the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., to the Vatican Museum in Rome.

""The idea that is behind all of my work is to find a sculptural form which is free, which is mutable and variable, and I found it in the bottle-cap pieces. I got tired of statues of 'knights on horses' in bronze or on the walls of museums, which have been the fare for centuries, especially in Western art. I thought that if art is regarded as life, it should reflect the dynamic and constantly changing nature of it, and not freeze just a moment of it. I want my art forms to replicate that kind of quality.""

Late food, loud customers, stroppy staff and over-crowded eating areas are no fun with a baby.
Consider inviting some strangers into your home to glare in your direction, as you eat cold, substandard food.
***If you have any advice on Eating out with a baby... keep it to yourself.","It used to be your favourite thing to do (well, one of them at least) but now the mere mention of it sends shivers down your spine.

I'm talking about eating out... with a baby!

There comes a time in every parent's life when sitting in a nappy-scented house, for hour after hour, cleaning up sick, sterilizing bottles and watching Judge Rinder, is no longer the fun it once was. It's at this point that the idea of taking your child to eat in a restaurant first crosses your mind.

Yet you're reticent, with good reason.

What will the baby do?

Will it scream?

Will it do an explosive poo?

Will it do both?

And then there's the other diners to think of...

Will they be friendly?

Will they glare?

Will they form a mob to have you ejected?

All of this potential stress is often enough to stop new parents leaving the fragrant confines of their homes. Don't let this happen to you!

Here's my advice on How to eat out with a baby...

1: Don't be an idiot

The arrival of a baby in a restaurant is never EVER, EVER, going to make its parents popular. We've all been there. You go out for a quiet meal (perhaps in the hope of it going so well that you skip dessert), and a family who look like they'd struggle to fill out a Jeremy Kyle Show application form arrives at the next table. Your meal is ruined - you eat quickly and call for the bill. The family on the next table, however, are having a great time.

Don't be that family.

A little consideration for your fellow diners goes a long way. It'll make your meal a lot more pleasant to know everyone else in the room isn't silently hating your guts.

2: Don't be too nice

Trying to be considerate to other diners is all very well - but don't be crippled by it. Children make noise, it's as simple as that. As long as you appear to be making attempts to minimize the chaos, you're doing your job. You're not going to have a silent meal, it's impossible. Don't let your child being a child ruin your meal. You need a break too.

3: Be prepared

If you're properly prepared then the whole 'eating out' experience will be infinitely easier. That said, for many new parents, leaving the house wearing two matching shoes can be a struggle, so let's not set our sights too high!

It's totally possible to get through a meal with ease, by timing it to coincide with your baby's naptime. Bring essentials like milk and their favourite toys to ease any transition periods. That said, even the most prepared person in the world might find themselves in a restaurant with a baby who suddenly refuses to play ball.

4: Lower your standards

Do you like eating out at nice restaurants? Sorry, those days are over. From now on you'll be dining in places that have 'Happy', 'Big' & 'Wacky' in their titles. The food is undeniably dubious, the tables are sticky and there's a constant whiff of vomit, but you'll feel so much more relaxed in these places. Why? Well, for one thing, there'll always be another kid doing exactly what you were dreading. So, if your child does melt down, it's unlikely anyone will notice.

NB: A bit of advice, never eat from a buffet bar in one of these establishments. They are at the perfect height for little (snotty) hands to reach and play with the food - before putting in back.

5: Go Early

Visiting a restaurant during peak times will put you in line for a whole heap of pain. Late food, loud customers, stroppy staff and over-crowded eating areas are no fun with a baby.

Perhaps consider going for your meal early or late? Dinner at 2 am is sure to leave you with the place to yourself. If this is too extreme find out when an establishment starts serving food and be there on the dot. A Sunday Roast at 1030 am may seem weird, but it's far a more relaxed than eating it at 1 pm like everyone else.

6: Be ready with comebacks

Having a few witty retorts to use with the inevitable malcontents you'll experience will make your trip much easier. When you find Clive and Norma moaning about the noise you're making, from behind their copies of The Mail On Sunday, be sure to respond appropriately. Loudly shouting phrases such as: ""He may be still infectious, I'm not sure!"" and ""I'll take him outside to change his nappy on the bonnet of that Lexus"" will leave you feeling far more relaxed.

7: Other options

Perhaps, if you feel going out with your baby is too much stress, you could make a meal at home feel like you're in a restaurant. Consider inviting some strangers into your home to glare in your direction, as you eat cold, substandard food. In many ways, with a bit of effort, eating in can be just as much 'fun' as eating out.

If you have any advice on Eating out with a baby... keep it to yourself. Nobody likes a know-it-all!

In the experiment, patients who received the stent didn’t show any difference in chest pain symptoms or enhanced exercise performance compared to patients who underwent a sham procedure.
When people think about placebos and the “placebo effect,” they’re generally thinking of a drug trial that tests an experimental medicine against a harmless sugar pill.
And that’s exactly what happened in the stent experiment.
Bhatt, who is an executive director at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, has also conducted an experiment with a sham procedure in Europe.","A groundbreaking new experiment reveals that stents, which are mesh wire tubes inserted into narrow or weak arteries to widen them and increase blood flow, are no more effective than treating people with medicine when it comes to relieving stable angina, or chest pain, The New York Times first reported.

While stents can save lives in the aftermath of a heart attack, the results from this study suggest people who get them inserted for chest pain — estimated at over 500,000 people every year around the globe — may be benefiting more from a placebo effect than from the device itself.

Experts praised the study, saying it highlights just how crucial it is to test certain therapies with a placebo group, even if that placebo treatment may mean a minimally invasive sham procedure.

The placebo effect is a psychological phenomenon in which a person who is tricked into receiving a fake treatment begins to perceive an improvement in symptoms because they expect the therapy will work. The placebo effect is particularly potent when it comes to the perception of pain.

In the experiment, patients who received the stent didn’t show any difference in chest pain symptoms or enhanced exercise performance compared to patients who underwent a sham procedure.

While the experiment, which was conducted in the U.K., only followed up with participants after six weeks ― a relatively short time when it comes to evaluating a chronic condition ― experts expect the results may influence cardiologists in the U.S. to recommend that patients who can control their pain symptoms with anti-anginal medication should hold off on a stent insertion.

“It’s a really interesting trial and it should make people pause,” said Dr. James Slater, an interventional cardiologist at NYU Langone Health who estimates that he performs hundreds of stent insertions every year. “For the knee-jerk stenters out there, it’s just one more piece of evidence that maybe they should be a little more reluctant to do that.”

“It’ll change me somewhat because for some of those people where I’m on the fence, I think I will move toward not doing as much,” said Dr. Paul Thompson, chief of cardiology at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. “Even though I don’t think I’ve been aggressive about it anyway, I would move toward not recommending it.”

While the study could lead to a change in how American cardiologists approach angina treatment, arguably more important than the results of the study is the way the experiment itself was conducted, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a spokesman with the American Heart Association.

When people think about placebos and the “placebo effect,” they’re generally thinking of a drug trial that tests an experimental medicine against a harmless sugar pill. In this scenario, the sugar pill presents virtually no risk to the study participant who swallows it, and scientists go on to compare their results with people who received the active medicine, in the hope of being able to separate its true physical effect from its placebo effect.

But to test the effectiveness of a device inserted into the body against a placebo, patients who receive the placebo treatment must be led to believe that they could have been operated on ― what’s known as a “sham” procedure. And that’s exactly what happened in the stent experiment.

Participants who were randomly picked to receive the placebo were sedated, and a catheter really was inserted into their body, up a blood vessel close to their heart. But instead of depositing the stent, doctors instead just withdrew the catheter. Some may consider this kind of “deception” in the name of science to be unethical, Bhatt said.

“Since we don’t have a good word for a placebo device, ‘sham’ is used, and that just puts people in a bad frame of mind already, because it sounds like something illicit is going on,” said Bhatt.

Another reason U.S. scientists and institutions are reluctant to approve experiments with sham procedures is that they are still real, invasive procedures. This means they expose the patient to a slight risk with arguably no payoff, as they aren’t receiving the actual treatment.

Indeed, in this stent experiment, four of the 95 participants who were supposed to get the sham procedure ended up experiencing artery disruption during the insertion, which required doctors to insert the stent anyway, even though it was unplanned.

“The authors poo-pooed that and said well, this is the price you pay for this, and none of those people were really hurt,” said Slater, who reviewed the trial but was not involved with it. “But I think in America, where the lawyers are quick to pounce, you might have a little trouble doing something like this.”

Despite the complications, the stent experiment reveals there’s a dire need for scientists to figure out if certain devices or operations really are delivering the results promised to patients ― or whether it’s just a placebo effect due to undergoing some kind of procedure.

Bhatt, who is an executive director at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center, has also conducted an experiment with a sham procedure in Europe. He demonstrated that a promising therapy that zapped kidney nerves to lower blood pressure did not produce results that were any better than a sham procedure. While he was accused of unethically exposing patients to unnecessary invasive procedures, Bhatt’s results instead showed that it would be unethical to keep trying to treat people with an invasive procedure that didn’t work.",A Controversial Experiment Upends The Conventional Wisdom On Heart Stents,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-groundbreaking-heart-stent-experiment-reveals-just-how-powerful-the-placebo-effect-is_us_59fce72de4b0c9652fff6b9a

Rues, cafés, espaces culturels et sportifs, transports... sont occupés différemment. Les incivilités y sont régulières, quand elles n'entraînent pas de situations dramatiques.

Depuis le début de l'année, plusieurs discriminations dont sont victimes les femmes au sein de l'espace public ont été dénoncées de manière massive sur les réseaux sociaux, en témoignent les hashtags qui fleurissent autour du harcèlement (#BalanceTonPorc, #DearCatCaller) ou encore autour du phénomène de #Manspreading -qui consiste à s'asseoir en écartant les cuisses et en occupant ainsi le plus de place possible au détriment des autres voyageurs. La toile est devenue cet espace public sans contour géographique, où les voix se libèrent collectivement et appellent à la mise en place de solutions locales. Ainsi en juin dernier, à Madrid, le métro réagissait au phénomène de #Manspreading en lançant une campagne d'affichage pour sensibiliser la gent masculine, tandis que le collectif français Osez le féminisme invitait la RATP à faire de même, sans succès...

Comment inspirer une mobilité conviviale et un urbanisme pro-féminin? Comment mettre fin au clivage des genres dans les espaces publics? Comment favoriser des actions citoyennes et politiques au service d'un vivre-ensemble égalitaire?

TEDxChampsÉlyséesWomen a choisi cette année de concentrer ses regards sur les réalités physiques et virtuelles dans lesquelles le genre est à l'origine d'une discrimination, et de mettre en lumière des idées venues d'horizons différents, de manière à soulever le débat et inspirer des actions positives en faveur d'une #EQUALIciTY:

- Dans le champ de l'éducation, il est primordial que l'ensemble des systèmes éducatifs revisite les rôles femme-homme et inculquent aux citoyens une culture de solidarité face aux agressions dans l'espace public.

- De même, les politiques publiques se doivent d'être exemplaires et incitatives, à l'image du principe de Gender Budgeting (loi du 12 janvier 2007) défini par le Conseil de l'Europe, qui permet d'évaluer les inégalités financières liées au genre et d'étendre l'obligation de vigilance à tous les services de l'État en matière de dépense publique.

- Nous partageons la conviction que c'est en nous rassemblant en un même lieu un moment donné que nous pourrons tisser des liens et faire émerger collectivement une réflexion constructive au service d'un vivre-ensemble citoyen.

BHOPAL -- In light of the horrific gang-rape of a 19-year-old girl, a city Superintendent of Police (CSP) and three Town Inspectors (SHOs in other states) have faced action. The inspectors who head MP Nagar, Habibganj and GRP police stations have been suspended. The CSP (DSP rank) has been removed and sent to the police headquarters.

Action was taken over the delay in registering an FIR, the harassment caused to the girl and her family. They were turned away from police stations, and despite the horrific crime, and the policemen didn't give a patient hearing to her, let alone registering case.

The actions were taken on directions from Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan

The girl was gangrape and later abandoned near the railway track in Bhopal.

Four men accosted the girl, who is pursuing graduation and preparing for civil services exam, when she was returning from her tuition classes. The accused cornered and overpowered her, took her to a desolate spot near the railway track, close to the Habibganj station, and raped her.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

The accused escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Still, none of the two police stations — MP Nagar and Habibganj, both in the heart of New Bhopal — registered a case, passing the buck on officials of other police stations, saying that area didn't fall under their jurisdiction.

Finally, the railway police registered a case. DSP Anita Malviya told media persons that the girl was gang-raped by four youths — Golu Chadhar, Amar, Rajesh and Ramesh. She said that the accused have been arrested.

Minister for Women and Child Development, Archana Chitnis, called it a shameful incident and demanded death penalty for the culprits.

The incident had occurred late Tuesday night and throughout Wednesday the traumatised family had tried to get an FIR registered, until railway police registered the case.

Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Bhopal had ordered a probe into the apathy of the policemen in question.

The MP Human Rights Commission has sought a report from Bhopal police on the incident that has left Bhopal in shock.

Every time a film presents different versions of the same story, the film critics can't help but compare it to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950). A couple of examples that come to mind are Rakhi Gulzar's Talvar (2015) and Sudhir Mishra's Inkaar (2013). In Abhay Chopra's Ittefaq, a remake of the 1969 film of the same name, we learn that a famous author is charged for committing two murders on the same night: his wife, and a lawyer whose house he accidentally breaks into while trying to escape.

Throughout the interrogation, the author maintains that he is innocent. However, his account of what actually happened that night completely differs from the account of the dead lawyer's wife. Now, all those who have compared Ittefaq with Rashomon are clearly missing the point. The fact of the matter is that in Rashomon, Kurosawa never makes an attempt to lead the viewer. He merely shows us the same event from four different points of view. Rashomon doesn't feed us with lies, only the different faces of truth. Ittefaq, on the other hands, keeps feeding us with lies. Alas, even the lies are not good enough to be deemed believable!

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like Golmaal Again (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers.

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like ""Golmaal Again"" (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers. Now, Ittefaq has been described as smart and gripping by some. While the film is certainly gripping for the most part, calling it smart would be a grave misjudgment. In Ittefaq's big reveal towards the end, the killer, minutes before boarding an international flight, confesses to the investigating officer during a telephonic conversation and offers a detailed account of the chain of events leading to the crime.

The officer is so thrilled to hear the killer's exhilarating account that he just doesn't seem interested in exercising the protocol needed to prevent the airplane from taking off. If that's not difficult enough to digest then just imagine how the police, during the course of investigation, can't figure out that the author's wife happened to be a client of the lawyer's. Isn't this connection the key to solving the two murders? How come an investigating officer who is smart enough to trace the hidden murder weapon is unable to figure out this basic fact? The film very conveniently tries to mislead us for nearly two hours, only to set us up for one lofty final twist in the vein of The Usual Suspects, merely adding insult to injury.

""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""

Whenever one speaks of crime and investigation a reference to Sir Authur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is inevitable. ""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,"" says the super-sleuth in the short story titled ""The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"" (1926). Ittefaq fails to pay any heed to this basic science of deduction . The end result is an average whodunit that seems to have little regard for the viewer's intelligence. Another time tested tool to assess suspense thrillers is to watch them a second or a third time. While films like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017), "" Gone Girl "" (2014), ""Teesri Manzil"" (1966), ""Manorama Six Feet Under"" (2007) and "" Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! "" (2015) would hold up well on subsequent viewings, an average film like Ittefaq will most likely struggle to hold the viewer's attention during a second or a third viewing. In comparison to the remake, the original, directed by Yash Chopra, is more than capable of holding the viewer's attention on subsequent viewings, even after all these years.

Usually it's the movie's plot and performances that can make it worthy of subsequent viewings. The editing, direction, cinematography and background score can of course immen sely add to the overall experience. Take the case of Shekhar Kapoor and Karan Razdan-directed detective television series ""Tehkikaat"" which used to air on Doordarshan during the mid-90s. While the performances were a wee bit melodramatic and the plots often lacked the brilliance of a Sherlock Holmes or a Byomkesh Bakshi, the chilling background score and the camerawork added a different layer of mystery.

It's a bit perplexing to think why the makers, especially given its co-produced by Dharma Productions, Red Chillies Entertainment, and B.R. Studios, didn't focus on at least getting a strong background score in place? With the exception of Akshaye Khanna, Ittefaq is also quite average on the acting front. While Sonakshi Sinha has her moments in the movie, Sidharth Malhotra looks a bit flat. But he alone can't be blamed for it, for an average part requires an above-average actor. Given his limitations as a performer, Sidharth seems to have tried his best but unfortunately on this occasion his best just doesn't turn out to be good enough. Ittefaq offers promise to begin with but ultimately it fails to leave any lasting impact. The film can serve as a decent way to spend your free time when you have nothing better to indulge in and that too only as long as you can do away with any logical thinking.

Ist man aber von Beruf Erzieherin, rate ich dringend davon ab.

So findet man nämlich dort Posts, in denen eine Mutter von ihrem erschütterten Vertrauen zu der Erzieherin ihres Sohnes berichtet, weil diese ihn im KiGa beim Essen für 2 Minuten vor die Tür gesetzt hat, da er sich dort angefangen hatte zu prügeln.

Das Kind wäre jetzt emotional total am Boden... Musste das Zimmer verlassen, bis die Erzieherin nach kam, um die Situation mit dem Kind in Ruhe zu klären. Sie fühle sich überhaupt nicht mehr wohl jetzt dort.

Muss man hier schon etwas schmunzeln, so liest man am besten nicht weiter, was andere Mütter darunter schreiben:

""Das ist verletzte Aufsichtspflicht! Dafür kannst du sie kündigen lassen!""

""Melde das dem Träger.""

""Erkundige dich beim Rechtsanwalt.""

""Vielleicht kann man den KiGa deshalb schließen lassen, frag mal bei Jugendamt nach.""

Ungelogen.

Alltag im Kindergarten

Ich habe mir also ein Herz gefasst und versucht zu erklären, wie eine Essenssituation im KiGa abläuft:

20 Kinder sitzen um einen Tisch und warten darauf, dass du jedem von Ihnen das Essen austeilst. Nebenbei rufen die ersten schon wieder nach was zu trinken, weil ihr Glas schon ausgetrunken ist. Ein kleineres Kind braucht Hilfe dabei, sein Fleisch zu schneiden.

Ein weiteres jammert darüber, dass ihm das Essen nicht schmeckt. Der Nebenmann schmeißt das Glas um, die Pfütze muss aufgewischt werden. Wieder leere Trinkgläser. Zwei Kinder streiten, weil einer eine Nudel vom Teller des anderen geklaut hat und die zwei daneben bewerfen sich giggelnd mit ihrem Essen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir Erzieher stehen jeden Tag kurz vor dem Burnout

So... Ist es da nicht vielleicht gar nicht soooooo unverständlich, dass das Kind kurz draußen warten soll, bis alle versorgt sind, damit die Erzieherin dann in Ruhe mit ihm sprechen kann um die Situation zu klären? Vor allem, wenn die Gruppentüre ein Glasfenster hat, um sehen zu können, was draußen vor sich geht?

Ich habe für diese Darstellung viele ""Likes"" bekommen, hauptsächlich von anderen Erzieherinnen. Von den anderen wurde meine Sicht der Dinge ignoriert. Ganz klar, sonst kann man sich ja nicht weiter aufregen.

Keine Ahnung von den Aufgaben der Erzieher

Nun könnte man meinen, dieses Phänomen tritt nur im Internet auf. Aber nein.

Zurück in der Arbeitswelt, kann ich nur noch Kopfschütteln. Und es wird mit jedem Jahr nur schlimmer... KiGa-Bashing, das neue Hobby vieler Eltern. Eine ganz neue Art des Mobbing ist geboren.

Als Erzieher ist es heutzutage kaum mehr möglich, sich auf die Bedürfnisse der Kinder zu konzentrieren, da einige Eltern ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse beim Personal an erster Stelle sehen.

Es ist nicht mehr möglich, überhaupt irgendetwas richtig zu machen, deshalb verbringt man gefühlte Stunden damit, sich morgens oder mittags vor Eltern im Flur zu rechtfertigen, warum dieses oder jenes so passiert ist.

So kommt zum Beispiel eine Mutter mit der Beschwerde, man habe ihr am Vortag nicht gesagt, dass ihr Kind im Flur beim Anziehen Streit angefangen habe. Sie möchte so etwas aber bitte dringend immer sofort mitgeteilt bekommen, denn schließlich möchte sie dann mit ihrem Kind darüber reden können, dass man so etwas nicht tut.

Ok... das ist jetzt zum Beispiel eine der Aufgaben, die ein Erzieher eigentlich hat: Hilfe bei der Konfliktlösung. Vielleicht habe das aber auch bloß ich falsch verstanden.

Jedenfalls wird bei dieser Beschwerde und gleichzeitigen Bitte anscheinend übersehen, dass wir nicht nur ein Kind betreuen. Und bei einer Gruppe von 20 Kindern würde es ziemlich viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen, jeder Mutter beim Abholen einen Bericht darüber zu erstatten, wann ihr Kind sich gestritten hat. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: Kinder streiten ständig!

Auch kommt es manchmal vor, dass ein Kind dabei ausholt, und dem andern Kind ""eine scheppert"". Natürlich greifen wir Erzieher dann ein (selten schaffen wir das, bevor es ""klatsch"" gemacht hat, wir sind Menschen, keine Fantasyfiguren mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit), erklären, dass man dem andern nicht weh tun darf und zeigen alternative Handlungsmöglichkeiten auf.

Wir überprüfen, ob sich der andere weh getan hat, reichen Kühlbeutel und Kügelchen.

Beim Abholen werden Eltern von ""Täter"" und ""Opfer"" informiert, damit sie Bescheid wissen, falls Ihre Kinder daheim davon erzählen. Passt, oder? Nein, passt nicht.

Drohungen und Beleidigungen gegen das Personal

Greift ein Kind noch zwei mal öfter darauf zurück, sich körperlich zu wehren oder zu äußern, gibt es schon nach kürzester Zeit die lautstarke Forderung von Eltern, dieses Kind dem Jugendamt zu melden.

Es wird von einer Gefahrenlage im Kindergarten gesprochen. Ja, es wird sogar der Kindergarten gewechselt. Weil das ja sonst nirgends vorkommt oder toleriert wird! Nur hier ist das so.

Dass es sich hierbei um Kinder handelt, die zwei Minuten nach ihrem Streit wieder miteinander spielen und keiner dabei verletzt wurde, vergessen die Eltern hierbei leider komplett.

Natürlich gibt es auch Kinder, die tatsächlich Bedürfnisse haben, die ihr derzeitiger Kindergarten nicht erfüllen kann. Je nachdem worum es dabei geht, und vor allem, wenn so viel ""körperliches Verhalten"" im Spiel ist, kann man den Eltern dann also höflich ans Herz legen, dass heilpädagogisch geschultes Personal ihrem Kind besser dabei helfen kann, seine Konflikte zu bewältigen.

Dabei lässt man dann ganz bewusst weg, dass ihr Kind nicht aufgrund von Hochbegabung ""unterfordert"" ist, wie von den Eltern geschildert, sondern das Problem wo anders liegt.

Wenn's so einfach denn wäre... Nein.

""Was für ein unfähiges Personal kommt jetzt nicht mit meinem Kind zurecht? Dieser Kindergarten ist das Allerletzte! Andere müssen vor euch gewarnt werden!""

Wenn man dann als privater Kindergarten auch noch das Recht hat, den Betreuungsvertrag zu kündigen, weil man mit den Eltern zusammen im Gespräch nicht weiter kommt und sich angemessene Hilfe für das Kind wünscht (und andere Eltern berechtigterweise schon mit dem Jugendamt drohen) erreicht der Frust dieser Eltern ganz neue Dimensionen.

Drohungen, den Kindergarten bei der Familienministerin zu melden. Beim Landesjugendamt über das unfähige Personal informieren wollen.

Ja, solche Drohungen gehören mittlerweile zum Alltag eines Erziehers.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Die Eltern werden dir die Hölle heiß machen"" - das habe ich in 40 Jahren als Erzieherin gelernt

Erzieher sollen sich aber ganz selbstverständlich beißen lassen, wenn man versucht, das Kind zu beruhigen. Immerhin sind wir ja selber schuld, unfähig wie wir sind.

Organisierte Elternbanden

Man könnte jetzt sagen: Ok, vielleicht ist das ein Problem der privaten Einrichtungen. Aber nein! Die Kollegin aus dem Regelkindergarten erzählt, dass sie einen Papa im Garten neulich fragte, warum er mit seinem Handy Fotos der dort zum Spielen vorhandenen Fahrräder macht.

Sie wurde dann darüber aufgeklärt, dass sein Kind sich an einem Fahrrad in den Finger geschnitten hat. Drei Tage später kam ein Brief vom Rechtsanwalt der gegen den Kindergarten klagt, weil bei einem Fahrrad am Lenker der Gummigriff fehlte und sich das Kind dort verletzt habe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eltern: Hört auf, eure Kinder zu verweichlichten Menschen zu erziehen

Oder aber organisierte Elternbanden, die sich beim Bürgermeister beschweren, weil der Kindergarten sich pädagogisch begründet weigert, das Vorschulprogramm nach den Vorstellungen einzelner Eltern für alle zu erweitern.

Wenn ich also morgens aufstehe und mich für die Arbeit fertig mache denke ich mir nicht: Oh ja, heute backe ich Kuchen mit den Kids! Sondern: Mal sehen, was mich heute wieder davon abhält, Kuchen mit den Kids zu backen.

Die traurige Wahrheit ist: Die ganze Zeit, die wir damit verbringen, uns mit solchen Dingen herumzuschlagen, verbringen wir eben nicht bei den Kindern.

Aber liebe Eltern, was glaubt ihr denn, wem ihr hier eure Kinder anvertraut? Sind wir auf das viele Geld aus, dass man als Erzieher verdient? Bekommt man einen Erzieherabschluss durchs Beantworten von Multiple-Choice-Fragen im Internet?

Wir wollen für eure Kinder da sein

Erzieher sind Menschen, die es sich zum Beruf gemacht haben, für eure Kinder da zu sein. Wir wollen sie umsorgen, ihnen etwas beibringen und ihnen einen geborgenen Raum für ihre Entwicklung schaffen.

Die ganze Negativität, die tagtäglich über das ""Nichts-recht-machen-können"" in unseren Gruppenalltag eindringt, verstört Kinder und Personal.

Wir opfern unsere Freizeit, um Spielzeug für Eure Kinder zu basteln, um Feste vorzubereiten und um uns Beschäftigungen mit Lerneffekt auszudenken.

Die geopferte Freizeit wird aber mit jedem mal Drama etwas weniger. Denn ganz ehrlich: Wer hat schon Lust, sich unbezahlt Gedanken über die Arbeit zu machen, wenn man als Dank dafür schlecht gemacht wird und sich beleidigen lassen muss?

Liebe besagte Eltern, seht ihr nicht, dass ihr höchstpersönlich dafür sorgt, dass die Qualität schlechter und die Geduld weniger wird, die wir gerne für eure Kinder übrig hätten?

Jedem, der sich in diesen Beispielen mit ähnlichem Verhalten wiedererkennt, möchte ich sagen:

Ihr seid die Tyrannen, die ihren Anteil am Personalnotstand der Kindergärten haben.

Wer möchte schon freiwillig unter solchen Umständen arbeiten?!

Es gibt sie noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern

Abschließend möchte ich aber dringend betonen: Es gibt sie natürlich noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern!

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens nicht aufstehe, um mir zu überlegen, wie ich sie ärgern kann oder ihr Kind negativ in seiner Entwicklung beeinflussen kann.

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens aufstehe, weil ich ihre Kinder liebe, und nur das Beste für die mir anvertrauten kleinen Menschen will.

Die Eltern, die ""Danke"" sagen.

Die Eltern, die mir nicht sofort böse Absicht unterstellen, wenn tatsächlich mal ein Fehler passiert.

Die Eltern, die zu vernünftigen Gesprächen bereit sind, wenn es ein Problem gibt.

Bitte, liebe ""normale"" Eltern! Ihr müsst endlich lauter sein als die Dauer-Motzer und Drama-Verursacher! Damit wir weiterhin wissen, warum wir morgens aufstehen und nicht irgendwann resignieren.

Although many people might think there's no good use for carved pumpkins after Halloween, this isn't true at all. According to the National Wildlife Federation's blog, there are plenty of ways to recycle your pumpkin, including composting, planting the seeds, or turning it into a snack-o-lantern (a.k.a a bird feeder).

Around 18 months ago I travelled back to the UK to surprise my father for his 70th birthday party. It was an absolutely magical moment as I shuffled towards the front door with a cardboard box in front of my face and yelled ""SURPRISE!"".

My dad was delighted, my brother and sister were delighted, and so was my mum. Even though she and Dad have been divorced for 17 years -- more than half my life -- she was the one who drove me to the party.

We are a loving, supportive family, but we are not a conventional family. My mum came out when I was 14. In a dimly lit room, she quietly told me that the woman we knew as a close friend was someone she had embarked on a relationship with.

My parents lived together (in separate rooms) for a further two years, something that I now see for the huge sacrifice it was: living in the same house to provide stability and consistency for their teenage children.

Love is the basis of our family, not marriage.

Tony Abbott recently wrote that, ""if you change marriage, you change society; because marriage is the basis of family; and family is the foundation of community"".

Of course, every family is different. But in my family, what matters wasn't and isn't that my parents divorced, or that my mum came out. What mattered, what still matters most, is love, support and respect.

When my mum moved out of the home that my brother, my sister and I grew up in, she moved five minutes around the corner so we could walk between each parent's house and sleep at whichever house we wanted to. No complicated custody agreements, just whatever my siblings and I wanted to do. When my dad made us 'curry' during his experimental cooking phase, we ate it even though pineapple, chicken, curry sauce and peas are not necessarily an appetising combination. We ate it because he tried.

If my mum knew Dad was at work, she would come over -- take the back-door key from its 'secret' hiding spot -- wash and dry his curtains and re-hang them before he got home. Not because my dad was lazy, he simply didn't notice when the curtains were dirty, and Mum wanted the house to be nice for all of us.

Dad never said a bad word about Mum, and Mum never said a bad word about Dad. They had each other's backs. We spent every birthday and Christmas together, sometimes with my parent's new partners. And now they both have long-term partners or companions who we have known for years -- it's almost like having a mum, a dad and then two more mums.

That's not to say it was never sad or hard to accept that they had separated. It doesn't mean that we never argued with our parents, or had teenage tantrums or that Mum and Dad were perfect. We all f****d up in different ways, but the one consistency was love.

My family has helped me understand that marriage is simply allowing two people who are in love to have that love recognised by law. Conflating family and marriage does a disservice to both.

Having an unconventional family has not harmed me or my brother or sister. We have all gone on to be successful and happy in our chosen fields. We did this with our 21st Century, decidedly non-nuclear family. We did it because our parents backed us, and loved us, and told us if we worked hard we could be what we wanted in life.

So we did. And we are. My family is not about the specific sum of its parts, the number of men or women who play the role of parents, it's about how capable each member of the family is to love and support one another, unconditionally.

It's about parents answering phone calls at 1am when their kids are in a foreign country and stressed out about work. It's about writing 12 cards to be opened on each of the 12 days of Christmas when a daughter lives overseas or taking a six-hour round trip to drive and pick up a child from the airport.

Once, four or five years ago, the five of us had dinner at Dad's house. Mum mentioned that someone had asked her when she would be getting some grandchildren, and she had warned them never to say that in front of my brother or sister or me. We thanked her and Dad for never pressuring us to be -- or do -- anything other than what made us happy. Dad looked taken aback. ""Of course! Our job is just to support you and help you be happy,"" he said. I won't ever forget that.

The truth is that my parents were, and are, better as friends. They should be allowed to love and marry who they want. That should be the case for everyone, including here in Australia. Because loving who they wanted enabled them to be better parents, better and happier people and made our family vastly richer in love and understanding.

It has made my siblings and I better people, more capable of being better members of our communities.

These days, when we are called out about something, it is usually on some type of social media.
If this mom or dad was standing directly in front of me and we were having this conversation, would I say it to their face?

I'm not naive enough to think that there won't be people who will hear my parenting opinions and be affronted by how different they are from theirs. I get that. It's a free country, with free speech and we are all allowed to express our opinions.

But what makes me cringe is when people start calling each other ""bad parents"" and making hurtful comments about each other. It's happening more and more on social media these days. It has happened to me. When it did, I tried to shake it off. They didn't know me and I didn't know them, so I knew that I shouldn't let it bother me. But guess what? While I'm growing it every day, my skin is still somewhat thin on the parenting front. And when someone rants and raves at me online and calls me a disgrace of a mom just because I parent in a way that is different from them, then I say ""enough!""

Our own parents never had to deal with parenting in an online world. We are pioneers, blazing our way through this new uncharted territory. These days, when we are called out about something, it is usually on some type of social media. People will say the most horrendous things to another human being when they are typing it, rather than speaking it face to face.

While I'm growing it every day, my skin is still somewhat thin on the parenting front.

Maybe that should be the test that we use in our online discussions. If this mom or dad was standing directly in front of me and we were having this conversation, would I say it to their face? And if it's something very hurtful and you still think that you would say it, then maybe it's time to do a little soul-searching to see if you are a person who builds others up or tears them down. Because that's what we are doing with our words. We are tearing people down. Once people see those words in black and white, they can't unsee them. I have had to work at learning to let things slide off my back so that I don't slip into believing some of the awful things that have been said about me. And I know in my heart that they aren't true. But they can still hurt.

So truly, unless a child is in real danger, no parent has the right to call out another parent in such a way. In a way that throws little proverbial spears right into everything they hold sacred. I've come to realize that I've earned the right to parent as I choose. I've pushed my babies out my... oh, wait... nope. I had a C-section. And my second C-section was planned. I had no desire to try for a V-bac (vaginal birth after C-section). Cue angry readers here. And yes I had an obstetrician instead of a midwife. I preferred to give birth in a hospital with a doctor. I'm sure that will offend someone to the point of raging at me. I also waited to feed my kids solids until six months. There will be people in a huff because they started earlier... or later.

And what about things like ""crying it out"", co-sleeping, or being a working mom/stay-at-home mom? All of these can be polarizing issues. But can you begin to see how petty it can be to name call a parent for the decisions they've made about their own child? And yet each of these things listed can bring out strong reactions (in moms particularly). And it's okay to have a strong reaction about how I parent versus how you parent. But it's not OK to call me a horrible mom. It's time that we started having each other's backs. And at the very least, just agreeing to disagree when thoughtful discussion of our differences is not possible.

Bottom line, if you parent completely differently that I do? You are not a horrible parent. Even though we don't parent the same way. I bet you are actually a pretty darn good parent. Because you are doing you. What works best for your family. And I am doing me. And guess what? I'm a pretty darn good parent too. And the only ones who are actually qualified to judge me on my parenting skills are 11 and eight and they say I'm the best mom in the world.

So rather than jumping all over each other, let's engage in thoughtful discussions. Let's try not to attack each other's parenthood. Let's have each other's backs. Because if you love your kids, then I bet you're doing a pretty great job with them. (And don't deserve to have that questioned.) So the next time you see someone say something on social media that makes your blood boil, take a breath, a deep one, and feel free to comment and even disagree, but let's try to keep the ""you suck"" type comments to a minimum. Because on the other side of the computer is a real-life parent who despite their different opinion, is just trying to muddle through this whole parenting gig. Like we all are.

En effet, face au présidentialisme tout-puissant, les parlementaires doivent davantage occuper l'espace de leur pouvoir.

La première question récurrente posée sur la refonte du Parlement est la suivante: faut-il supprimer le Sénat? Réponse en toutes lettres: NON. La France a besoin d'une assemblée représentant les territoires, en recompositions constantes depuis au moins dix ans. Le Sénat doit continuer à articuler l'organisation décentralisée avec l'indivisibilité républicaine. Pour être plus légitimes, cent sénateurs au total pourraient être élus dans les 13 régions aux périmètres récemment revus. Ils procéderaient du suffrage universel direct, lors d'un scrutin simultané d'élections locales regroupées.

Une assemblée nationale proche des électeurs

La seconde question est la suivante: faut-il moins de députés? Le gouvernement le souhaite. Au nombre de 577, il s'agirait d'en compter 400. Or, il y en eût plus de 600 lorsque la France comptait deux fois moins d'habitants... Le député est en droit un représentant de la Nation, et en fait, un médiateur entre l'intérêt national et ses électeurs. Il doit leur rester proche. Or, il y a en moyenne un député pour 115.000 habitants; est-ce trop? NON. D'ailleurs, les thuriféraires de l'efficacité tous azimuts veulent aussi, paradoxe, augmenter le recrutement des collaborateurs... Moins d'élus pour plus d'agents: la logique est-elle démocratique? Le pouvoir actuel organise une telle dérive technocratique, que la renforcer au Parlement confinera à la saturation.

Rénover la fabrique de la loi

Un député ou un sénateur qui retrouve le sens de la fabrique de la loi se consacre à sa tâche délibérative et au contrôle de l'administration. Cumulant désormais moins les mandats, il cumule dans le meilleur des cas une expérience d'expert-citoyen dans les domaines qu'il suit. À cet égard, il est urgent de former autrement que par séminaires one shot les élus de la Nation. Ensuite, comment améliorer le travail parlementaire? Nombre de propositions sont faites au sujet du fonctionnement interne.

Insistons surtout sur l'inclusion continue des citoyens à la fabrique législative. L'organisation régulière de réunions, afin de tester et/ou de penser des amendements ou des dispositions législatives, devrait devenir la norme dans chaque circonscription –d'où l'intérêt de leur garder une taille raisonnable. Tout parlementaire durant son mandat organiserait obligatoirement au moins deux concertations publiques sur des textes dans lesquels il s'investit. Le règlement des assemblées proposerait aussi des outils numériques pour stimuler cette participation citoyenne. Le député serait alors identifié comme élu privilégié pour organiser la médiation entre les électeurs de proximité et la Nation. Et ce moyen lui permettrait de retrouver de la légitimité entre deux mandats.

ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — There were outraged headlines around the world when about 80 women and children were left to die in the freezing North Atlantic off Newfoundland as crew members raced to save themselves.

It was Sept. 27, 1854. The luxury ship Arctic had collided in heavy fog with the steamer Vesta off Cape Race, N.L., killing an estimated 350 people.

Editorial writers and readers were incensed over the blatant violation of what is today considered an increasingly archaic custom — women and children first. Public anger over the Arctic helped shape that almost mythic tradition of nautical gallantry in the face of death, but it was still an inconsistent practice in the decades that followed.

Roger Marsters, curator of marine history at Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, holding a model ship.

It is now widely seen as anachronistic, a sort of Victorian throwback with no legal weight, said Roger Marsters, curator of marine history at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax.

""It's certainly not a rule that has any force in international maritime law,"" he said in an interview. ""At its best, it's a custom. But more realistically I think it's an ideal that's espoused more often that it is observed.""

Historically, far more men survived shipwrecks than women, and more women survived than children, he said in an interview.

""Titanic's officers and crew actually enforced women and children first.""

Just over 700 people would be rescued from lifeboats or makeshift rafts after the so-called unsinkable ship went down after striking an iceberg April 15, 1912, about 600 kilometres off Newfoundland's southeast tip.

This 1912 photograph of the RMS Titanic was released before the 100th anniversary of its sinking.

Survivors of the sinking of the Titanic rest aboard the RMS Carpathia, the ship that rescued them, on April 18, 1912.

More than 1,500 people died. They included almost 80 per cent of male crew whose discipline has been immortalized in plays and movies about the great ship's sinking.

Overall, the survival rate on Titanic for men was around 20 per cent, compared to about 74 per cent for women and 52 per cent for children.

The cry ""women and children first"" is initially traced to the wreck of HM Troopship Birkenhead off South Africa after it struck a reef and sank on Feb. 26, 1852. On board were more than 600 military personnel, including members of the Queen's (Second) Royal Regiment of Foot.

The captain ordered that 25 women and 29 children be launched in a cutter, one of the few lifeboats available. Accounts of that night describe how troops who mustered on listing decks as the vessel began to tilt, her stern rising, obeyed orders not to move until those passengers were safely away.

'Women, children first' inspired 1852 poem

Rudyard Kipling hailed their sacrifice in the poem ""Soldier an' Sailor too"" with the line: ""But to stand and be still to the Birken 'ead drill is a damn tough bullet to chew.""

The Arctic disaster off Newfoundland two years later was notorious as a very different, ""every man for himself"" response.

Newspaper accounts said several of the Arctic's lifeboats capsized in rough waters as panic erupted despite the captain's attempts to restore order. There were reports that crew members seized remaining lifeboats, leaving about 80 women and children to die.

A study in 2012 by Swedish economists at Uppsala University suggests what happened on the Arctic was no isolated incident. It analyzed 18 maritime disasters from 1852 to 2011 involving more than 15,000 passengers and crew from 30 countries. It found that women had a survival advantage over men in just two of those incidents — Titanic and the Birkenhead.

Women had smaller survival advantage in disasters

In 11 other shipwrecks, women were at a disadvantage. In five more, there was no clear distinction.

""Indeed, we find that crew members have a relative survival advantage in nine of the 19 disasters,"" wrote co-authors Mikael Elinder and Oscar Erixson.

Crew are likely to be more familiar with the vessel, have emergency training and get early details of danger, the study noted. Men are also often physically stronger than women.

""In the evacuation of a sinking ship, success is typically determined by the ability to move fast through corridors and stairs, which is often made difficult by heavy list, congestion and debris,"" the study said.

Captains with ultimate authority onboard set the tone in a crisis, it says. Francesco Schettino was captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia that partially sank after hitting rocks off the island of Giglio on Jan. 13, 2012, killing 32 passengers and crew. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison for manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.

It's sort of a Victorian-era custom that developed late in the 19th century ... women today obviously are viewed as much more able to take care of themselves. Peter Swanson, lawyer from Bernard LLP

Schettino would later say that, as chaos broke out during a frantic evacuation, he slipped and landed on the roof of a lifeboat.

There is no legal requirement that women and children get priority during rescues at sea, says maritime lawyer Peter Swanson of the Vancouver-based firm Bernard LLP.

""It's sort of a Victorian-era custom that developed late in the 19th century,"" he said in an interview.

It could also raise a Charter of Rights challenge if applied in modern times, Swanson added.

""Women today obviously are viewed as much more able to take care of themselves.""

On aurait pu imaginer que la victoire d'Emmanuel Macron allait enfin réveiller quelque chose de l'esprit français... Il avait réussi à mettre à la retraite anticipée une bonne partie de la classe politique, il était parvenu à redonner du prestige à la fonction présidentielle... Mais surtout, il était le premier à inscrire à nouveau son action dans l'histoire... mais sans rencontrer l'assentiment d'une majorité des Français, qui semble pour le moment bienveillants et attentistes.

Les indicateurs économiques sont corrects, le poids de la fonction publique constitue un énorme amortisseur social mais c'est un fait la France déprime, comme si personne ne parvenait à se projeter dans un avenir proche.

La responsabilité n'incombe évidemment pas au Président de la République et cette réalité met en évidence une autre singularité, celle des pays catholiques...

Les Allemands n'hésitent pas à souligner la négligence des Etats du Sud de l'Europe, ""les pays du Club Med"" entend-on parfois à Bruxelles.

Si l'histoire de ces pays et pour chacun d'entre eux fort différentes, il convient de constater qu'il y a quelque chose de commun aux Espagnols, -et moins aux Catalans, Italiens et Français...

En effet, ce sont des pays où la notion de responsabilité individuelle, de libre arbitre s'efface devant un corps social encore infantile qui attend le salut de l'Etat, des autres, Tantôt protégé par un Etat trop généreux, la France, un poids familial étouffant (l'Italie ou l'Espagne), les individus ne parviennent pas à se projeter dans un avenir où chacun doit faire preuve d'initiative...

On préfère alors s'accrocher à des chimères, à des recettes que l'on sait au fond de soi périmées mais qui font tellement de bien à entendre... C'est le choix du confort mental au prix d'un inconfort économique.

Plus que l'Italie ou l'Espagne, la France est paradoxale... C'est dans ce même pays que où la population qui fraude le plus le fisc reste celle qui reçoit le plus d'argent de l'Etat... C'est aussi le pays où les indépendants qui fulminent contre la pression fiscale demandent toujours une aide de l'Etat en cas de coup dur.

Mais dans le même temps, on est aussi un pays où les investissements sont nombreux, où l'on dépose beaucoup de brevets et où le nombre de starts-up autour de la révolution numérique témoigne d'une réelle vitalité.

La division n'est pas seulement entre une France qui va bien et une autre qui va mal... Beaucoup d'entrepreneurs gagnent un petit Smic mais décident de parier sur l'avenir tandis que d'autres peinent à se projeter positivement dans l'avenir alors qu'ils sont fonctionnaires et donc protégés. C'est au cœur de ce paradoxe que s'inscrit depuis le début le macronisme, mais c'est aussi sa difficulté dans la société française d'aujourd'hui...

Pour pouvoir réunir ces 2 groupes, on peut continuer à attendre une solution du politique quitte à perpétuer un certain infantilisme du corps social. Mais il faut constater que depuis 15 ans, c'est le refrain d'un ""c'était mieux avant"" qui est répandu dans les médias.. On a offert une tribune incroyable aux néo-réacs, d'Eric Zemmour à Natasha Polony... Les élites continuent de railler le monarchisme de nos institutions, qui pourtant pourraient réunir à nouveau une majorité de nos concitoyens.

Tout se passe comme si le ""Je"" avait fini par dévorer le ""nous"", comme si la tyrannie de l'Instant avait fini par nous écarter de l'Histoire. Face à un tel tableau, il n'est pas étonnant que notre pays bascule dans la dépression... Emmanuel Macron veut croire à son rôle dans notre histoire... L'avenir dira si la société française est prête à abandonner une partie de son héritage passé, de ses rentes multiples pour se projeter collectivement dans le futur... Si tel n'était pas le cas, et en dépit de son indéniable volonté, le Président Macron aura été le témoin impuissant d'un déclin français.

Nous défendrons nos droits jusqu'au bout."" Ce 6 novembre, alors que le désormais ex-gouvernement catalan en est réduit à choisir entre l'exil en Belgique et l'emprisonnement en Espagne, son leader déchu Carles Puigdemont s'est exprimé au moyen d'une tribune publiée sur le site des Britanniques de The Guardian.

Un texte dans lequel il parle sans retenue, accusant directement Madrid d'agir de manière antidémocratique et de chercher à étouffer la voix du peuple. ""Est-ce que quelqu'un pense que le gouvernement catalan aura droit à une audience juste et indépendante, non-influencée par la politique et la pression médiatique? Je ne le crois pas"", écrit Carles Puigdemont.

""En agissant de manière arbitraire, antidémocratique et selon moi illégale, l'État espagnol a décidé de dissoudre le parlement catalan en pleine législature, de révoquer le président et le gouvernement catalan, d'intervenir dans notre autonomie et dans les institutions que les Catalans ont construites au sein de notre nation depuis des siècles. ""

Un projet toujours assumé

Plus loin, celui qui était devenu le 130e président de Catalogne en 2016 critique le traitement judiciaire réservé à ses proches. ""Les leaders de ce projet démocratique sont désormais accusés de rébellion et risquent la sanction la plus sévère de la loi espagnole, la même que pour un assassinat ou du terrorisme: 30 ans de prison."" De même, il qualifie l'emprisonnement de plusieurs membres du gouvernement ""d'outrage colossal qui aura de très sérieuses conséquences"", et ce alors que contrairement à d'autres factions indépendantistes, les Catalans ""n'ont jamais opté pour la violence, bien au contraire.""

Dans sa tribune, Carles Puigdemont réaffirme que sa volonté de proclamer l'indépendance était au cœur du programme sur lequel son parti s'est présenté et a remporté les élections catalanes en 2015. ""Les gens qui nous ont soutenu ont toujours su quel était notre objectif. Et pourtant, deux ans après ces élections, nous sommes accusés de sédition, de conspiration et de rébellion pour avoir simplement poursuivi un programme électoral qui n'a jamais été secret.""

""Ce qui est en jeu, c'est la démocratie""

Une raison pour laquelle le président déchu s'en prend vertement à la manière dont l'Espagne gère les volontés d'indépendance. ""Il y a deux niveaux de démocratie: on peut être un parti pro-indépendance, mais uniquement si on n'est pas au pouvoir."" Et de critiquer une fois de plus un pays qui veut présenter à la justice ""ceux qui respectent leurs engagement électoraux"" et ""où les liens entre la justice et l'exécutif sont visibles par tous.""

Au lendemain de sa libération conditionnelle par la justice belge, Carles Puigdemont accuse finalement le gouvernement espagnol d'avoir facilité la tâche de l'extrême-droite et des fascistes. ""Dans des manifestations organisées par le parti au pouvoir en Espagne, les héritiers directs du régime de Franco ont marché, certains brandissant des drapeaux fascistes et faisant des saluts nazis.""

""Nous continuerons de dénoncer à la face du monde les graves manquements démocratiques désormais évidents en Espagne"", ajoute-t-il. ""Nous défendrons nos droits jusqu'au bout. Parce que ce que qui est en jeu est bien supérieur à nos avenirs personnels: ce qui est en jeu, c'est la démocratie elle-même.""

Die Marihuana-Pflanzen sollen sowohl der Wissenschaft zugute kommen, als auch für medizinische Zwecke genutzt werden. Der Anbau soll ab März 2018 beginnen.

COME ON MUSLIMS SAY THIS EVERYDAY IN PRAYER. — Rowaida Abdelaziz (@Rowaida_Abdel) October 31, 2017

To hear a spiritual phrase that Muslims use in their everyday lives twisted in this violent way is incredibly frustrating, said Rabiah Ahmed, director of media and public affairs at the Muslim Public Affairs Council. ″[Allahu Akbar] has been used in traditional Muslim prayers for centuries and is used as a peaceful reminder of their religious commitment. They are also the opening words of the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) and is also often used in approval in the same way Christians say Amen,'"" Ahmed told HuffPost. ""Its extremely painful and frustrating [to see it misused], and unfortunately, just another example of how our religion is co-opted by those those who act outside of it.""

John Moore via Getty Images A makeshift memorial stands on a bike path in lower Manhattan on November 1, 2017 in New York City. Eight people were killed and 12 injured on October 31 when suspect 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov intentionally drove a truck onto the path.

A Phrase With A Profound Spiritual History The phrase Allahu akbar has a long history of use within Islam. It expresses a sentiment that is at its heart a theological reflection about humanity's place in the world: That no matter what trials or victories people face, God is greater than it all. It appears a few times in the Quran, but only mid-sentence, according to Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. The phrase is more explicit in the sunnah, a set of teachings about the way of life modeled by Islam's founder, the Prophet Muhammad. Suleiman pointed in particular to a hadith ― one of the collected reports about the prophet ― where Muhammad is recorded as saying, ""Allah is Greater, Mightier than all His creation. He is Mightier than what I fear and dread."" ""What it suggests is that God is greater than all our concerns, God is greater than all that is ascribed to him, greater than all the disappointments we have,"" Suleiman said. ""God is greater than our pain, God is greater than our material possessions."" Allahu akbar is an affirmation of a belief in a monotheistic God, Suleiman said ― since it suggests that God has no partners. Belief in absolute monotheism is a core part of orthodox Islamic theology. The phrase Allahu akbar is also used by non-Muslim Arab speakers, since ""Allah"" is the Arabic word for God. Some Christians from Syria, Lebanon, and other regions in the Levant, say Allahu akbar to express surprise, excitement, puzzlement or dismay ― in the same way that English speakers may use the phrase ""Oh my God."" (It's not a religious pronouncement for these Christians, however, and some Arab Christians, such as Egypt's Copts, do not use it.) From a theological point of view, the idea that God is greater than human circumstances is not limited to Islam. In English, one verse of the Bible declares, ""He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."" A popular Christian worship song by the band MercyMe is based on the verse. Another wildly popular Christian song, by the musician Chris Tomlin, states, ""Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other."" Nick Jonas has a symbol representing the words ""God is greater than the highs and lows"" tattooed on his arm.

Saying Allahu Akbar In Prayer, Joy And Sadness For Muslims, the phrase Allahu akbar is built into the prayers that are one of the pillars of Islam. It begins the call to prayer, or ""adhan."" It's also used as a verbal transition between the different positions Muslims assume during prayer ― standing up, bowing, kneeling, prostrating on the ground. ""There's something extremely powerful about saying Allahu akbar and then prostrating yourself, putting your face on the ground in supplication to our creator,"" Suleiman said. ""In Islam, the greatest position of prayer is prostration ― the more you lower yourself to God, the higher he elevates you.""

Muslim Girl via Getty Images Muslims repeat Allahu akbar as a transition between different positions used during prayer.

Outside of the context of formal prayer, Allahu akbar is also used by Muslims in moments of celebration, such as when someone passes a hard exam or is accepted into college. It is also said in times of sorrow ― such as when a dearly loved one passes away. The phrase is often the first sound Muslims whisper into a baby's ears at birth and one of the last sounds they hear during a burial, as a body is lowered into the grave. Suleiman said that often during Islamic fundraisers, every time someone raises their hand to donate the whole audience will say Allahu akbar in celebration of the act of charity. The phrase is so much a part of daily life that Qasim Rashid, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in America, estimates that he's said it more than 1.6 million times over the course of his life ― just because of the five daily prayers. ""[Praying] five times a day, since I was about seven years old, it comes out to about 1.6 million times over the last 28 years or so,"" Rashid told HuffPost. ""That doesn't include when I said Allahu akbar when my kids were born, or when I helped build a hospital, or Michael Jordan made the game winning shot in the NBA finals."" ""It's part of our celebratory mode, and to believe that it could mean something violent is asinine,"" he said.

The Consequences Of Misusing The Phrase Despite the prevalence of this religious concept, Hind Makki, an interfaith educator and activist, told HuffPost said she feels that a stigma has become attached to the phrase in American culture ― particularly when it is said in Arabic. ""It's one of those Arabic phrases that people who aren't Muslim or aren't really familiar with Islam treat with dread because they connect it to a crime,"" she said. ""It's frustrating because we have seen how many mass shootings and mass murders there have been recently and several of the suspects, I would assume have some kind of ideological bent,"" she said, referring in particular to the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, whose rampage in October left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. ""But because the person is not from a Muslim background, or didn't yell Allahu akbar, people are like, 'We don't know why he did it.'"" Some Muslims have become wary of saying the phrase, or speaking in Arabic in general, while in public. The feeling of anxiety is felt heavily on planes, where some have reported being taken off flights for speaking in Arabic. Rashid said that as a result of how the phrase is treated in America, he tries to use it as much as possible around his children. ""I don't want them to feel intimidated. I feel young Muslims feel intimidated using words like jihad, or Allahu akbar, or even saying 'assalamu alaikum' [a common greeting] in public,"" he said. ""It's an unfortunate side effect of what's happening right now.""

Burhaan Kinu via Getty Images Allahu akbar is said during prayer and also in everyday conversations -- as an expression of celebration.

Another side effect of misusing and misunderstanding Islamic phrases is that it leads to fears of a backlash against the Muslim community. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased dramatically since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Allahu akbar has been weaponized in the past by people whose intent is to harm Muslims. In Quebec City, Canada in January, it was reportedly yelled out by a suspect with far-right, white nationalist views during a deadly attack on a mosque community. This summer, an Italian mayor threatened that anyone who shouts Allahu akbar in a main square in Venice would be immediately shot. Ahmed, of MPAC, said she believes every terrorist act done in the name of Islam not only takes away innocent lives but also threatens the security of Americans who are Muslim. ""Because there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding about our faith and community, those who seek revenge for these attacks will usually direct their anger toward the first innocent Muslim they see on the streets, at school, and at public places,"" she told HuffPost. ""Since 9/11, this has been our reality. Whenever there is any terror incident done in our name, we mourn not only as Americans, but we mourn the hijacking of our faith and brace ourselves for potential backlash."" That's why Ahmed believes education about Islam is crucial. Instead of allowing the Islamic State to define what Allahu akbar means, she said it's important to seek authentic, legitimate voices and interpretations of the phrase. ""When we allow [ISIS} to define Islam for the masses, we end up giving their twisted ideologies a platform and spread their hatred and fear,"" Ahmed said. ""The media and our government leaders have a lot of power in how it covers and responds to ISIS that can be harnessed to help achieve what we all want - the complete and utter defeat of ISIS and its ideology.""",Here's What You Need To Know About The Phrase 'Allahu Akbar',http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/02/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-phrase-allahu-akbar_a_23265255/

엘리자베스 2세 영국 여왕이 개인 회사를 통해 조세회피처에 거액을 투자 형태로 보관중인 사실이 확인됐다. 그밖에도 쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리, 윌버 로스 미국 상무장관, 렉스 틸러슨 국무장관, 재러드 쿠슈너 백악관 선임고문 같은 고위 정치인·정부 관계자들은 물론, U2 리드싱어 보노, 마돈나 같은 연예인들도 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루된 것으로 나타났다.

페이스북, 애플, 마이크로소프트, 나이키, 우버, 이베이, 맥도날드, 지멘스, 알리안츠 등 다국적 기업들도 목록에 포함됐다. 한국인 200여명과 한국인이 세운 법인 90여개도 있었다.





'파라다이스 페이퍼스'



What are the Paradise Papers? - The Guardian

이같은 사실은 5일(현지시각) 공개된 '파라다이스 페이퍼(Paradise Papers)'로 세상에 모습을 드러냈다. 1300만개가 넘는 파일로 이뤄진 이 방대한 유출 문건에는 세계 유명 인사와 기업들이 해외 조세피난처와 다국적 기업 등을 활용해 조세를 회피해 온 정황이 자세하게 담겨있다. 지난해 4월 공개됐던 '파나마 페이퍼스'와 유사하다.

유출된 문서 대부분은 버뮤다에 위치한 법률 자문회사 '애플비(Appleby)'에서 나왔다. 애플비는 전세계 조세도피처에 사무실을 두고 고객들에게 페이퍼컴퍼티 설립 등을 통한 조세 회피, 재산 은닉 등을 자문해왔다.

지난해 '파나마 페이퍼스'에 이어 이번에도 문건을 입수한 독일 일간지 '쥐트도이체차이퉁'은 국제탐사보도언론인협회(ICIJ)에 도움을 요청했다. 이에 따라 미국 뉴욕타임스, 영국 가디언, BBC 등 전 세계 언론사(67개국, 96개 언론사, 382명)들의 국제 공조 취재로 그 내용이 드러나게 됐다. 한국에서는 뉴스타파가 이 작업에 참여했다.

""지난 6개월 동안 방대한 데이터를 일일이 분석했다""는 뉴스타파에 따르면, 유출된 자료는 1950년~2016년 기간에 생산된 1343만여건(1.4TB)에 달한다.

물론 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루됐다는 것만으로 모두 '불법'이라고 단정할 수는 없다. 다만 통상 세금을 회피하기 위한 목적임이 분명한 경우가 많고 '검은 거래'를 숨기려는 의도로 조세회피처를 활용하는 사례가 상당하다. 도덕적 책임은 물론, 때에 따라서는 법적 책임을 피할 수 없게 될 가능성도 있다는 뜻이다.





등장인물들

각 언론사들은 분석 결과를 바탕으로 자료에 담긴 내용들을 보도하고 있다. 이 중 현재까지 주목할 만한 내용 중 하나는 바로 영국 여왕 엘리자베스 2세의 조세회피 의혹이다. 이전에는 한 번도 알려지지 않았던 내용이다.

가디언에 따르면, 엘리자베스 여왕은 캐이맨제도와 버뮤다에 개인 자산 약 1000만파운드(약 145억원)를 역외 투자 형태로 보관중인 것으로 나타났다.

이 과정에는 여왕의 자산을 관리하는 '랭커스터공국(Duchy of Lancaster·DL)'이 동원됐다. DL은 영국 최대 가전·생활용품 임대 전문 소매점 '브라이트하우스' 등에 펀드 형태로 투자를 하고 있는 것으로 나타났다.

왕실 측은 이같은 투자로 세금을 회피한 사실이 없다고 해명했다. 그러나 가디언은 왕실의 재정 운영 상황을 보다 투명하게 공개하라는 요구가 다시 빗발칠 가능성이 높다고 전했다.

쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리도 간접적으로 등장한다. 정치자금 모금을 담당한 최측근인 스티븐 브론프맨이 가족 투자기업을 통해 캐이맨제도와 이스라엘, 미국 등에 복잡한 법인 거래 관계를 설립해뒀다는 것. 가디언은 이 법인들 사이의 거래를 통해 그가 '합법적'으로 세금을 회피했을 가능성이 있다고 전했다.

윌버 로스 미국 상무장관 등 트럼프 정부 고위 관계자들의 이름도 다수 등장한다. 특히 로스 장관은 푸틴의 사위인 키릴 샤말로프와 러시아 기업인들이 공동으로 소유한 에너지기업 '시부르'와 계약을 맺었던 것으로 드러났다. 여기에는 미국 정부가 제재 대상으로 분류한 이들도 포함되어 있다.

그밖에도 U2의 보노가 몰타를 경유해 리투아니아의 대형 쇼핑몰을 비밀리에 소유하고 있던 사실 등이 드러났다.

한편 뉴스타파는 ""현재까지 한국인 232명의 이름을 찾아냈다""고 전했다. 또 ""이들 한국인이 조세도피처에 세운 법인은 모두 90개로 나타났""으며, ""코스닥 상장기업같은 중견업체부터 가스공사같은 공기업, 그리고 재벌기업도 적지 않게 발견됐다""고 덧붙였다.

Στο ναό αυτό πήγαιναν περιστασιακά τα πεθερικά του για προσευχηθούν, όπως έγινε γνωστό από αξιωματούχους.

Η επίθεση αυτή είναι η τελευταία μιας σειράς αιματηρών περιστατικών που συγκλονίζουν τις ΗΠΑ. Πρόκειται επίσης για την πλέον πολύνεκρη επίθεση στο Τέξας.

Ο δράστης, ο 26χρονος Ντέβιν Πάτρικ Κέλεϊ εισήλθε στην εκκλησία των Βαπτιστών στο Σάδερλαντ Σπρινγκς κρατώντας μια ημιαυτόματη καραμπίνα και ντυμένος στα μαύρα, κατόπιν άνοιξε πυρ ενώ βρισκόταν σε εξέλιξη η κυριακάτικη λειτουργία. Τραυμάτισε τουλάχιστον 20 ανθρώπους.

Στην εκκλησία των Βαπτιστών το Σάδερλαντ Σπρινγκς, μια μικρή ξύλινη εκκλησία σαν αυτές που συναντά κανείς διάσπαρτες στις ΗΠΑ, συνήθιζαν να πηγαίνουν οι γονείς της συζύγου ή πρώην συζύγου του δράστη, επισήμαναν οι αρχές, υπονοώντας ένα πιθανό κίνητρο της επίθεσης.

«Γνωρίζουμε ότι τα πρώην πεθερικά του ή πεθερικά του σύχναζαν κατά καιρούς σε αυτήν την εκκλησία. Δεν βρίσκονταν εκεί χθες και δεν γνωρίζουμε γιατί πήγε εκεί τη συγκεκριμένη ημέρα» τόνισε ο σερίφης.

Ο κυβερνήτης του Τέξας Γκρεγκ Άμποτ δήλωσε στο CBS, αφού επισκέφθηκε τον τόπο της τραγωδίας, ότι ο ναός «δεν επελέγη κατά τύχη».

«Είμαι βέβαιος ότι υπάρχει κάποια σχέση με αυτήν την εκκλησία, μια σχέση που θα αποσαφηνιστεί τις επόμενες ημέρες» συμπλήρωσε.

Ο Κέλεϊ αυτοκτόνησε αφού επιχείρησε να διαφύγει από το σημείο του μακελειού, είπε επιπλέον ο σερίφης της κομητείας.

Τον κυνήγησαν δύο άνδρες με το φορτηγάκι τους, κατόπιν το αυτοκίνητό του εξετράπη της πορείας του και ακριβώς εκείνη τη στιγμή ο σερίφης πιστεύει πως εκείνος επέλεξε να βάλει τέλος στη ζωή του με ένα περίστροφο.

«Σημειώθηκε ανταλλαγή πυροβολισμών, πιστεύω, ενώ βρίσκονταν στον δρόμο, κατόπιν συνέβη το ατύχημα. Έφερε τραύμα από σφαίρα, το οποίο προκάλεσε ο ίδιος» εξήγησε ο σερίφης Τζο Τάκιτ στο τηλεοπτικό δίκτυο CBS.

Μεταξύ των νεκρών ήταν η 14χρονη κόρη του πάστορα Φρανκ Πόμεροϊ, ανέφερε η οικογένεια σε τηλεοπτικούς σταθμούς.

«Αντιμετωπίζουμε τη μεγαλύτερη μαζική ένοπλη επίθεση στην ιστορία της πολιτείας μας» είπε ο κυβερνήτης του Τέξας, Γκρεγκ Άμποτ, στη συνέντευξη Τύπου. «Η τραγωδία φυσικά επιδεινώνεται από το γεγονός ότι έλαβε χώρα σε εκκλησία, έναν χώρο λατρείας όπου αθώοι έπεσαν νεκροί από πυρά».

«Δεν πιστεύουμε πως είχε κάποια σύνδεση με αυτή την εκκλησία» είπε στο CNN ο σερίφης Τζο Τάκιτ. «Δεν έχουμε κίνητρο».

Hay muchas maneras de enfrentar a los trolls que se dedican a esparcir mensajes de odio en internet. Lexie Manion, una activista del movimiento Body Positive (aceptación corporal), lo abordó de una manera distinta: se dedicó a hacerle cumplidos a quienes le enviaron comentarios de odio en una fotografía que publicó recientemente. La joven de 22 años recibió una serie de comentarios repugnantes sobre su cuerpo y su peso, luego de compartir una foto a principios de octubre, según escribió en Cosmo UK. En respuesta a la noción equivocada de que las mujeres de talla extra sólo se sienten realmente cómodas con sus cuerpos si usan ropa reveladora, Lexie publicó retratos suyos con un top transparente y una sudadera, en la descripción explicaba que se sentía cómoda y confiada con ambos outfits.

A post shared by Lexie (@lexiemanion) on Oct 6, 2017 at 5:50pm PDT

Como mujer, siento mucha presión diaria de verme presentable y bien vestida. Y, como mujer de talla extra, esa presión es mayor ahora que cuando era de talla normal. Creo que en parte eso se debe a que hay mujeres de talla extra que esconden sus cuerpos bajo prendas amplias por mucho tiempo, ya sea porque nos da pena exponer nuestros cuerpos, o porque no teníamos a la mano ropa que nos gustara y nos quedara. Ambas ideas se deben al juicio de la gente. Yo ya tengo en contra un strike por salir a la calle siendo una gorda; la gente me barre o me mira con pena ajena. Un segundo strike en mi contra ocurre cuando no me puedo vestir bien. En este mundo hay una enorme preocupación por la imagen, así que algunas veces tenemos que actuar con base en esa presión. Como soy una mujer, si no me maquillo, me dicen que me veo ""enferma"" o ""cansada"" y hasta ""fea. Como mujer, si me pongo un outfit sencillo y cómodo, quiere decir que no me ""esfuerzo lo suficiente"". Y como mujer de talla extra, si me pongo ropa cómoda, me ven como si ""no me esforzara"", pero más aún me juzgan por ser gorda. Para mucha gente, ser gorda equivale a ser floja/no saludable/asquerosa. Así que me llega otro strike por sus prejuicios, de que un determinado día no le eché ganitas por cómo me vestí. Y ahora resulta que, al haber aceptado mi cuerpo de gorda, la gente también espera que siempre me ponga ropa atrevida. Por eso ahora les digo que ¡al diablo con las reglas! Si quieres andar fodonga (y así ando, los días en que no quiero resaltar), eso no debe restar confianza o valor. No tienes que lucir siempre como si quisieras que te dieran un 10. Lo que importa es que te sientas un 10, o que le eches ganas para ganarte esa calificación (¡pues mereces sentirte bien por ti misma!). Podremos tener días en que no nos queremos maquillar, o ponernos ropa pegada, u outfits más arriesgados. Pero eso no quiere decir que nos odiamos o que finjamos sentirnos con confianza todo el tiempo. Simplemente no importa porque no tiene importancia. Una no está obligada a llevar ropa reveladora, o ponerse menos prendas, o ponerse cosas entalladas (¡a menos que así lo quieras!) para probar tu confianza o que aceptas tu cuerpo. La confianza no tiene que ver sólo con cómo nos vemos, también tiene que ver con la manera en que hablamos y en cómo nos tratamos a nosotros mismos y a los demás. Cuando Lexie empezó a recibir los mensajes de usuarios que respondían a su postura con palabras de odio, primero pensó en poner su cuenta como privada, luego en bloquear a los trolls y finalmente en contestarle a cada uno. En su artículo escribió que seguía sintiéndose frustrada e ""impotente""; sin embargo, empezó a enviarles mensajes directos con cumplidos ""genuinos"", sobre algo tan simple como sus sonrisas o sus outfits. ""A pesar de que no tenía muchas expectativas, esperaba que ellos se sintieran forzados a reconocer que habían trolleado a una persona auténtica y con sentimientos, y que eso los inspirara a pensar dos veces la próxima vez que fueran a molestarme a mi o a otra persona"", escribió.

Antes le daba la vueltas al argumento de que sólo quería 'glorificar la gordura'. Esas palabras me apenaban porque me hacían cuestionar lo que hacía. '¿Estoy compartiendo un mensaje de algo que me da orgullo? ¿Está bien lo que hago?'. Y, a fin de cuentas, '¿estoy glorificando la gordura?'. Ahora me doy cuenta de que sí estoy glorificando la gordura. Y lo digo con orgullo y no escondiendo mi cara por la pena. Si esto les ofende, piensen en esto: Estoy enferma, pero, ¿eso qué tiene que ver con mi propio valor como persona? Es probable que les tome un tiempo desaprender lo que les han enseñado, o quizá no tengan la voluntad para ello, pero para mí, el peso no tiene nada que ver con el valor de una misma. Soy, relativamente, una buena persona; no me dedico a ofender a los demás y, si así fuera, les ofrezco disculpas; les envío mi amor. Yo me dedico a echarle ganas para ser saludable mental y físicamente. Soy una buena amiga, soy compasiva... Y, sí, sucede que soy una gorda. Entonces, ¿por qué mi apariencia les preocupa mucho a ustedes, extraños, que no me conocen y que no les interesa mi bienestar o algo de mí más que mi perfil en las redes sociales? ¿Por qué atacan todas mis cualidades cuando se dan cuenta de mi imagen? Para mí, ustedes tienen su valor, son buenas personas y merecen cosas buenas. También creo que el mostrarme así y vivir libremente a pesar de las críticas es algo revolucionario. Mostrarse valiente en un cuerpo con gordura en esta época es algo valiente, puesto que vivimos en una sociedad que avergüenza y deshumaniza a quienes estamos 'demasiado gordos'. Nos ven siempre como indignos e inútiles. Así que por ello vamos a retomar el poder y demostrar que nuestro valor lo significa todo. Confrontar los estándares de belleza y el sistema actual que evita que los gordos vivamos libremente es una revolución. Espero que eso se elimine algún día. Espero que un día dejemos que todos vivan como quieran, y se enfoquen en quienes somos como personas. Y ese día, es hoy. Así que aquí me tienen. Glorifico la obesidad. También glorifico ser más saludable, física y mentalmente, algo en lo cual trabajo duramente, tanto en el gimnasio como en mi terapia. Y estoy orgullosa de glorificar el amor y no el odio. Lexie dijo que sólo recibió ""un puñado"" de respuestas a sus cumplidos, y que quienes se tomaron la molestia de escribir ya no lo hicieron con odio. ""Esto me llevó a pensar que provoqué cierto impacto, al tiempo que me ayudó a sobrellevar la situación de una manera en que sentí auténtica"", escribió. Manion le dijo al HuffPost que hacer estos cumplidos al principio fue un reto, pero luego se fue haciendo más fácil. Un comentario fue especialmente revelador. ""Le escribí a una chica que me había comentado: 'Qué asco. Sigo asqueada'"". Le respondí diciéndole que me encantaba cómo se deletrea su nombre, que era único y bonito.

Lo cual es algo muy diferente a decir las cosas de frente"". No hay una manera exitosa de manejar a los trolls, pero la ciencia sugiere que el método de Lexie tiene beneficios. En un estudio de 2010 que se publicó en el Journal of Social Psychology se probó el impacto que los actos de amabilidad tienen en la felicidad propia. Para ello, se dividió a los participantes en tres grupos durante diez días; uno incurrió en actos diarios de amabilidad, otro probó algo nuevo cada día, y el tercero no tuvo instrucciones. La gente que probó algo nuevo o que realizó actos de amabilidad ""experimentó un enorme empujón en sus niveles de felicidad"". En el tercer grupo no se registraron cambios en sus actitudes.

Anoche salí a pasear a mis perros con mi mamá. Esos paseos son de 1 kilómetro y medio. Se ha vuelto muy difícil entrenar todo ese tiempo de un jalón, pero es un logro para mí, aunque mi espalda baja me duela, y me agote y se me acabe el aire. Mi meta es llegar a completar la caminata con poco dolor, o sin que me duela, y que no me cueste trabajo hacerlo. Y, por cierto, incluso cuando estaba esbelta también estaba fuera de forma, por lo que siendo flaca tampoco es como que estuviera sana. Estar delgado no siempre significa que estés sano. En términos de fuerza y habilidad, no estaba en mejor forma física cuando era talla 10 que ahora, que soy talla 24. Así que... Mientras me recupero de mi desorden alimenticio, jamás me impondré una meta que tenga que ver con mi peso o mi talla. Ahora tengo un mejor control sobre mi propia vida y mi camino, el cual puede tener menos que ver con cifras, lo cual significa que tengo más libertad. Estoy basando mi salud y recuperación en cómo me siento, mental, emocional o físicamente. Luego del paseo de anoche, llegué a casa y me puse a llorar. No sé por qué. Creo que tiene que ver con la forma en que contengo las emociones... Eso es algo en lo que me concentro para desaprender cada día. A lo mejor sentirme mejor físicamente provoca que mi cuerpo se dé cuenta de que estaba aferrada a cosas que me lastimaban emocionalmente. Aunque no me gusta llorar, y aunque no me gusta caminar casi dos kilómetros, me siento mejor luego de esas dos experiencias. Pero eso no quiere decir que el ejercicio le alivie la depresión y las cosas negativas a todo el mundo. Tampoco quiere decir que sea la solución de todas las cosas. Ponerme en forma no va a arreglarlo todo. Tengo que seguir trabajando en muchos aspectos de mi vida. Y siempre habrá cosas que no pueda controlar. Sin embargo, si elijo por mí misma y si aprendo a pedir ayuda y escucho lo que me dicen mi mente y mi cuerpo, creo que estaré dando pasos en la dirección correcta. No creo que sean los pasos definitivos, pero sí son una pieza en este rompecabezas. Moraleja: No necesitas cambiar de la noche a la mañana. Y, en realidad, ni siquiera es que tengas que cambiar. Más bien, puedes crecer. Así que hay que echarle ganas para llegar a tu meta y crecer con el apoyo de quienes te rodean. Podrás hacerlo"". ""El éxito de los ""actos amables"" podría deberse al elemento potencial de la adopción novedosa de los efectos neutralizantes"", escribieron Anat Bardi, profesora del Royal Holloway, de la Universidad de Londres, y Kathryn E. Buchanan, de la Universidad de Essex, autores del estudio. ""De igual manera, los participantes del estudio que realizaron cinco actos de amabilidad diarios durante una semana tuvieron un mayor incremento en su felicidad que aquellos que realizaron cinco actos durante una semana, probablemente porque realizar los actos de manera frecuente los llevó a adaptarse más rápidamente"", Lexie, quien comparte abiertamente su desorden alimenticio, recibió enormes muestras de amor de sus simpatizantes en las redes sociales. Ella escribió en Instagram que ese apoyo es, en parte, lo que la anima a seguir posteando.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Frauen beweisen Freude am Fahren, parken fluchend doch perfekt ein und beschäftigen sich durchaus mit ihren Autos. Doch für jeden Fahrer und jede Fahrerin gilt: Nur mit einer guten Kfz-Versicherung fährt es sich auf Nummer sicher. Die Kfz-Versicherung der Allianz ist als zuverlässiger Partner immer mit am Steuer. Trotz günstiger Tarife setzt der Versicherer vor allem auf ein umfangreiches Service- und Leistungsangebot.

Rund 4000 Demonstranten versammelten sich um einen Kohlebagger

Bei der Auflösung der Proteste kam es zu gewalttätigen Szenen

Sonntag in Buir, etwas mehr als 50 Kilometer von Bonn entfernt. Tausende Aktivisten der zivilgesellschaftlichen Initiative Ende Gelände treffen sich, um symbolisch zur Klimakonferenz in Bonn in die Grube zu gehen. Ein Kohlebagger des Energiekonzerns RWE soll besetzt werden.

Am Ende kommt es zu gewalttätigen Szenen: Polizisten reiten in friedliche Demonstranten in einem mondartig-anmutenden Niemandsland. Eine junge Frau wird erst von einem Polizisten umgeworfen, dann trampelt ein Pferd auf ihren Torso, während sie schreiend auf dem Bauch liegt.

Was als friedliche Demonstration geplant war, wird zu einem chaotischen Ereignis.

Proteste für den Kohleausstieg vor Klimakonferenz Cop23

Hintergrund der Proteste: Vom 6. bis 17. November trifft sich in der ehemaligen Bundeshauptstadt die UN zur 23. Klimakonferenz. Das Interesse an der Konferenz ist groß, seit Donald Trump vor wenigen Monaten das Aussteigen der USA aus dem Klimaabkommen ankündigte.

Bereits am Samstag den 4. November kam es zu Protesten. Mehrere tausend Menschen fuhren mit dem Fahrrad von Köln nach Bonn, um ein Zeichen zu setzen. In Bonn trafen sich dann laut Veranstalter mehr als 25.000 Menschen auf den Straßen und demonstrierten für eine Klimawende und speziell den Kohleausstieg.

Mit dabei bereits hier: Das Bündnis Ende Gelände, das für Sonntag zu einer symbolischen Aktion im Hambacher Tagebau aufgerufen hatte. Ein Kohlebagger des Betreibers RWE sollte besetzt werden.

Am Sonntag kamen so schließlich mehr als 4000 Menschen in das Dorf Buir. Mit Staubmasken, Strohballen, Bannern und Gesang ging es in Richtung Grube. Zahlreiche internationale Demonstranten beteiligten sich an der Aktion - darunter viele Franzosen.

Quelle: Michael Trammer

Elen, eine ältere Aktivistin aus Frankreich, erklärte: Die Menschen hier sind für eine Durchsetzung des Pariser Klimaabkommens. Mit Präsident Emmanuel Macron mache Frankreich Rückschritte bei der Klimapolitik. Zusammengefasst müsse man laut Elen sagen: ""Die Cop21 in Paris war ein kompletter Reinfall! Darauf müssen wir aufmerksam machen!“

Proteste für den Kohleausstieg vor Klimakonferenz Cop23

Ein Aktivist aus Argentinien, der lieber als ""Mr. Green“ bezeichnet werden will, erklärte seine Motivation, sich an den Protesten zu beteiligen, mit einem einfachen Wunsch: Er wünscht sich den Ausstieg aus der Kohlkraft.

Für ""Mr. Green"" steht außer Frage: Pazifistischer Widerstand ist seine Aktionsform. Die Polizei sei nicht sein Feind und es dürfe ganz klar niemand bei den Protesten zu Schaden kommen.

Auch laut Veranstaltern ist der gemeinsame Nenner, auf den sich alle Gruppen des Bündnis für diese Aktion geeinigt hätten, ganz klar pazifistisch: Die symbolische Blockade stehe im Vordergrund. Weder RWE-Anlagen, noch Mitarbeiter oder Polizisten sollten zu Schaden kommen.

Am Bagger in der Grube angekommen herrscht somit zunächst eine entspannte Stimmung. Es waren zwar Gräben ausgehoben und Wälle aufgeschüttet worden, um den Tagebau unzugänglich zu machen – die Polizei schritt zunächst jedoch kaum ein, um das Treiben zu stoppen.

Quelle: Michael Trammer

Verzweifelt versuchten noch manche Beamte, die 30 Zentimeter tief im aufgeschütteten Sand standen, einzelne Aktivisten zu fangen.

Pressesprecher von Ende Gelände: ""Ich werte den heutigen Tag als großen Erfolg""

Der Pressesprecher von Ende Gelände stellte deshalb schon zu diesem Zeitpunkt fest: ""Ich werte den heutigen Tag als großen Erfolg. Es waren deutlich mehr Aktivisten vor Ort, als wir erwartet haben.""

Dem Bündnis sei es gelungen, die Grube zu betreten und sogar einen Kohlebagger zum Stoppen zu bringen. Dass der Bagger vor Ankunft der Aktivisten wirklich im Vollbetrieb lief, ist allerdings zu bezweifeln. Betreiber RWE hatte – zu sehen an den getroffenen Vorbereitungen – mit einer Aktion genau an diesem Bagger gerechnet und diesen wohl schon frühzeitig außer Betrieb genommen.

Quelle: Michael Trammer

Dennoch: Die Demonstranten hatten alleine durch die Präsenz in der Grube einen Förderungsstopp erzwungen. Dann aber schritt die Polizei ein.

Polizisten reiten junge Frau nieder

Im Vorfeld der Demonstration hatte Dirk Weinspach, der Polizeipräsident von Achen, gesagt: ""Das Wichtigste ist mir, dass am Ende der Protestaktion weder Kolleginnen und Kollegen, noch Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten oder Unbeteiligte zu Schaden gekommen sind.“

De Polizei zeigte NRW dann aber ein anderes Gesicht. Mit einsetzendem Regen zog eine Pferdestaffel auf. Unter Einsatz von Pfefferspray und dem Umreiten von Aktivisten versuchten die Beamten, den Kreis der Demonstranten zu zerstreuen.

Quelle: Michael Trammer

Journalisten wurden mit Pfefferspray attackiert, der Einsatz des Schlagstock angedroht. So sagte ein junger Beamter zu einem Reporter, dieser solle sich ""verpissen"", sonst gäbe es ""auf die Fresse"". Besonders unschön war eine Szene, als eine junge Aktivistin von einem Polizisten erst brutal zu Boden gestossen wurde und dann ein Pferd auf ihren Oberkörper trampelte.

Die Polizistin auf dem Pferd rief danach noch: ""Das war keine Absicht!“ Von der Pressestelle der Polizei NRW war in der unmittelbaren Nähe der Aktion leider kein Ansprechpartner zu finden, um ein Statement zu den Vorkommnissen einzuholen.

Polizei NRW kündigt an, Einsatz von Pfefferspray zu untersuchen

Später bestätigte die Polizei NRW jedoch auf Twitter, dass es sowohl zu der Verletzung einer Person durch eines der Polizeipferde, als auch zu einem Einsatz von Pfefferspray gekommen sei.

Zuvor hatte die Polizei die Echtheit von Bildern eben jenes Einsatzes auf Twitter angezweifelt - nur, um sie später doch als echt zu bezeichnen.

Echtheit der Bilder Pfeffersprayeinsatz nicht geklärt - Ersteller bitte mit weiteren Bildern melden - Prüfung erfolgt durch #Polizei #Aachen — Polizei NRW AC (@Polizei_NRW_AC) 5. November 2017

Zum Ende wurde die Demonstration aufgelöst und Aktivisten in Busse der RWE-Power-AG verladen. Über Lautsprecher kündigte ein Beamter einen einstündigen Transport auf ein Revier an. Die Besetzung des Kraftwerks wurde beendet, der friedliche Protest von Ende Gelände beendet.

Am Ende überschattete Gewalt, was als politisches Signal an die Vereinten Nationen und für den Ausstieg aus dem Kohleabbau gedacht war.

54.000. C'est le nombre de femmes nouvellement touchées par le cancer du sein chaque année en France. Cette forme de cancer est non seulement la plus fréquente, mais aussi la première cause de décès par cancer chez les femmes1.

Pourtant, seule la moitié des Français et des Françaises déclarent être correctement informés sur cette maladie (1). En 2017, à une époque où il n'a jamais été aussi facile d'avoir accès à l'information, près de 50 % de la population demeure paradoxalement dans le flou. Les causes principales: la circulation de nombreuses idées reçues sur le cancer du sein et le dépistage et la peur de souffrir qui devient paralysante. Alors, comment pallier ces déséquilibres et œuvrer pour une lutte encore plus efficace contre le cancer du sein? En prolongeant Octobre Rose (2) et toutes les actions entreprises pour combattre la maladie. Pour Europa Donna, toute l'année doit être rose et pas seulement le mois d'octobre.

Manque d'informations, sentiment de solitude, peur paralysante: il faut changer cette équation!

La lutte contre le cancer du sein ne s'arrête pas aux frontières d'octobre: c'est tous les jours que des milliers de femmes doivent faire face à cette maladie. Il est donc essentiel de prendre conscience des efforts à réaliser en termes de diffusion d'informations fiables liées au cancer du sein. Notre rôle, en tant qu'association de patientes, est de veiller à un accès à l'ensemble des informations nécessaires pour prévenir, accompagner et guérir la maladie. À travers chacune de nos actions, nous œuvrons pour une meilleure diffusion de tous les traitements possibles, de la meilleure façon de se repérer dans le parcours médical et de mieux connaître toutes les démarches préventives à effectuer.

Aussi, nous voulons rappeler avec ferveur l'importance du dépistage contre la maladie, à l'instar des recommandations de la HAS qui proposent un dépistage tous les deux ans pour les femmes à partir de 50 ans jusqu'à 74 ans, et de façon plus précoce pour les femmes qui présentent des facteurs de risque importants. Une large majorité des Français est consciente des vertus d'un dépistage précoce: il faut continuer à encourager cela! Mais il n'en demeure pas moins que la méfiance persiste concernant certaines caractéristiques du dépistage. Nous devons nous battre contre les idées reçues, car elles constituent un frein qui n'a pas lieu d'exister. Redisons-le haut et fort: le cancer du sein tue encore trop de femmes (11.000 décès par an) et la détection d'un cancer du sein par un professionnel de santé à un stade précoce permet d'augmenter les chances de survie! (La survie à 5 ans est de 99 % pour un cancer du sein détecté à un stade précoce, elle est de 26 % pour un cancer métastasé). La maladie se soigne ainsi plus facilement et les séquelles liées à certains traitements sont diminuées.

À ce combat contre la maladie s'ajoutent également la peur et le sentiment de solitude. Que les patientes soient seules ou soutenues par leurs proches, le cancer du sein isole et entame la pleine capacité à être reconnue en tant que sujet. Pour affronter la solitude et permettre à ces femmes de se sentir à nouveau considérées, nous devons poursuivre notre devoir d'information et d'accompagnement. Un travail sur la représentation du cancer du sein et de ses traitements, une communication plus rassurante sur les bénéfices du dépistage doivent être les sujets clés du développement de notre lutte.

Défendre, informer, échanger: la devise du combat contre le cancer du sein

Plus que jamais, il s'agit d'être auprès des patientes. Il en va de la responsabilité de tous et toutes : associations de patients, professionnels de santé, laboratoires de recherches, pouvoirs publics, médias, partenaires industriels. Nous sommes tous capables, à notre niveau, d'activer un levier dans ce combat. Nous devons veiller à:

Défendre l'intérêt et les droits des femmes et garantir l'accès à des soins de qualité. Informer en utilisant tous les canaux de diffusion: sur les sites Internet des associations de patients, sur les sites gouvernementaux, par les médias, par l'organisation de colloques supportés par des professionnels et des associations reconnues. Échanger et accompagner les femmes et leurs proches. À titre d'exemple, Europa Donna France organise dans plusieurs délégations tous les mois le « Café Donna », un moment convivial pour échanger avec les patientes et leur entourage.

Grâce aux actions des membres d'Europa Donna France, ce sont près de 10 000 personnes qui ont été aidées dans leur lutte contre la maladie. Mais c'est encore trop peu. Il reste beaucoup à entreprendre pour convaincre les femmes de se faire accompagner.

Le cancer du sein ne touche pas qu'une femme : il touche aussi une famille, des amis et des collègues. C'est votre femme, votre sœur, votre voisine, votre amie qui souffre ou souffrira d'un cancer du sein. Alors soyons toutes et tous les acteurs de ce combat !

Das behauptete die Anwältin in einem Interview in Moskau

Es könnte ein Paukenschlag sein. Im Fall der Verstrickung des Wahlkampfteams von US-Präsident Donald Trump mit dem Kreml hat die russische Anwältin Natalia Veselnitskaya brisante Informationen veröffentlicht.

So soll Donald Jr. ihr versprochen haben, ein 2012 von der Obama-Regierung eingeführtes Gesetz zurückzunehmen, das russischen Staatsbeamten Sanktionen auferlegt. Das berichtet die Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg mit Verweis auf ein Interview der Anwältin in Moskau.

""Falls wir an die Macht kommen...""

Das Versprechen soll Trump Jr. bei einem viel zitierten Treffen am 9. Juni 2016 in New York geäußert haben. Ebenfalls anwesend: Trumps Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und der damalige Kampagnen-Manager Paul Manafort. Letzterer hatte sich Ende Oktober nach monatelangen Ermittlungen gegen ihn dem FBI gestellt. Manafort wird unter anderem Verschwörung gegen die USA vorgeworfen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schlüsselfigur in der Russland-Affäre: Wer ist George Papadopoulos - und wie gefährlich ist er für Trump?

Nach eigener Aussage reiste Veselnitskaya unter anderem mit dem Ziel nach New York, sich für das Ende der amerikanischen Sanktionen gegen Russland einzusetzen. Darum ging es auch beim Treffen im Trump Tower am 9. Juni. ""Falls wir an die Macht kommen, werden wir uns anschauen, was wir diesbezüglich unternehmen können"", soll Trump Jr. der Anwältin geantwortet haben.

Veselnitskaya ging nach eigener Aussage allerdings nicht im offiziellen Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die Gespräche.

Treffen war Zeitverschwendung

Im Gegenzug wollte der Präsidentensohn Unterlagen, die belegen, dass Hillary Clintons Wahlkampagne veruntreute Gelder bezogen hat. Geldgeber der Demokraten sollen bei den Steuern getrickst haben und diese Gelder an Hillary Clinton gespendet haben. Eine Information, die der britische Publizist Rob Goldstone Trump Jr. zuvor in einer E-Mail übermittelt hatte – im Namen Veselnitskayas.

Mit diesen konnte die Anwältin aber nicht dienen. Trump Jr. bezeichnete das Treffen darum im Nachhinein als Zeitverschwendung.

Veselnitskaya sicherte zu, die brisanten Informationen über das Gespräch auch unter Eid an den US-Sonderermittler Robert Mueller weiterzugeben, wenn es verlangt werde. Damit würde der Druck auf Donald Trump massiv wachsen – eine illegitime Absprache mit der russischen Regierung im Wahlkampf wäre wohl nur noch schwer mehr von der Hand zu weisen.

Voici 10 choses à connaître sur l'important projet de transport en commun.

29

C'est le nombre de stations que compterait à terme la ligne promise. Cette nouvelle branche de transport en commun relierait Lachine à Montréal-Nord, en passant par le centre-ville.

4

La ligne rose croiserait quatre fois des stations permettant aux passagers de changer de rame. Sur la ligne orange, les usagers pourraient permuter aux stations Mont-Royal et Vendôme, ils auraient également la possibilité de transférer à la Place-des-Arts sur la verte et à la nouvelle station qui verra le jour grâce au prolongement de la ligne bleue, à l'est de Saint-Michel. Finalement, la ligne rose communiquerait également avec deux gares intermodales, à Ville-Marie et à Vendôme.

22

C'est le nombre de minutes estimées pour relier Montréal-Nord au centre-ville, selon les calculs de la Chaire mobilité de Polytechnique. Toujours selon la chaire, ce serait 10 minutes du Vieux-Rosemont et 17 minutes de Lachine pour se rendre au centre-ville.

521 000

Les citoyens pourraient être nombreux à utiliser cette nouvelle option de transport en commun. Pas moins de 521 000 Montréalais habiteraient à une distance de marche d'une station de la ligne rose.

26 millions

C'est le nombre d'heures que les automobilistes montréalais perdent chaque année sur le réseau routier de l'île. Projet Montréal soutient que la congestion routière coûte jusqu'à 2,5 G$ par année à la Ville.

1988

La fin des années 1980 a coïncidé avec le dernier grand projet de métro sur l'île de Montréal à ce jour. C'est en 1988 que la ligne bleue a été complétée à la station Snowdon, qui était en fonction depuis 1981, faisant partie de la ligne orange. Il y a certes eu le prolongement de la ligne orange annoncé en 2002 et complété en 2007, mais les stations se trouvent sur l'île de Laval.

6 G$... ou 25 G$?

Projet Montréal estime que les travaux peuvent s'effectuer pour une somme de 6 G$. Le parti croit que le tronçon menant à Lachine serait moins coûteux que le reste, puisqu'il emprunterait les rails du Canadien National (CN). Des chiffres qui ont été lourdement critiqués par Denis Coderre lors de la campagne électorale. «Le problème c'est que la ligne rose, on nous dit que ça va coûter 6G$ mais c'est pas ça. J'ai dit que ça va coûter au moins 10 G$, mais c'est 15, 20, 25 G$», avait-il avancé en entrevue avec le HuffPost Québec. L'ex-maire jugeait les chiffres avancés par ses opposants «irréalistes». Valérie Plante avait rétorqué que son plan financier était basé sur divers projets de transport en commun lourd au Canada, aux États-Unis et en Europe, notamment les nouvelles lignes de métro de Barcelone et Paris. Projet Montréal soutient que chaque kilomètre de la ligne rose coûtera environ 250 M$.

3

Le projet de construction sera échelonné en trois phases, soit une période d'étude et de planification, ensuite une première phase de construction reliant Montréal-Nord au centre-ville, et finalement le prolongement jusqu'à Lachine.

La technique du «grand tunnelier»

Cette technologie, utilisée à Paris et Barcelone, permet de percer un tunnel unique avec des rails superposés, plutôt que de percer un tunnel par direction ou d'ouvrir les rues de Montréal. C'est grâce à cette technique que Projet Montréal estime être en mesure de garder les coûts somme toute bas.

La bonne solution pour désengorger Montréal?

Pas selon une experte jointe par le HuffPost Québec à la fin octobre. Paula Negron, directrice de l'Observatoire de la mobilité durable, croit que ni la ligne rose, ni le Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM), ne sauraient régler les problèmes les plus criants. Elle soutient que la majeure partie de la problématique repose sur le manque de transport en commun dans les endroits excentrés. «Se rendre de Montréal-Nord à Saint-Laurent en transport en commun, c'est l'enfer. Pourtant, Saint-Laurent est un pôle d'emploi important», dit-elle.

IPHONE - Apple a-t-il remporté son pari avec l'iPhone X? Disponible en pré-commande depuis le 27 octobre, le nouvel iPhone est arrivé en boutique ce 3 novembre. En attendant de connaître les estimations des ventes, la bourse semble déjà penser que oui.

A l'ouverture du marché américain, 15h à Paris, l'action du groupe a gagné d'un coup plus de 4%. Sur un groupe dont la capitalisation boursière frôle les 900 milliards de dollars, cela représente tout de même un gain d'une quarantaine de milliards, que les actionnaires peuvent se partager.

Peu après l'ouverture des marchés, la fièvre est retombée d'un cran, mais la hausse restait supérieure à 2% sur les coups de 16h. Et pour cause, les files d'attente interminables ont fait leur retour devant les Apple Store, une peu partout dans le monde, signe encourageant du succès commercial.

Ce n'est pas un hasard. Dans un récent communiqué, Apple encourageait les acheteurs à ""arriver tôt"" pour l'ouverture des magasins, à l'exception de la France et de la Belgique. Pour les 10 ans de l'iPhone, Apple a voulu renouer avec l'effet de masse.

Apple, qui a vu ses ventes baisser pour la première fois depuis dix ans en 2016, a besoin que l'iPhone X soit un carton. Les versions 8 et 8 Plus, sorties fin septembre, n'ont pas l'air d'intéresser les foules, si l'on en croit Joe Natale, le PDG de Rogers Communications, plus gros opérateur téléphonique du Canada. ""Ce que l'on voit, c'est une sorte d'appétit anémique pour l'iPhone 8"", a-t-il déclaré à CBC.

Selon le journal chinois Economic Daily News cité par ZDnet, Apple envisagerait de réduire de 50% la production d'iPhone 8 et 8 Plus. Mi-octobre, Reuters citait d'autres sources et analystes affirmant que l'iPhone 7 se vendait mieux que le 8.

En attendant les chiffres officiels, dont la société est toujours avare, Apple a réussi à donner l'image d'un lancement réussi. Le groupe a assuré la semaine dernière que les précommandes étaient ""au-delà des attentes"". D'ailleurs, si l'on veut commander l'iPhone X en ligne aujourd'hui, il ne faut pas être pressé: le délai est de 3 à 4 semaines.

Il le reconnaît lui-même: ""Je ne sais pas si je serais là où je suis sans les réseaux sociaux"".","INTERNATIONAL - C'était tout un symbole: en désactivant pendant onze minutes le compte de Donald Trump vendredi 3 novembre, un employé de Twitter est parvenu, en quelques clics, à atteindre l'un des organes fondamentaux de l'exercice du pouvoir à la Maison Blanche. Avec cet ultime acte de bravoure pour son dernier jour chez Twitter, il a été salué en héros. Car si les minutes ont dû paraître bien longues au président américain, elles ont été un court mais salutaire répit pour d'autres.

En près de dix mois à Washington et une année (le 8 novembre) en tant que président élu, Donald Trump a fait la pluie et le beau temps de la politique nationale et internationale en 140 caractères. Mesures, invectives et commentaires de toutes sortes se côtoient pêle-mêle sur son fil Twitter, dont la teneur n'a aucunement changé depuis qu'il n'est plus animateur d'émissions de télé-réalité. Il a d'ailleurs préféré conserver son compte personnel (@realDonaldTrump) en accédant à la Maison Blanche, le compte officiel du @POTUS n'étant qu'une suite de retweets de son propre profil.

Le réseau social a pris une telle place dans sa politique que le président américain y a développé des petites manies, qui en disent long sur sa vision du pouvoir... et donnent parfois le vertige.

1. La routine des tweets matinaux

Les journalistes couvrant la Maison Blanche le savent bien, aller sur Twitter est l'un des rituels matinaux du président. Certaines expressions se sont même installées: Donald Trump fait sa ""tirade matinale sur Twitter"", sa ""tempête"", sa ""colère du matin"".

En un an, Donald Trump a envoyé 43% de ses tweets entre 2 et 9 heures du matin (retweets compris), comme nous permet de le calculer le site Trump Twitter Archive. En août, le journaliste du New York Times Peter Baker disait ceci de la matinée type de Donald Trump, qu'il soit au travail ou en vacances: ""Il se lève, il allume la télévision, il voit quelque chose qui le rend fou, et il cherche son téléphone -avec son compte Twitter déjà activé dessus- pour se défouler"".

Dès les premiers mois du mandat de Donald Trump, nombre d'observateurs ont en fait remarqué que le président américain réagissait en même temps qu'étaient évoqués les sujets de l'émission matinale ""Fox and Friends"" sur Fox News, ce qui explique qu'il puisse parfois commenter des sujets sur lesquels on ne l'attendait pas.

""À gauche, Fox & Friends, 6h29. À droite, 6h56 (Donald Trump regarde parfois en différé, ce qui explique le laps de temps entre l'émission et son tweet)""

""Plus que tout dans l'Amérique de Trump, ces tweets tendent à donner le ton de la journée, et son humeur du jour"", interprètent deux journalistes de ABC en Australie. En s'imposant dès le saut du lit à ses quelque 42 millions d'abonnés sur Twitter, Donald Trump donne le rythme de l'actualité à ses soutiens comme à ses détracteurs, et dicte les sujets qui feront parler. ""C'est une alarme de réveil comme il n'y en a pas d'autre"", disent-elles.

I've got to stop going on twitter in the morning...Trump just makes my blood boil! — Pink Fluffy Timbers (@Timberkart) 3 novembre 2017

""Je dois arrêter d'aller sur Twitter le matin... Trump fait bouillir mon sang!""

Il arrive aussi régulièrement au président américain de tweeter tard le soir, pour corriger une nouvelle fois ce qui a pu être dit sur lui ou s'imposer dans un débat. Certains observateurs l'expliquent par le fait que Donald Trump ne dort que quelques heures par nuit, ""trois ou quatre heures"", de son propre aveu. ""Mais il ne tweete pas tard dans la nuit parce qu'il est en colère, il tweete tard dans la nuit parce qu'il tweete tard dans la nuit. Parce qu'il avait quelque chose à dire à ce moment précis donc il le dit, au lieu de, par exemple, aller se coucher (ou retourner se coucher)"", analyse un journaliste du Washington Post.

2. Des fautes d'orthographe... et des mots inventés

""Un acte sans président"" (au lieu de ""sans précédent""), ""le conseil de la Maison Blanche"" (au lieu du ""conseiller de la Maison Blanche""), ""enrregistrer"" (au lieu de ""enregistrer"")... on ne compte pas les fois où le président américain a fait des fautes d'orthographe ou de grammaire dans ses tweets avant de les corriger, quand il prend la peine de le faire.

Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 28 janvier 2017

""Les articles me concernant dans le New York Times et le Washington Post sont tellement faux et haineux que le Times s'est même excusé auprès de..."" (le président américain écrit ""Thr"" au lieu de ""the"", ""gas"" au lieu de ""has"" et oublie la majuscule à ""Times"")

Saving this for postority. pic.twitter.com/wmnanHjPWF — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) 21 janvier 2017

Ici, le président est ""honéré de servir le grand peuple américain"", au lieu d'être ""honoré""... le jour de son investiture.

Certains de ses tweets suscitent aussi des interrogations pour les détails qui semblent y avoir été volontairement disséminés. Pourquoi rajouter cette lettre isolée à la fin de son tweet? Pourquoi utiliser une apostrophe pour qualifier le ""petit' sénateur Bob Corker""?

Son plus grand fait d'armes linguistique est évidemment l'invention du mot ""covfefe"", dans un tweet -incomplet- dans lequel il voulait semble-t-il parler de la ""couverture médiatique"" (""press coverage""). A-t-il fait une fausse manipulation? S'est-il endormi sur son clavier? Mystère. Mais le message, aimé 123.000 fois et retweeté plus de 100.000 fois, n'a été supprimé que six heures après sa publication.

""Cela montre bien qu'il n'aime pas être maîtrisé par ses conseillers"", analyse Amanda Terkel, cheffe du bureau du HuffPost américain à Washington, interrogée par Le HuffPost. ""Il utilise Twitter pour les contourner et écrit tout ce qu'il veut. Souvent, ce qu'il écrit n'est pas ce que ses conseillers aimeraient qu'il dise, explique-t-elle. Mais il pense savoir ce que sa base attend de lui, et il le lui donne. Cela vient du fait qu'il n'est pas un homme politique traditionnel -et c'est pour cela que tant de gens ont voté pour lui.""

Malheureusement pour Trump, tous ses tweets supprimés sont consignés par l'organisme ProPublica. Par souci de transparence, mais surtout pour conserver des écrits que la loi considère, au même titre qu'une note de service ou un pamphlet, comme des ""presidential records"", faisant partie des registres présidentiels de la Maison Blanche.

3. Des surnoms entrés dans les habitudes médiatiques

Avoir un surnom dans le vocabulaire du président américain est le meilleur moyen de savoir qu'il vous déteste. Donald Trump ne manque jamais d'affubler ses adversaires politiques de surnoms au mieux dégradants, au pire insultants. Hillary Clinton est ""Crooked Hillary"" (""Hillary la crapule""), le dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-Un est ""Little Rocket Man"" (""l'homme fusée""), Jeb Bush est ""Low Energy Jeb"" (""Jeb à basse tension""), la sénatrice démocrate Elizabeth Warren est ""Pocahontas"" (Trump l'accuse de mentir sur ses origines amérindiennes).

Plus d'une quinzaine de ses opposants ont ainsi droit à leur surnom régulier, sans compter les sobriquets ponctuels, comme lorsqu'il avait attaqué l'actrice Meryl Streep, qu'il juge ""surcotée"". Forcés de relayer la parole présidentielle, les médias ont malgré eux fait entrer ces surnoms dans l'actualité, quitte à appuyer les travers des adversaires visés par Trump.

Mais l'utilisation de ces surnoms obéit à une stratégie politique dont Donald Trump a bien saisi l'efficacité: frapper très fort, rapidement, là ou ça fait mal. Les réseaux sociaux et l'accélération de l'information poussent les politiques à rentabiliser leur temps et leur espace de parole, explique ainsi Dietram Scheufele, professeur de communication à l'Université du Wisconsin, interrogé par Business Insider.

""Pour son public, (l'utilisation des surnoms) a une très grande résonance, estime-t-il. Une grande partie de son succès est due à sa capacité à faire écho presque intuitivement chez son auditoire en seulement quelques mots"". En deux mots, Hillary Clinton est donc ramenée à l'affaire de ses emails. Et le point va donc à Donald Trump.

4. Des retweets qui en disent long sur sa manière de s'informer

S'il est hors de contrôle lorsqu'il tweete, Donald Trump l'est tout autant lorsqu'il partage des contenus sur son fil Twitter. En septembre, lors de l'une de ses sessions matinales sur le réseau social, il avait ainsi partagé un gif de l'un de ses sympathisants, le montrant jouant au golf et toucher Hillary Clinton dans le dos, la faisant trébucher. L'auteur de ce gif, @Fuctupmind sur Twitter, a été repéré par Buzzfeed, notamment à cause de ses tweets transphobes et antisémites.

""Le swing incroyable de Donald Trump #CrookedHillary""

L'an dernier, alors qu'il était toujours en campagne, il avait supprimé son tweet reprenant un montage photo d'Hillary Clinton qualifiée de ""candidate la plus corrompue de l'histoire"", cette expression ayant été inscrite dans une étoile de David. Le montage avait été réalisé par des suprémacistes blancs et néonazis.

Cette porosité entre des comptes véhiculant des idéologies douteuses et celui du président des États-Unis en dit long sur sa manière de s'informer et les idées dont il s'inspire tous les jours. ""Ce qu'il voit à travers son portail aux 140 caractères est un monde rempli de soutien à Trump"", résume le Washington Post. C'est pour souligner cela que le site d'information a créé le compte Twitter ""Trump's Feed"", qui retweete automatiquement tous les tweets des 45 comptes suivis par Donald Trump (9 sont de la Trump Organization, 7 sont de Fox News), et donne un aperçu de sa page d'accueil sur Twitter.

En twittant et retweetant des informations émanant de The Hill (un site d'information qui lui est favorable, et dont il connaît le propriétaire), de Breitbart News (plateforme de l'extrême droite américaine) ou de ses soutiens anonymes, Donald Trump prend le risque de partager des informations incorrectes (les fameuses ""fake news"", expression qui qualifiait au départ ses déclarations infondées et dont il a retourné le sens pour en faire l'apanage des médias).

""Le danger d'un président qui se nourrit de la télévision pour parler des événements nationaux et internationaux est qu'il se base très souvent sur des avis d'experts, les opinions des gens et non les faits"", analyse l'historien politique Mark Updegrove. Si le danger est grand, la puissance de frappe de Donald Trump sur Twitter et sa politique de la provocation systématique ont payé. Il le reconnaît lui-même: ""Je ne sais pas si je serais là où je suis sans les réseaux sociaux"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) — India jumped into 100th place on the World Bank's ranking of countries by Ease of Doing Business for the first time in its report for 2018, up about 30 places, driven by reforms in access to credit, power supplies and protection of minority investors.

The report, based on data from the capital New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai, ranked India among the top 10 ""improvers"" globally, having done better in eight out of 10 business indicators.

""Today's result is a very clear signal from India to the rest of the world that not only has the country been ready and open for business, as it has been for many decades, it is now competing as the preferred place to do business globally,"" Annette Dixon, World Bank's vice president for South Asia, told reporters in New Delhi.

""Starting a business is now faster,"" Dixon said, adding that India had strengthened access to credit system and made it easier to secure to procure construction permits.

However, the agency noted that India lags in areas such as ""starting a business"", ""enforcing contracts"" and ""dealing with construction permits.""

The report excluded the impact of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock withdrawal of high-value banknotes last year and the implementation of a nationwide multi-rate goods and services tax (GST), steps that affected businesses and dragged the economy to a three-year-low in the April-June quarter.

""In the case of GST, we know that this is a very complicated reform,"" Dixon said, adding that the agency would observe the GST for the next two or three years to see its full implementation.

This month Modi eased tax rules for small and medium-sized companies in a bid to address growing criticism of his stewardship of Asia's third-largest economy.

The World Bank report, covering the period from 2 June last year to 1 June this year, ranked India top among the South Asian nations.

""This year's remarkable results are the culmination of efforts that have taken place over the past three years, so you can extrapolate forward and see that steps that are taken this year may take 2-3 years to show up in the results,"" Dixon said.

Von Jenna B.

Ihr wisst sicher einiges über Depressionen.

Ihr wisst, dass Menschen mit Depressionen sich oft traurig und leer fühlen, keinen Appetit haben oder schlecht schlafen können. Dass sie müde sind und dass ihnen Dinge keine Freude mehr bereiten, die sie normalerweise lieben würden. Und dass sie vielleicht sogar an den Tod und ans Sterben denken.

Doch ein Symptom von Depressionen, von dem ihr wahrscheinlich noch nicht gehört habt und gleichzeitig eines, das mit am schwersten zu ertragen ist: Einsamkeit.

Wir Menschen sehnen uns nach Nähe. Sogar die meisten Introvertierten wollen mit kleinen Gruppen oder einzelnen Personen in Interaktion treten.

Doch wenn ich mich depressiv fühle, kann ich mich selbst nicht dazu bringen, Verabredungen auszumachen oder einzuhalten. Manchmal kann ich nicht mal duschen und mich anziehen, geschweige denn das Haus verlassen.

Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut

Doch das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Gesellschaft möchte. Im Gegenteil: Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut. Doch ich habe Angst, jemanden zu fragen.

Ich weiß, dass ich andere damit belaste. Und ich weiß auch, dass es keinen Spaß macht, mit mir Zeit zu verbringen, weil ich immer traurig bin und es mir schwer fällt, die Dinge zu genießen, die ich früher gerne mochte.

Ich fühle mich schuldig, dass ich diese Gesellschaft möchte, dass ich jemanden in meiner Nähe brauche.

Wenn ich mich sehr schlimm niedergeschlagen fühle, sehne ich mich nach jemanden, mit dem ich sprechen kann und der mich versteht, ohne mich zu verurteilen. Doch ich bekomme meinen Mund nicht auf, um nach der Hilfe zu fragen, die ich brauche.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt

Ich bin gefangen in meinem eigenen Kopf und ich kann mich innerlich schreien hören. Doch leider kann niemand meine Gedanken lesen.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt und desto weniger Kraft habe ich, mit anderen Menschen in Kontakt zu treten. Doch das ist genau der Zeitpunkt, an dem ich am meisten auf jemanden angewiesen bin, der sieht, was mit mir los ist.

Es ist traurig, dass die Symptome von Depressionen dafür sorgen, dass du so viele Freunde verlierst. Wegen des Stigmas, das der Krankheit anhaftet, oder weil sie nicht verstehen oder Angst haben oder nicht wissen, wie sie helfen sollen. Oder weil sie beschäftigt sind und nicht gestört werden wollen.

Denn manchmal ist der beste Weg, einem Freund oder geliebten Person mit Depressionen zu begegnen, einfach Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen und zu tun, wonach ihm ist.

Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen

Auch wenn das nur ein Netflix-Abend auf der Couch ist oder ein gemeinsamer Kaffee oder ein Abendessen. Allein dadurch, dass du dich um deinen Freund oder deine Freundin kümmerst, hilft ihm oder ihr, sich besser zu fühlen.

Sogar wenn der Andere deine Worte der Beschwichtigung und des Trostes nicht zu hören scheint, kann deine Anwesenheit sehr wertvoll für ihn sein. Es tut immer gut zu wissen, dass jemand sich um dich sorgt und aufrichtige, liebevolle Worte zu hören.

Mir hilft das immer sehr, wenn ich depressiv bin. Es erinnert mich daran, dass ich diese Liebe verdient habe und hilft mir, an meiner Selbstliebe zu arbeiten, die mich aus der Depression herausziehen kann.

Wenn ihr also einen Freund oder Liebsten habt, der unter Depressionen leidet, erinnert euch bitte immer daran: Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen. Depressionen sind eine Krankheit, die sehr einsam macht. Und Nähe zu anderen Menschen ist extrem wichtig bei der Genesung.

""Have a Kris Kringle, set a budget and then buy for one family member or a couple or what have you.
Often when you get to a certain age and Christmas comes around, you're thinking 'what else do I want?'
""Buy Christmas paper when it's on sale.
""You may also want to set up some kind of direct debit system that helps you save for Christmas next year.","Okay, so we don't mean to alarm anybody, but if you happen to get paid monthly, you have exactly two paydays left until Christmas rears it's expensive, tinselled head.

Or, to put it another way, there are eight Fridays between now and C-day. Eight.

So while it may be a little too late to start any proper Christmas financial planning, there are still some things you can do to ensure you don't end up spending your entire pay packet at Westfield on Christmas Eve (let's face it, probably on things you don't need and your relatives definitely don't want.)

Here are our top tips.

1. Make a list

No, we're not talking about times when you've been naughty or nice. We're talking about a list of all the things you need to buy. In other words -- no impulse purchases for you!

""Don't do last minute Christmas shopping. It will end up being all impulse buys. Figure out what you need to buy now -- plan it out and set a budget,"" CEO and founder of JBS Financial Strategists, Jenny Brown, told HuffPost Australia.

""No matter what it is, whether it's Christmas or saving for a holiday, it all comes back to setting a budget and setting a goal to make sure you are going to hit it.""

2. Shop online

One of the great things about shopping online is it's so easy to shop around for the best price -- a practice Brown greatly encourages.

""If you know you are going to buy a certain article of clothing or present or whatever it's going to be, search around online,"" she said.

""It's amazing how much you can save. And if they deliver, have it delivered to your work so you save yourself the hassle of going to the post office to pick things up.""

3. Consider a Kris Kringle

If you have a large family, it's well worth considering having a Kris Kringle, whereby participants draw a name out of the hat and just buy a present for that single person.

The great thing about a Kris Kringle (or Secret Santa gift exchange) is that not only does it keep costs down, but it means people are more likely to receive what they actually want rather than a whole bunch of smaller items that will end up in the bottom of a drawer.

Big family? Try a Kris Kringle to cut down costs.

""If you have a situation where there are 13 members in a family, it just becomes ridiculous,"" Brown said.

""Have a Kris Kringle, set a budget and then buy for one family member or a couple or what have you.

""Alternatively, just buy for the kids. Often when you get to a certain age and Christmas comes around, you're thinking 'what else do I want?' Eliminating the adults and just focusing on the kids can be a great way to bring down costs.""

4. Don't use your credit card

This is probably going to be the toughest thing to do this Christmas, but you'll thank yourself next year when your bill isn't out of control.

""Be careful of the credit cards. Don't have the attitude of 'I'll deal with it in January', because then you have to pay it off, and how are you going to do that?"" asks Brown.

""If you aren't good with that kind of discipline, use cash only. Get out the amount you're going to spend and shop according to your list. Really plan out what you are going to spend it on.

""Another trick is to freeze your credit card in water in a plastic container. If you want to use it, you'll have to defrost it, which reduces the chance of you impulse buying.""

Home-made presents are thoughtful and kind to the bank balance.

5. Get crafty

Who's to say you have to spend a fortune on gifts? Why not embrace your inner hipster and plant some succulents or make some jam?

""That's actually one of the things we've done,"" Brown said. ""I've been growing home made veggies and making things like homemade chutneys and jams.

""It's a lovely thoughtful gift as well as bringing costs right down, especially if you do things like recycle your jars.""

6. Prepare for next year

If you want to put yourself in the best possible stead for Christmas 2018, it pays to start planning now.

""It's never too early to start,"" Brown said. ""Buy Christmas paper when it's on sale. You can often get really good deals in January. That goes for cards too.

""You may also want to set up some kind of direct debit system that helps you save for Christmas next year.

""If you start planning ahead, it really does pay off in the long run.""",How To Avoid Spending Too Much This Christmas,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/02/how-to-avoid-spending-too-much-this-christmas_a_23264195/

The pop star and “Voice” coach sat down with CBS Sunday Morning and spoke candidly about how her popular on-screen persona sparked identity issues.

“America feels like my aunt [telling me], “You know, you’re growing up so much and we don’t want to see you grow up,” she said, continuing, “I think why people loved Hannah Montana was because Hannah Montana did feel real, and that’s because I was under there.”

Cyrus said the lines between her personas started blurring once she went out on tour as both Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus. When asked how she dealt with that, she replied, “I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now. I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”

She then credited her provocative “Wrecking Ball” music video as the catalyst for allowing her to distinguish her true self from her squeaky-clean Disney star alter ego.

“I didn’t realize that it was going to shift me into truly being my own person,” Cyrus said. “It changed my life. I felt like that divide, that boundary, was very clear.”

The video’s sexual nature —who can forget a naked Cyrus riding on a wrecking ball — combined with a controversial performance at the 2013 Video Music Awards catapulted the singer into a brand new territory, identity-wise. It also led to a fair share of criticism.

En la primera temporada hay quienes me señalaban como ""la esposa de Rob"", por eso es que en esta, quiero que me conozcan por quien soy.","Limitar a Patricia Maya como ""la esposa de Rob Schneider"" es un error (y uno muy grande).

Entonces, ¿cómo describirla en un futuro? Aquí algunos datos:

Maya inició su carrera en CDMX, de hecho, ella fue la productora y escritora de programas como Guerra de chistes, El Monchis y Cuentamelove, todos ellos de Telehit. Gracias al éxito de estos shows, en 2010 se mudó a Estados Unidos para escribir la serie de Azteca América, El pelado de la noche, y no solo eso, también fue la conductora. Ésta fue la primera vez frente a las cámaras y el público.

En 2011, Patricia se casó con Rob Scheider y en 2012, crearon la serie Rob, para CBS, en la cual también aparecía Eugenio Derbez. El programa fue cancelado, pero en 2014, Netflix compró la idea y después de esto, las cosas se pusieron interesantes.

Real Rob es una serie de, por ahora dos temporadas, que muestra la vida de una familia mexicoestadounidense que tiene que compaginar ambos estilos de vida. Aunque es ficción, en ocasiones parece que estás viendo un reality show.

Platicamos en exclusiva con Maya sobre la segunda temporada de Real Rob, la cual ya se encuentra disponible en Netflix; cómo es su vida junto a uno de los comediantes más icónicos de Estados Unidos y cómo fue que convenció a Rob de apoyar al equipo de futbol regiomontano, Tigres.

""Claro que muchas cosas de las que suceden en el show es mentira, otras no"", nos dijo Maya entre risas.

HuffPost México: ¿Por ejemplo, qué es verdad?

Maya: En la primera temporada, a Rob se le cae un Buda al baño. Llamamos al plomero y nos dijeron que tenían que cambiar todo el baño. Nos iban a cobrar como dos mil quinientos dólares, ¡una locura! Cerca de nosotros había una construcción y me acerqué. Encontré a varios mexicanos trabajando ahí, y les pedí que nos ayudaran. Fueron a la casa y en cuestión de minutos, resolvieron nuestro problema. Cuando llegó el momento de pagarles, nos dijeron que unos sándwiches eran más que suficiente.

La primera temporada consta de 8 capítulos de aproximadamente 30 minutos, en los que los problemas maritales, de cultura e idioma entran en juego. Para esta segunda entrega, los Schneider decidieron hablar sobre el rol de la mujer en la familia y lo que sucede cuando ésta se convierte en el sostén y empieza a tener más fama que el mismísmo actor de Hollywood.

""La serie es una exageración de nosotros. Tiene toques de realidad pero no mucho. Va más por el objetivo de entretener a la gente. Ni yo soy una intensa con Rob, ni Rob es un egocéntrico como se muestra en la serie"", dijo Maya.

En cada capítulo, el matrimonio logra combinar el humor mexicano con el estadounidense, dejándole al televidente una serie de chistes ""negros"" que, a veces, pueden incomodar. Pero es parte del plan.

""Los dos escribimos la serie, así que encontrar el punto medio entre la comedia estadounidense, que es muy físico, y el toque se humor sarcástico"", señala la actriz.

Además de mostrar un poco de su matrimonio y su día a día, la pareja quiere realmente romper los estereotipos que existen sobre la fama. ""Yo pienso que muchas familias se pueden identificar con nosotros. Esos detalles de pareja, como cuando tienes un hijo y no te ayuda el otro"".

Rob Schneider y Patricia Maya Schneider

HuffPost: Patricia, vemos que en Estados Unidos firmas como ""Patricia Maya Schneider"" y en México como ""Patricia Maya"", a ti ¿cómo te gustaría que te identificaran?

Maya: En esta segunda temporada, firmo como Patricia Maya Scheider, y lo hago porque me gustaría que la gente me empezara a conocer como Patricia Maya. Y no porque no quiera que sepan que Rob es mi esposo, al contrario, ¡estoy muy orgullosa de serlo! Pero, siento que hay personas que piensan que Rob me está haciendo un favor en ponerme en la serie. Me quitan valor. Y no se dan cuenta que escribo, produjo e invertí dinero en este programa. En la primera temporada hay quienes me señalaban como ""la esposa de Rob"", por eso es que en esta, quiero que me conozcan por quien soy.

Además de escribir y actuar en Real Rob, Maya está elaborando un guión para hacer una película enfocada 100% en mujeres, la cual desea empezar a filmar en 2018. Así como otro guión sobre una mujer poderosa, ""yo quiero enaltecer a las mujeres"", recalcó.

HuffPost: Con tantas series que hay en Netflix, ¿cómo le hacen para destacar y que la gente los vea?

Maya: La ventaja que tiene Netflix es que cuentan con un algoritmo tan preciso y bueno, que si la gente ve comedia, les va a aparecer Real Rob. Ahora, si te fijas, no hay muchas comedias porque es un género que no es para todos. Además, pienso que cada serie y producto tiene su mercado, ¡imagínate!

Bei einer Neuwahl würden sich die Wähler ähnlich entscheiden wie bei der Bundestagswahl

64 Prozent der Bundesbürger rechnen damit, dass die Jamaika-Gespräche erfolgreich sein werden. Lediglich unter den Anhängern der AfD ist eine Mehrheit von 49 Prozent der Auffassung, die Jamaika-Verhandlungen seien zum Scheitern verurteilt. Das ermittelte das Meinungsforschungsinstitut Forsa im Auftrag der Mediengruppe RTL.

Die Zuversicht der Wähler in eine mögliche Jamaika-Koalition ist immer noch groß. ""Der Anteil der Bürger, die mit einer Jamaika-Koalition rechnen, ist Anfang November im Vergleich zu Mitte Oktober um acht Prozentpunkte zurückgegangen"", entgegnet jedoch Forsa-Chef Prof. Manfred Güllner gegenüber der Mediengruppe RTL, wie der Nachrichtensender n-tv berichtet.

Das liege daran, dass es bei den Gesprächen in Berlin bislang nur mühsame Fortschritte gab. Anhänger der CSU seien spürbar skeptischer als die Anhänger der CDU, FDP und Grünen.

""Dennoch setzt nach wie vor eine deutliche Mehrheit auf das Jamaika-Bündnis, weil das allein – nach der Regierungs-Verweigerung der SPD – dem Wählerwillen entspricht"", sagte Güllner.

Großes Interesse an den Sondierungen

Laut n-tv haben in der aktuellen Forsa-Umfrage 50 Prozent der Bevölkerung ein großes Interesse an den Sondierungsgesprächen zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen.

Dabei gebe es keine nennenswerten Differenzen zwischen den Partei-Anhängern. Nur die Nichtwähler seien nicht wirklich interessiert: 24 Prozent von ihnen hielten die Koalitionsgespräche für wichtig.

Keine Unterschiede zwischen Umfrage und Wahlergebnis

Bei einem Scheitern der Koalitionsverhandlungen ständen voraussichtlich Neuwahlen an, die SPD will auch dann keine Koalition mit der Union eingehen. Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt würden Neuwahlen wenig an der Zusammensetzung des Bundestags ändern.

Lediglich die Grünen, die der Umfrage nach auf 10 Prozent kommen, würden mehr als einen Prozentpunkt hinzugewinnen.

""Die Wahlberechtigten sehen keinen Grund, ihre Entscheidung neu zu überdenken""

Güllner sagte dazu gegenüber n-tv: ""Eine Wahlentscheidung ist deshalb nicht einfach, weil ja kaum jemand – auch nicht die meisten Mitglieder einer Partei – hundertprozentig mit allen Vorstellungen einer Partei übereinstimmt. Bei der Stimmabgabe aber muss man sich für eine Partei entscheiden – also eine 'Hundertprozent-Entscheidung' treffen.”

Nachdem die Wahlberechtigten ihre Entscheidung im September gefällt hätten, sähen sie keinen Grund, ihre Entscheidung neu zu überdenken - zumal sich das Erscheinungsbild der einzelnen Parteien seit dem 24. September nicht geändert habe.

“Käme es deshalb heute zu Neuwahlen des Bundestags, würde sich das Ergebnis nur in Nuancen vom Wahlergebnis im September unterscheiden.""

Prévue le 4 avril 2018 au cinéma, la sortie de ""Gaston Lagaffe"", l'adaptation du célèbre personnage de bande dessinée, sera largement scrutée par les spécialistes de la BD de Franquin.

Et pour faire patienter, la production a pris l'initiative de dévoiler les premières images du film de l'humoriste, Pierre-François Martin Laval (surnommé ""PEF"").

Un casting de choix

Fidèle à l'histoire racontée à la BD créée en 1957 par le dessinateur belge, André Franquin, cette adaptation devrait néanmoins comporter quelques surprises. À cet effet, Gaston Lagaffe ne devrait plus travailler pour le Journal de Spirou, ""mais dans une start-up, ""Au bon petit coin"", qui 'rend utile l'inutile', rachète des stocks de malfaçons pour les recycler. Une boîte sur laquelle lorgne le businessman Jean De Mesmaeker (joué par Jérôme Commandeur), qui possède déjà plusieurs sites de vente en ligne"", comme le rapportait en avril dernier la Provence.

Concernant le casting, celui-ci nous livre les photos de quelques têtes d'affiche. À commencer par Théo Fernandez (passé par ""Les Tuche"") qui incarne le célèbre gaffeur au pull vert.

Pour rappel, le réalisateur ""PEF"" incarnera ainsi le chef de Gaston, Prunelle, l'acteur Arnaud Ducret (apparu dans ""Adopte un veuf"", ""Les Profs 2"") jouera l'officier de police ""Joseph Longtarin"".

L'humoriste et comédienne Alison Wheeler, passée dans ""Cloclo"" et ""Going to Brazil"", interprétera la secrétaire au journal de Spirou, ""Mademoiselle Jeanne"". Enfin, le copain de dépressif de Gaston, Bertrand Labévue, sera joué par Esteban.

Voici les premières images de l'adaptation qui sortira donc en avril 2018. En prime, la célèbre voiture du héros, la fameuse Fiat 531 que tous les fans connaissent bien.

Les puissants chefs de la garde nationale saoudienne – une force d'élite intérieure –, et de la marine ont été limogés. Miteb Bin Abdullah, fils de l'ancien roi, a notamment été écarté de cette garde nationale.

Cette opération ""mains propres"" est en réalité une phase supplémentaire de l'opération ""mains libres""

Depuis son avènement très critiqué voire moqué, pour sa jeunesse, son inexpérience et sa fougue le prince Mohammed Bin Salman plus communément appelé MBS a mené une incroyable campagne à l'intérieur de son pays, comme au plan international.

Après avoir séduit le nouveau Président des USA et l'avoir totalement détourné de la politique d'apaisement à l'égard de l'Iran menée par son prédécesseur ,ce qui n'était pas vraiment une mission insurmontable mais réussie le prince MBS est parti à la conquête des grands de ce monde par une diplomatie hyper active.

Le prince MBS s'est aussi entouré d'une équipe de jeunes ministres et de conseillers en communication venus des meilleurs agences du monde.

Il sait l'image dégradée de son pays, il sait les critiques qui sont faites autour de sa gouvernance, du financement du terrorisme ou de l'archaïsme d'une société en prise au choc de la modernité et des réseaux sociaux.

MBS a compris que le monde avait changé et il en tire les conséquences, et il se donne les moyens de sa politique.

Grâce à la Fondation MISK il propage sa vision de l'Arabie 2030 ,forum d'investissements massifs à Ryad la semaine dernière, MISK GLOBAL FORUM la semaine prochaine qui rassemblera l'élite du monde des affaires tournée vers la jeunesse et l'innovation de Bill Gates à John Chambers président de CISCO Systems.

C'est aussi la fondation MISK qui supporte et soutient les équipes de sports féminins comme l'équipe de basket de Jeddah United women's basketball team and Sports menée de main de maître par Lina Al Maeena, venue à Paris en avril dernier pour un match amical, une vingtaine de jeunes joueuses ont joué à Paris sans chaperon, sans leur père ou leur frère avec l'accord de leurs parents... une révolution à l'échelle du pays et en plus les Saoudiennes ont battu l'équipe française.

C'est encore MISK qui soutient artistes et participations aux forum internationaux comme le Women forum de Deauville ou traditionnellement les femmes saoudiennes viennent briller notamment dans le secteur high-tech.

C'est sous l'impulsion de MBS que les femmes ont été autorisées à conduire il y a quelque semaines mettant un terme à des années de lutte interne et d'incompréhension internationale face à cet archaïsme anachronique et insupportable.

Concomitamment, un chef religieux déclarait que les femmes disposaient d'un quart de cerveau...

Le combat pour l'égalité n'est pas simple mais il progresse au rythme que lui donne MBS compte tenu de l'environnement de la population saoudienne et des autorités religieuses traditionalistes qui jouent un rôle majeur.

L'opération anti corruption menée samedi contre des ministres et des responsables de la sécurité du pays est une opération classique pour faire taire les oppositions et les jalousies nombreuses feutrées ou moins feutrées exprimées dans le Royaume.

Cette opération vise aussi à passer un message au monde.

L'Arabie Saoudite a décidé de changer son image et ses pratiques, elle y met les moyens et affirme sa volonté.

La lutte contre le financement du terrorisme, sans doute tardive est réelle.

Ainsi les responsables du Royaume ont-ils décidé de coopérer avec les services de TRACFIN pour mettre en place des bonnes pratiques et échanger des informations.

C'est une avancée remarquable.

Voilà quelques éléments de contexte au plan intérieur. Restent les questions des droits de l'Homme, de la peine de mort de la Sharia autant de pratiques auxquelles nous ne pouvons adhérer.

J'ai rencontré longuement MBS lors de son passage à Paris en 2016. Je lui ai posé la question de la libération de Rafic Badawi, il m'a expliqué le dossier et sa position, en substance, la pression internationale ne fera pas plier le système!

Donc des éclaircies dans un ciel lourd et pesant au plan intérieur mais qu'en est-il au plan extérieur?

Le Yemen est devenu un champ de ruine et de mort ,les tribus se vendent au plus offrant créant une illisibilité totale des forces en présence, dans un jeu de GO improbable où il est difficile d'avoir un jugement manichéen simpliste des bons et des méchants, des forces légitimes ou des rebelles... j'admire ceux qui sur ce dossier expriment des certitudes...

L'Iran ennemi historique et pathologique est une constante obsession dans la politique étrangère de l'Arabie Saoudite.

Ses positions nécessiteraient en dehors de siècles sur un divan de psychanalystes, des pages et des pages d'explications, totalement synallagmatiques d'ailleurs avec les visions iraniennes en parfait miroir!

On pourrait dérouler à l'infini ce tableau des soubresauts d'un pays en pleine évolution ,mais je ne voudrais pas passer sous silence la démission hier, de Saad Harriri premier ministre Libanais, démission annoncée depuis... Ryad sa ville natale.

Cette décision ne peut pas être un hasard, ni de temps, ni de lieu et doit être mise en perspective avec la croisade anti chiite menée par l'Arabie Saoudite.

L'Iran, une menace constante dans l'esprit des Saoudiens, l'Iran mais aussi ses proxis, Hezbollah et milices Houthis, les chiites de Bahrein et les minorités chiites d'Arabie Saoudite localisées essentiellement dans les zones pétrolières du Royaume.

En démissionnant ainsi, au risque connu de faire sombrer le Liban dans la crise institutionnelle et la reprise en main du pays par le Hezbollah, Saad Harriri a choisi de protéger sa vie, qui l'en blâmerait.

Le Liban n'aura alors d'autre choix que de se tourner vers ses alliés et vers le Royaume d'Arabie Saoudite qui on se le rappelle avait contribué financièrement et massivement, pour 3 milliards d'euros à l'équipement français pour ses armées, il y a moins de 2 ans.

Le Général de Gaulle n'a jamais été autant d'actualité: ""vers l'Orient compliqué je m'envolais avec des idées simples, avec le sentiment qu'il s'y passait des choses essentielles et qu'il fallait en être"".

Oui l'Orient est compliqué.

Oui il s'y passe des choses essentielles.

Oui il faut en être.

La France a un rôle essentiel à jouer de médiateur dans une zone si prompte à s'enflammer.

Bei Sondierungsgesprächen geht es eigentlich ums Antasten, ums Kennenlernen, Vertrauen aufbauen. Die Jamaika-Sondierungen erscheinen dagegen bisweilen wie ein offener Schlagabtausch.

Auch Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck ist genervt davon, wie wenig konstruktiv einige Politiker der verhandelnden Parteien die Gespräche angehen. Im Gespräch mit dem ARD forderte Habeck deshalb, Handys bei den Verhandlungen in Zukunft vor der Tür zu lassen.

""Man hat teilweise eins zu eins online lesen können, wie man gerade redet"", sagte Habeck in der Sendung ""Bericht aus Berlin"" am Sonntagabend. Vertrauen sei da ""ein seltenes Gut"". Sein Vorschlag: ""Wir legen alle unsere Handys draußen vor die Tür und holen die nach zwei, drei Stunden wieder.""

Auch im ""Handelsblatt"" appellierte Habeck an die Sondierer, sich mit öffentlichen Aussagen über ein mögliches Scheitern der Gespräche zurückzuhalten. ""Wir sollten uns nun darauf konzentrieren, gemeinsame Ergebnisse zu erzielen und das Neuwahl-Gerede endlich einstellen“, sagte der Kieler Umweltminister.

""80 zu 20 Chance, dass es klappt""

Dennoch glaubt Habeck, dass Jamaika letztendlich zustandekommt. ""Vernunftbegabte Menschen müssen versuchen, es hinzukriegen"", sagte der Grünen-Politiker – und bezifferte die Chance einer Koalition auf 80 Prozent.

Auch in in der Union wächst die Sorge, dass die Verhandlungen platzen könnten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel warnte davor, immer wieder eine vorgezogene Neuwahl für den Fall des Scheiterns ins Spiel zu bringen. Auch die CDU müsse ein Jamaika-Bündnis nicht um jeden Preis eingehen, sagte die Kanzlerin am Montag nach Angaben von Teilnehmern in einer Sitzung des CDU-Vorstands in Berlin.

Nach einer am Montag veröffentlichten Forsa-Umfrage im Auftrag der Mediengruppe RTL würde sich das Ergebnis bei einer Neuwahl kaum vom Resultat der Bundestagswahl vom 24. September unterscheiden.

6 razones por las que las mujeres duermen mal

Aunque las hormonas podrían ser la principal causa de los problemas de sueño, existen otros factores que van de lo físico a lo emocional:

Lo principal es identificar las causas de los problemas para dormir.

De acuerdo con Orma, consultar a un especialista es clave para determinar si la causa es psicológica o biológica u hormonal. Un médico podría solicitar una serie de estudios para descartar causas físicas.

With Craig voting to axe Aston and fellow judges Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli opting to keep him in, it was new Head Judge Shirley Ballas who cast the deciding vote, giving the former JLS singer his marching orders. The result was met with a backlash on social media, with many naming it the most shocking exit in ‘Strictly’ history, and one of the show’s former experts Alesha was particularly unhappy with the way things transpired.

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Vladimir Putin's inner circle, according to a vast leak of financial documents that also revealed Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's investments in tax havens.

It was also revealed that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's top fundraiser and senior advisor Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, moved some USD 60 million to offshore tax havens with ex-senator Leo Kolber.

The findings have emerged as part of the Paradise Papers released by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which was behind the Panama Papers made public last year.

There is no suggestion that Ross, Bronfman or the Queen's private estate acted illegally. But Ross's ties to Russian entities raise questions over potential conflicts of interest, and whether they undermine Washington's sanctions on Moscow.

The revelations about Bronfman could spell trouble for Trudeau, who was elected two years ago riding on the coattails of promises to reduce economic inequality and tax avoidance.

In the case of Queen Elizabeth's private estate, critics may question whether it is appropriate for the British head of state to invest in offshore tax havens.

Ross, a billionaire investor, holds a 31 per cent stake in Navigator Holdings through a complex web of offshore investments detailed in the documents examined by nearly 100 news organisations as part of an international collaboration. The 79-year-old reduced his stake when he took public office, according to public filings.

Navigator Holdings runs a lucrative partnership with Russian energy giant Sibur, which is partially owned by Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov and Gennady Timchenko, the Russian president's friend and business partner who is subject to US sanctions.

The US imposed sanctions on Russian entities and individuals following its annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine.

Ross's private equity firm has been the biggest shareholder in Navigator. His personal share of the firm's stake was reduced when he took office in February, but the commerce chief's investment is still valued at between USD 2 million to USD 10 million, according to his security filings and government ethics disclosure.

The New York Times reported that Ross's stake in Navigator has been held by companies in the Cayman Islands. His wealth, estimated to exceed USD 2 billion, is said to be tied to similar arrangements in various tax havens like the Cayman Islands. ""Secretary Ross was not involved with Navigator's decision to engage in business with Sibur, a publicly traded company, which was not under sanction at the time and is not currently,"" said James Rockas, a Commerce Department spokesman.

""Moreover, Secretary Ross has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship.""

The documents also show around 10 million pounds (USD 13 million) of the Queen's private money was placed in funds held in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, first reported in Britain by the BBC and the Guardian newspaper.

They reported the funds reinvested the money in an array of businesses, including controversial rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and a chain of alcohol stores that later went bankrupt.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the monarch with an income and handles her investments, said, ""All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.""

""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds,"" she added.

The spokeswoman added that one of the fund investments represents only 0.3 per cent of the total value of the Duchy.

The Paradise Papers contain 13.4 million documents mainly from Appleby, an offshore law firm with offices in Bermuda and beyond. The files were first obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, and shared with the ICIJ and partner media outlets.

Solo il giorno dopo, il 3 novembre 2017, Murray ha capito che il suo gesto aveva suscitato clamore.

Quanto alla reazione di sua moglie, il figlio della coppia ha detto che è rimasta ""alquanto sorpresa"".","Voleva far sorridere sua moglie con una dichiarazione d'amore originale, ma la sua sorpresa è stata rovinata da un tweet della polizia locale. Murray Graham, un contadino dell'Oxfordshire, in Inghilterra, per stupire la compagna della sua vita aveva pensato di 'incidere' il suo nome, a caratteri cubitali, su un prato. Ha preso il diserbante e, con pazienza, ha fatto in modo che al posto dell'erba comparisse la scritta ""Sue"", con una ""x"" accanto. La singolare incisione, però, come racconta The Telegraph è stata notata dalla polizia locale che sorvolava l'area con un elicottero.

A tutto hanno pensato gli agenti, tranne ad una dichiarazione d'amore. Poiché non riuscivano a dare una risposta al mistero della scritta sull'erba hanno pensato di postare la foto su Twitter, chiedendo agli utenti di aiutarli a trovare una soluzione.

""Qualcuno conosce Sue?"", hanno domandato al popolo del web. Insieme alla foto, hanno lanciato l'hashtag #WhoIsSue - ""Chi è Sue?"". Le risposte degli utenti sono state le più disparate: c'era chi faceva riferimento ad un sottomarino chiamato Suex e si chiedeva se non si dovesse seguire questa pista. Alcuni poi erano convinti che si trattasse di un messaggio degli alieni.

E anche Sue, la protagonista del 'mistero', non aveva ancora avuto modo di vedere la scritta. Entrambi il giorno in cui l'immagine è stata diffusa erano a lavoro e non avevano i loro telefoni cellulari con loro; come ha spiegato il figlio, era quindi impossibile raggiungerli. Solo il giorno dopo, il 3 novembre 2017, Murray ha capito che il suo gesto aveva suscitato clamore.

Intervistato da The Telegraph ha raccontato come è nata questa idea: ""Mi era rimasto del diserbante ed ho pensato di utilizzarlo per far sorridere la mia donna. Volevo mostrarle che non sono così burbero come appaio all'esterno e che la amo veramente"". Così, Murray ha iniziato a cospargere l'area di disserbante, consapevole che i risultati non sarebbero apparsi subito: era necessario, infatti, che l'erba attorno al perimetro delle lettere crescesse perché queste potessero essere ben visibili.

Peccato, però, che prima che la sua Sue potesse accorgersi della sorpresa e ringraziarlo, l'immagine è diventata molto più popolare di quello che lui potesse pensare: ""Sono un po' sorpreso - ha confessato e, facendo probabilmente riferimento a chi insinuava che quella scritta l'avessero fatta gli alieni - non immaginavo che questo gesto avrebbe avuto risonanza nazionale, internazionale o addirittura intergalattico!"".

Quanto alla reazione di sua moglie, il figlio della coppia ha detto che è rimasta ""alquanto sorpresa"".

Drum prüfe...

Drum prüfe, wer sich ewig bindet... Das gilt für dieses Paar im Besonderen, denn die beiden sind seit November 2007 ein Paar. Schon lange zehn Jahre hält diese Liebe also. Im Dezember 2011 verlobten sich Annemarie Warnkross, wie sie damals noch hieß, und der Sohn des südafrikanischen Schlagerstars Howard Carpendale (71). Ihre persönliche Traumhochzeit feierten sie dann im September 2013 auf Ibiza.

Warnkross und Carpendale Junior waren aber auch zuvor schon jeweils mit prominenten Partnern zusammen. Während die gebürtige Hannoveranerin von 2002 bis 2004 mit Comedian Oliver Pocher (39) liiert war, schaffte es der in NRW geborene Künstler immerhin auf eine dreijährige Beziehung mit Kollegin Yvonne Catterfeld (37).

Auch beruflich zusammengewachsen

Auch beruflich ist das Traumpaar inzwischen zusammengewachsen. Seit 2016 moderieren Annemarie und Wayne Carpendale gemeinsam ""Ran an den Mann"" (Sat.1). Zuvor spielte er vor allem in Serien, Reihen und Soaps wie ""Unter uns"" (2000-2001), ""Unser Charly"" (2005-2007), "" Sturm der Liebe"" (2006-2008), ""Der Landarzt"" (2009-2013), ""Mord in bester Gesellschaft"" (2013-2015) oder ""Heldt"" (2015-2016).

Die öffentliche Karriere von Annemarie Warnkross begann als Tänzerin von Bellini (""Brazil""). Von 2000 bis 2005 war sie Mitglied der Pop-Gruppe. Danach konzentrierte sie sich auf Moderation, Modeln und das Studium. Seit 2005 führt sie durch die Magazine ""taff"" und ""red!"" - kurz vor der Sendung zeigt sie ihren Fans regelmäßig, welches sexy Outfit sie diesmal wieder tragen wird.

It was the most awful moment. Afterwards, you'd never have dreamed that jockey Kathy O'Hara and chestnut mare Single Gaze would be lining up as serious chances in the Melbourne Cup. But here they are.

The fall happened in April, 2016. Coming round the home turn of the Australian Oaks at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse, top jockey Kathy O'Hara peeled to the outside of the field aboard Single Gaze to make her run.

That's when it happened. In one of those horrible moments which you can file under ""that's racing"" rather than negligence, jockey Damien Oliver pushed his mount Jameka wide to make its run. It cannoned into another horse, Happy Hannah, which in turn struck Single Gaze.

Down they went.

There were huge initial fears for both horse and rider. O'Hara suffered concussion, and later underwent surgery that night for a collapsed lung. The horse, thankfully, was OK.

Even in her semi-conscious state, as she lay on the Randwick turf, all O'Hara could say to trainer Nick Olive was ""Nick, Nick, how's the horse?""

It took until February this year for Single Gaze to race again. Canberra-based trainer Nick Olive extended the olive branch to O'Hara and reunited the duo. Two wins and a string of consistent results followed, highlighted by a close-up second in traditional Melbourne Cup lead-up, the Caulfield Cup, in October.

""She went sensational. She gave everything and I'm so proud of her. She's so tough,"" O'Hara said after that race.

Jockeys often switch between horses on a race-to-race basis. But when they stick, they often form a close bond. These two have now raced 23 times together, and as you'd imagine, they're great mates.

So much ❤️❤️ A post shared by Kathy Ohara (@kathy_ohara) on Oct 21, 2017 at 3:07am PDT

Really, really great mates.

Good luck kiss 😘 A post shared by Kathy Ohara (@kathy_ohara) on Oct 12, 2017 at 10:24pm PDT

Onwards, then, to the Melbourne Cup, where Single Gaze will line up as a 40-1 outsider. It's not that there's anything wrong with its form. It's just that there are several hard-fit gallopers who've been running on the big stage for a while now.

Single Gaze may not quite have their class, but she's definitely got the guts.

O'Hara, meanwhile, will try to become the second female jockey after Michelle Payne to win Australia's greatest race. The Sydney-based 31-year-old has been riding professionally for 15 years. In that time she's notched up almost 800 winners, including 215 in Sydney.

O'Hara is in hot form too, having ridden three of the eight winners at the most recent Sydney race meeting just last weekend.

She's never won a race in Melbourne but hey, why not start with the one everyone will remember?","The Amazing Fall, Crash And Recovery Of Melbourne Cup Duo Kathy O'Hara And Single Gaze",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/05/the-amazing-fall-crash-and-recovery-of-melbourne-cup-duo-kathy-ohara-and-single-gaze_a_23267496/

Sin embargo, los empleados de menor jerarquía y aquellos que tienen ""contratos"" laborales precarios en otros sectores son menos propensos a señalar los abusos debido al temor de perder sus trabajos, dicen expertos.

La dinámica del poder en los ataques sexuales y el patrón para los depredadores para escoger a sus víctimas, quienes no siempre conocen sus derechos, derivan en que trabajadores del sector hospitalario y el turismo, así como a trabajadores con contratos temporales, enfrenten retos adicionales cuando se trata del acoso sexual.

""Uno no siempre conoce a un empleado de limpieza, o que aún no está en la ""nómina"", que piense: 'Jódanse todos, al fin que no necesito este trabajo'. De hecho, viven escenarios completamente opuestos, en los que más bien suelen pensar: 'Haré lo que sea por este trabajo, por favor déjeme quedarme'"", dijo a HuffPost UK, Michael Newman, especialista de leyes de discriminación y empleo de la firma legal Leigh Day.

De acuerdo con un reporte del Trade Union Congress (TUC) del año pasado sobre el acoso sexual, 67% de las mujeres en la industria de la hospitalidad y el entretenimiento informaron ser víctimas de acoso sexual, contra un promedio general de 52%.

Uno de los hallazgos del reporte es que ""los perpetradores de acoso sexual son a menudo terceras partes. Las mujeres que trabajan en industrias como la de ventas minoristas, hospitalidad, cuidados de la salud, hospitales, transportes y muchas otras más; así que lidian con clientes, pacientes y consumidores cotidianamente y tienen poca protección por parte de sus patrones cuando experimentan acoso. Implementar medidas para que los jefes tomen acciones cuando un empleado haya sido víctima de acoso por una tercera persona podría ser un paso importante para atacar este delito en los centros de trabajo"".

Ya sea al rodar películas o atender un bar, los hombres poderosos ven a las mujeres, y en algunos casos a hombres, como un objetivo que muy probablemente no hará nada al respecto si ellos deciden traspasarse de alguna forma.

Los expertos sugieren que es más frecuente observar una cultura del silencio en aquellos que son vulnerables financieramente, o que corren más en riesgo de perder sus empleos, generalmente sienten que no pueden reportar que han sido víctimas de acoso sexual.

El acoso sexual está muy relacionado con la dinámica del poder.

Scarlet Harris, directora de estrategias y desarrollo del TUC; dijo al HuffPost UK que ""Es un hecho que las mujeres más jóvenes están más expuestas al acoso sexual y creo que es justo decir que mientras más inferior sea tu puesto en una organización, más expuesta estás a experimentar acoso sexual debido a esa dinámica del poder"".

Desde octubre, hemos visto una avalancha de acusaciones de acoso sexual que se han hecho en contra del productor cinematográfico, Harvey Weinstein, a las vertidas la semana pasada en Westminster en torno a que miembros del Parlamento han sido involucrados en reclamos de acoso sexual.

Danielle Parsons, una abogada laboral en la firma Slater & Gordon, dice que, a pesar de que no hay una industria inmune al acoso sexual, los miembros más jóvenes y en puestos más bajos de un equipo están más expuestos a dicho acoso debido a la dinámica del poder.

¿En dónde ocurre el acoso laboral?

De acuerdo con Parsons, éste puede puede ocurrir en diversas industrias, pero generalmente sucede más donde existe la dinámica de tener a alguien en una posición de poder y a otra de menor rango reportándole.

Harris añadió que, a pesar de que el acoso sexual se ve ""absolutamente en todos lados"", aquellas personas con empleos temporales y los que tienen contratos por proyecto enfrentan más dificultades al reportar casos de acoso.

Esto se debe a que, por la naturaleza de los empleos temporales, los trabajadores se mueven en muchas organizaciones, por lo que a menudo se encuentran en lugares de trabajo en donde no conocen a nadie, no conocen las reglas corporativas y no saben a quién reportar los casos de acoso.

""Los perpetradores de acoso sexual suelen ser muy buenos en enfocarse en la persona que aparentemente sea menos capaz de lidiar con ellos; son expertos en detectar a alguien muy vulnerable y los cazarán debido porque los consideran un blanco fácil"", dijo Harris.

Además, los empleados en la industria de la hospitalidad están más expuestos al riesgo del acoso por terceras personas.

Los puestos en este rubro pueden incluir a empleados de restaurantes y bares, así como recepcionistas. También es frecuente en empleos en que los trabajadores tratan con clientes que podrían estar bajo los efectos del alcohol, pues a menudo los clientes se sienten con derecho de abordarlos.

El acoso sexual también puede ser un factor de ""humillación para las víctimas"", dice Parsons, y se puede manifestar de diversas formas, como el bullying, la intimidación o el comportamiento ofensivo.

A Parsons no sólo lo buscan mujeres para ayuda en acoso sexual. La abogada dice que en una ocasión un asistente masculino la buscó debido a los ""comentarios molestos e invasivos"" que su jefe profirió en torno a su sexualidad.

Newman aseguró que, aunque ha visto un incremento en la cifra de clientes que han decidido denunciar en público, el problema ""no parece mejorar"".

""No he visto una baja en el problema. Es tristemente continuo, lo cual, creo, es un problema"", dijo a HuffPost Uk. ""Es un flujo continuo y lo seguimos viendo. Cada vez que llega una nueva queja decimos: 'Ah, ahora es un caso en una industria en la que no se había visto... pero, ¿por qué me sorprende?'""

Concuerda con Parsons y Harris en el sentido de que mientras más joven o inexperto sea alguien, estará más expuesta al acoso sexual. ""En esos casos, las oportunidades para la explotación son mayores"".

Sin embargo, el acoso sexual también puede darse ""de abajo hacia arriba"".

Newman admite que quienes buscan su ayuda a menudo tuvieron que llegar al punto en los que contaban con los recursos para quejarse, una opción que quizá no sea válida para quienes están en posiciones más vulnerables, financiera y profesionalmente.

""Por lo general, cuando te acosan, si quieres permanecer en tu trabajo, lo más probable es que no te quejes"", dice Newman. ""Así que nunca me llegan esos casos. No es el tipo de gente que me busca"".

Asegura que la gente a quien no le preocupan los riesgos a sus empleos o su carrera probablemente se sienten así porque ya tienen planeado salirse de ese rubro de trabajo, o es gente que ya llegó a cierto nivel de seguridad en el que tiene más recursos para denunciar.

After cars and phones, homes are the next big frontier for technological innovation.

Another video from 2004 showed Affleck pulling Montreal TV host Anne-Marie Losique onto his lap.

Speaking Sunday, Affleck said two things need to happen, that ""more women need to be pushed to power"" and that sexual harassment has to also be ""a men's issue"" where guys call out inappropriate behaviour.","Amid Hollywood Sex Allegations, Ben Affleck Wants To Be 'Part Of The Solution'",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/06/amid-hollywood-sex-allegations-ben-affleck-wants-to-be-part-of-the-solution_a_23268149/

The group, which refers to itself simply as Islamic State, is a rival to the larger al Shabaab force, which is linked to Islamic State's rival al Qaeda and once controlled much of Somalia.

The United States has occasionally carried out strikes against al Shabaab militants in Somalia, which retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks.

The al Shabaab group aims to drive out the peacekeepers, topple Somalia's Western-backed government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state.

More than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in the Somali capital Mogadishu last month, the deadliest attack in the country's history.

However, she can now thank her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, for changing this (outdated) royal rule before her birth.

Under the Act of Settlement of 1701, all male siblings could skip ahead of their sisters in the line of succession, no matter their birth order, PopSugar reports. This is known as male primogeniture, and unfortunately meant the Queen's second child and only daughter, Princess Anne, was bumped from third-in-line to the throne to fifth after the birth of her siblings Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.

Princess Charlotte in Berlin during the royal tour of Poland and Germany in July 2017.

In 2013, Her Majesty decided to change this sexist system with the Succession of the Crown Act, which essentially replaced male primogeniture with absolute primogeniture. The act then became official in March 2015, just two months before Princess Charlotte was born, securing her place as fourth-in-line to the throne.

The new succession laws now apply to all royals born after Oct. 28, 2011. That year, 16 British Commonwealth countries — including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Bahamas — voted to make the changes. At that time, Britain's then-Prime Minister David Cameron said, ""The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he is a man ... this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we have become.""

Earlier on HuffPost:

Thanks to the new succession laws, Prince Charles is first-in-line to the throne, followed by Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The third royal baby, regardless of gender, will then be fifth-in-line, followed by Prince Harry.

The royals have always had very particular rules regarding succession and titles. For example, another rule is that Prince George's future children will receive royal titles, but Princess Charlotte's won't.

Lucy Hume, associate director of expert etiquette company Debrett's, explained this to Town & Country saying, ""Royal titles are inherited through sons, so if Princess Charlotte has children they would not automatically inherit the titles HRH, Prince, or Princess,"" she said.

Mais il reste encore un tabou que le mouvement #MoiAussi n'a pas réussi à mettre en lumière : l'utilisation du système de justice par certaines personnes comme un levier pour nuire à quelqu'un. Les fausses plaintes, principalement pour agressions sexuelles.

Beaucoup d'hommes craignent d'être victime d'une «Alice Paquet» de ce monde, qui a détruit la carrière de Gerry Sklavounos en alléguant un faux viol qu'il aurait commis contre elle. Cette crainte n'est pas dénuée de fondement...

Il est temps de réaliser que notre système de justice est complètement inapproprié pour les inconduites de nature sexuelle.

Et si on envisageait de changer nos façons de faire?

Et si on se disait qu'on veut agir pour protéger les victimes tout en reconnaissant qu'on ne veut voir aucun innocent faussement accusé? Actuellement, soit tu accuses ton agresseur au criminel, que tu passes des années sur le dossier, qu'on attaque ta crédibilité et qu'on te victimise à nouveau pour qu'au mieux, il ait une tape sur les doigts.

Soit, tu coules l'info à un(e) journaliste et tu espères qu'il (elle) trouve d'autres présumées victimes qui acceptent de parler. Soit, tu dénonces ton présumé agresseur directement sur Facebook... Et ce n'est qu'une question de temps pour qu'il y ait une fausse accusation... Soit, tu fermes ta gueule.

Protéger et servir.

Pourquoi ne favoriserait-on pas une approche différente? Comme signaler à la police sans vouloir procéder au criminel. Et là, je réfère à une expérience personnelle qui, je crois, pourrait être élargie au dossier qui nous intéresse.

Il y a une vingtaine d'années, j'ai eu un copain violent qui avait entre autres menacé de poser une bombe sous ma voiture. J'étais terrorisée chaque fois que je mettais la clé dans le contact...

Il avait été condamné pour m'avoir proféré des menaces et le juge avait ordonné qu'il soit deux ans sans entrer en contact avec moi, même indirectement. Ordonnance qu'il a respectée à la lettre.

Une fois le délai écoulé, il s'amusait à marcher, aller-retour devant la station-service où je travaillais, en me lançant un regard insistant.

À aucun moment, il ne s'est adressé à moi, mais j'étais terrorisée... Surtout quand je travaillais seule le soir...

Je suis allée à la police de Trois-Rivières et je leur ai raconté mon histoire. Les policiers* ont été très gentils avec moi et me sont venus en aide. Pourtant, leur boulot était compliqué puisque l'interdiction de contact n'était plus en vigueur et qu'il n'était pas entré en contact directement avec moi.

Finalement, ils ont déposé une plainte pour harcèlement, sachant très bien qu'aucun procureur n'y donnerait suite. Puis un policier est allé rencontrer le type en lui faisant comprendre que cette fois-ci, il n'y aurait pas de conséquence, mais que si des faits similaires se reproduisaient, il s'exposait à des poursuites puisque le tout était documenté.

Bref, j'ai finalement eu la paix. Plusieurs années plus tard, il était à quelques tables de moi dans un restaurant. Quand on s'est vus, il a détourné le regard, fini son assiette et quitté le restaurant quelques minutes plus tard.

Le problème était réglé. F-i-fi, n-i-ni!

Pourquoi ne pas faire ce genre d'interventions pour des inconduites sexuelles?

Ça implique très peu de frais, puisqu'on ne passe pas par les tribunaux. C'est très efficace puisqu'une personne qui perçoit que son comportement peut avoir de lourdes conséquences risque fort de le modifier.

On ferait exploser la probabilité qu'une victime signale le comportement, puisqu'elle n'aura pas à subir un contre-interrogatoire. Elle n'aura même pas à raconter publiquement ce qu'elle a subi. Elle n'aura pas non plus la crainte qu'un juge déclare son agresseur non coupable. Et disons-le, aucune victime ne veut être seule à dénoncer.

Ça redonne un pouvoir à court terme à la personne qui subit les inconduites.

Ça diminue le risque d'une fausse accusation, puisque le tout est traité sans que ça ne soit rendu public.

Et finalement, les policiers peuvent documenter les inconduites sexuelles, et recontacter les victimes lorsque le type fait d'autres victimes. En cas de récidive, ça devient plus pertinent d'utiliser le système judiciaire, et aussi beaucoup plus facile de faire une preuve au-delà de tout doute raisonnable.

Mais plus que tout, ça permettrait de redonner du pouvoir aux victimes sans augmenter le risque de fausses accusations.

Είναι χαραγμένες βαθιά στην ψυχή μου οι αρχαίες ελληνικές μορφές, σχήματα όσο και χώροι, μνημεία. Φεύγοντας από την Ελλάδα και ζώντας αρκετά χρόνια στο εξωτερικό κατάλαβα πόσο σημαντικές είναι αυτές οι επιρροές για μένα. Η τέχνη μου είναι ο τρόπος έκφρασης για μένα οπότε ήρθε σαν φυσικό αποτέλεσμα να φαίνεται στην εικαστική δουλειά μου αυτό το δέσιμο με την πολιτιστική κληρονομιά της Ελλάδας ως ο τόπος μου.

Έχω επίσης επηρεαστεί από πρωτόγονες αφρικάνικες αρχέτυπες μορφές και την κυβιστική εποχή στην τέχνη, αλλά όλα αυτά τα ερεθίσματα πρώτα φιλτράρονται από την αγάπη μου για την φύση. Πολλές εκφράσεις της φύσης είναι αυτούσιες στα δημιουργήματα μου όπως καρποί από δέντρα ή κάποια χαρακτηριστικά ελληνικών δέντρων και κάποια έντομα με συμβολικό χαρακτήρα όπως οι μέλισσες και τα τζιτζίκια.

Ποια μερίδα αγοραστών τα προτιμά συνήθως;

Η σύγχρονη γυναίκα με πολλαπλούς ρόλους στην ζωή και στην ψυχή της είναι ο συνομιλητής μου όταν σχεδιάζω. Θέλω να φοράει κοσμήματα και τις τσάντες μου από το πρωί σε επαγγελματικά ραντεβού μέχρι το απόγευμα σε κάποιο aperitivo ή και βραδινό φαγητό. Θέλω να αισθάνεται ότι έχοντας ντυθεί απλά, μπορεί να εκφράσει το στυλ της με αυτά τα χαρακτηριστικά αξεσουάρ που είναι από μόνα τους έντονα σε προσωπικότητα και αίσθηση. Φέτος παρουσιάσαμε και μαγιό που έχουν συνέπεια σαν στυλ στο DNA μας, μονοσήμαντα με διαχρονικό χαρακτήρα, διακοσμούνται με τις αλυσίδες ορόσημο του brand όπως και οι τσάντες μας.

Τι ήταν αυτό που σε οδήγησε να ασχοληθείς με το κόσμημα;

Έκανα την πρώτη μου εμφάνιση στο χώρο του κοσμήματος το 2009 με την επωνυμία της εταιρείας μου «my eye for design""», «myi4d». Από μικρή ήθελα να κάνω γλυπτική και δοκίμασα στο Slade School of Art ένα εντατικό summer course όταν ήμουν 22 χρονών και είδα ότι θέλω να συνδυάζω πάντα και την εμπορικη ανταπόκριση ή μάλλον να μπορώ να αισθάνομαι άμεσα την απήχηση του κοινού στις δημιουργίες μου, το οποίο γίνεται άμεσα στις πωλήσεις προϊόντων και όχι τόσο στα έργα τέχνης.

Είχα πάρει μαθήματα αργυροχρυσοχοΐας 4 καλοκαίρια στη σειρά τότε γιατί έβλεπα το κόσμημα σαν ευκαιρία έκφρασης του πάθους μου για την γλυπτική και μετά πήρα παράλληλα με το Master in business που σπούδαζα στο Μιλάνο, παρακολούθησα ένα χρόνο μαθήματα κατασκευής κοσμημάτων εκεί και κατάλαβα πόσο ήθελα να το συνεχίσω αυτό.

Βέβαια ιστορικά όταν το 2008 ήρθε η παγκόσμια κρίση και έστειλα τη συλλογή αντικών μου πίσω στην Αμερική τότε ήρθε και πρακτικά η ανάγκη να έχω στη γκαλερί στην Αθήνα κάποιο προϊόν με τιμή κάτω των 500 ευρώ και πέρα από τη γκάμα έργων τέχνης και αντικών, οπότε έτσι ξεκίνησε η σειρά με κοσμήματα και είδη δώρων. Με τα χρόνια τα δώρα έγιναν με μέση τιμή 80 ευρώ και έτσι δημιούργησα χειροποίητα κοσμήματα που ήθελα να ειναι μπρούτζινα επίχρυσα για να καλύψω αυτό το κενό στη γκαλερί μου και τελικά ξεκίνησα πιο μαζικά τη τάση στην Ελλάδα πρίν 16 χρόνια για ποιοτικά χειροποίητα γλυπτά - κοσμήματα χωρίς πέτρες.

Παρουσιάζουμε πρώτη φορά συλλογή απο δερμάτινες τσάντες που μόλις έγιναν διαθέσιμες αυτή την εποχή και γι' αυτό σκέφτηκα να τις παρουσιάσουμε στο ""The Pop up Project"" στο Golden Hall, απο τις 20 Οκτωβρίου μέχρι τις 11 Νοεμβρίου ώστε να υπάρχει χρόνος για το ελληνικό κοινό να μας γνωρίσει μέσα απο ενα άλλο καινούριο προϊόν αφού πέρσι παρουσίασαμε με επιτυχία τις πλεχτές αδιάβροχες τσάντες.

Η καινοτομία που αναφέρεις στις πλεκτές τσάντες είναι ότι είναι αδιάβροχες;

Γεγονός είναι ότι διεθνώς δεν έχουμε δει ακόμα άλλες χειροποίητα πλεχτές τσάντες διακοσμημένες με κοσμήματα ή περίτεχνα πλεγμένες αλυσίδες οι οποίες να είναι ταυτόχρονα αδιάβροχες. Αυτό τις κάνει πολύ ανθεκτικές, εύκολες στο καθάρισμα, ελαφριές και φυσικά τους ανοίγει τη κατηγορία all weather που καλύπτει πολλές χώρες με υγρό κλίμα και στην Ελλάδα αποτελούν μια ιδανική χειμερινή πρόταση σε αντίθεση με άλλες πλεκτές που δεν έχουν αυτά τα σημαντικά πλεονεκτήματα. Γι' αυτό έχουμε την ευκαιρία να της πουλάμε σε γνωστή αλυσίδα καταστημάτων στην Αμερική την ""Αnthropologie"".



Μίλησε μας για την έμπνευση της συλλογής σου με τις δερμάτινες τσάντες.



Ήθελα να προσφερω πολύ καλής ποιότητας δερμάτινες τσάντες, ανθεκτικές και λιτές που να φοριούνται όλη τη μέρα και αφιερώσαμε κάποια ειδικά σχέδια σε εκλεπτυσμένες τσάντες εργασίας. Σίγουρα το πλεονέκτημά μας στην ποιότητα στο χρόνο είναι ότι έχουν διπλή επένδυση δέρματος, πέρα απο τη κατασκευή τους.

Σε επίπεδο έμπνευσης συμπορεύονται με τα διαχρονικά μας θέματα. Άλλες τσάντες είναι διακοσμημένες με το γνωστό από τη συλλογή κοσμημάτων μας σύμβολο wishbone ή αλλιώς ""γιάντες"" και άλλες με κάποιο χαρακτηριστικό κόσμημα απο τις 3 θεματικές ενότητες που πιστά ακολουθώ τα τελευταία 13 χρόνια: τα κόκκαλα, τη δαντέλα και τους σπόρους/στοιχεία φύσης.

Hintergrund der Proteste: Vom 6. bis 17. November trifft sich in der ehemaligen Bundeshauptstadt die UN zur 23. Klimakonferenz. Das Interesse an der Konferenz ist groß, seit Donald Trump vor wenigen Monaten das Aussteigen der USA aus dem Klimaabkommen ankündigte.

Bereits am Samstag den 4. November kam es zu Protesten. Mehrere tausend Menschen fuhren mit dem Fahrrad von Köln nach Bonn, um ein Zeichen zu setzen. In Bonn trafen sich dann laut Veranstalter mehr als 25.000 Menschen auf den Straßen und demonstrierten für eine Klimawende und speziell den Kohleausstieg.

Mit dabei bereits hier: Das Bündnis Ende Gelände, das für Sonntag zu einer symbolischen Aktion im Hambacher Tagebau aufgerufen hatte. Ein Kohlebagger des Betreibers RWE sollte besetzt werden.

Am Sonntag kamen so schließlich mehr als 4000 Menschen in das Dorf Buir. Mit Staubmasken, Strohballen, Bannern und Gesang ging es in Richtung Grube. Zahlreiche internationale Demonstranten beteiligten sich an der Aktion - darunter viele Franzosen.

Elen, eine ältere Aktivistin aus Frankreich, erklärte: Die Menschen hier sind für eine Durchsetzung des Pariser Klimaabkommens. Mit Präsident Emmanuel Macron mache Frankreich Rückschritte bei der Klimapolitik. Zusammengefasst müsse man laut Elen sagen: ""Die Cop21 in Paris war ein kompletter Reinfall! Darauf müssen wir aufmerksam machen!“

Proteste für den Kohleausstieg vor Klimakonferenz Cop23

Ein Aktivist aus Argentinien, der lieber als ""Mr. Green“ bezeichnet werden will, erklärte seine Motivation, sich an den Protesten zu beteiligen, mit einem einfachen Wunsch: Er wünscht sich den Ausstieg aus der Kohlkraft.

Für ""Mr. Green"" steht außer Frage: Pazifistischer Widerstand ist seine Aktionsform. Die Polizei sei nicht sein Feind und es dürfe ganz klar niemand bei den Protesten zu Schaden kommen.

Auch laut Veranstaltern ist der gemeinsame Nenner, auf den sich alle Gruppen des Bündnis für diese Aktion geeinigt hätten, ganz klar pazifistisch: Die symbolische Blockade stehe im Vordergrund. Weder RWE-Anlagen, noch Mitarbeiter oder Polizisten sollten zu Schaden kommen.

Am Bagger in der Grube angekommen herrscht somit zunächst eine entspannte Stimmung. Es waren zwar Gräben ausgehoben und Wälle aufgeschüttet worden, um den Tagebau unzugänglich zu machen – die Polizei schritt zunächst jedoch kaum ein, um das Treiben zu stoppen.

Verzweifelt versuchten noch manche Beamte, die 30 Zentimeter tief im aufgeschütteten Sand standen, einzelne Aktivisten zu fangen.

Pressesprecher von Ende Gelände: ""Ich werte den heutigen Tag als großen Erfolg""

Der Pressesprecher von Ende Gelände stellte deshalb schon zu diesem Zeitpunkt fest: ""Ich werte den heutigen Tag als großen Erfolg. Es waren deutlich mehr Aktivisten vor Ort, als wir erwartet haben.""

Dem Bündnis sei es gelungen, die Grube zu betreten und sogar einen Kohlebagger zum Stoppen zu bringen. Dass der Bagger vor Ankunft der Aktivisten wirklich im Vollbetrieb lief, ist allerdings zu bezweifeln. Betreiber RWE hatte – zu sehen an den getroffenen Vorbereitungen – mit einer Aktion genau an diesem Bagger gerechnet und diesen wohl schon frühzeitig außer Betrieb genommen.

Dennoch: Die Demonstranten hatten alleine durch die Präsenz in der Grube einen Förderungsstopp erzwungen. Dann aber schritt die Polizei ein.

Polizisten reiten junge Frau nieder

Im Vorfeld der Demonstration hatte Dirk Weinspach, der Polizeipräsident von Achen, gesagt: ""Das Wichtigste ist mir, dass am Ende der Protestaktion weder Kolleginnen und Kollegen, noch Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten oder Unbeteiligte zu Schaden gekommen sind.“

De Polizei zeigte NRW dann aber ein anderes Gesicht. Mit einsetzendem Regen zog eine Pferdestaffel auf. Unter Einsatz von Pfefferspray und dem Umreiten von Aktivisten versuchten die Beamten, den Kreis der Demonstranten zu zerstreuen.

Quelle: Michael Trammer

Journalisten wurden mit Pfefferspray attackiert, der Einsatz des Schlagstock angedroht. So sagte ein junger Beamter zu einem Reporter, dieser solle sich ""verpissen"", sonst gäbe es ""auf die Fresse"". Besonders unschön war eine Szene, als eine junge Aktivistin von einem Polizisten erst brutal zu Boden gestossen wurde und dann ein Pferd auf ihren Oberkörper trampelte.

Die Polizistin auf dem Pferd rief danach noch: ""Das war keine Absicht!“ Von der Pressestelle der Polizei NRW war in der unmittelbaren Nähe der Aktion leider kein Ansprechpartner zu finden, um ein Statement zu den Vorkommnissen einzuholen.

Polizei NRW kündigt an, Einsatz von Pfefferspray zu untersuchen

Später bestätigte die Polizei NRW jedoch auf Twitter, dass es sowohl zu der Verletzung einer Person durch eines der Polizeipferde, als auch zu einem Einsatz von Pfefferspray gekommen sei.

Zuvor hatte die Polizei die Echtheit von Bildern eben jenes Einsatzes auf Twitter angezweifelt - nur, um sie später doch als echt zu bezeichnen.

Echtheit der Bilder Pfeffersprayeinsatz nicht geklärt - Ersteller bitte mit weiteren Bildern melden - Prüfung erfolgt durch #Polizei #Aachen — Polizei NRW AC (@Polizei_NRW_AC) 5. November 2017

Zum Ende wurde die Demonstration aufgelöst und Aktivisten in Busse der RWE-Power-AG verladen. Über Lautsprecher kündigte ein Beamter einen einstündigen Transport auf ein Revier an. Die Besetzung des Kraftwerks wurde beendet, der friedliche Protest von Ende Gelände beendet.

Am Ende überschattete Gewalt, was als politisches Signal an die Vereinten Nationen und für den Ausstieg aus dem Kohleabbau gedacht war.

Experts announced the find on Thursday but have admitted they don’t know what the cavity inside the pyramid, built as a monumental tomb around 2560BC, is for. To see inside the pyramid, the scientists used an imaging technique called muon tomography that tracks particles that bombard Earth at close to the speed of light and penetrate deeply into solid objects.

Scan Pyramids Mission Experts have admitted they don't know what the giant void in the Great Pyramid of Giza is for

They said the newly discovered internal structure was at least 100 feet long, and located above a hallway measuring about 155 feet long called the Grand Gallery, one of a series of passageways and chambers inside the immense pyramid. The researchers said it constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.

“What we are sure about is that this big void is there, that it is impressive, that it was not expected by, as far as I know, any kind of theory,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, president and co-founder of the HIP Institute in France, one of the leaders of the study published in the journal Nature.

Scan Pyramids Mission The void was discovered using cosmic particle detectors

“We open the question to Egyptologists and archaeologists: what could it be?” added Hany Helal of Cairo University. The Great Pyramid, looming alongside other large pyramids on the outskirts of Giza, is the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing. It soars to a height of 479 feet, the tallest structure built by humankind until the Eiffel Tower in Paris in 1889, and boasts a base measuring 754 feet.

Scan Pyramids Mission 3D scans with lasers and drones were also used as part of the investigation

It was constructed during the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops. Zahi Hawass, a previous Egyptian antiquities minister, believes the pyramid still contains the tomb of Khufu and that it is unplundered.

Ahead of the discovery, he told The Times: “I really believe that [Khufu’s] chamber is not discovered yet and all the three chambers were just to deceive the thieves, and the treasures of Khufu [are] still hidden inside the Great Pyramid.” The findings come from a project called Scan Pyramids that relies on non-invasive scanning methods to probe the internal structure of the pyramids of ancient Egypt’s glorious Old Kingdom period and understand how they were built.

“We are not doing this mission in order to find hidden cavities,” Helal said. Muon particles originate from interactions between cosmic rays from space and atoms of Earth’s upper atmosphere. The particles can penetrate hundreds of yards into stone before being absorbed. Placing detectors inside a pyramid can discern cavities within a solid structure.

La brusca ridefinizione dello scacchiere geopolitico del Medio Oriente preoccupa le Nazioni Unite e la comunità internazionale. A due giorni dall'annuncio delle dimissioni, l'ex primo ministro libanese Saad Hariri è stato ricevuto dal sovrano saudita Salman bin Abdulaziz a Riad.

Hariri aveva annunciato la decisione di dimettersi lanciando un'accusa nei confronti di Hezbollah, il movimento sciita libanese, e del regime di Teheran di voler strangolare il Libano. Aggiungeva inoltre che il suo timore era quello di subire la stessa sorte del celebre padre, Rafiq Hariri, ucciso da un'autobomba nel febbraio 2005. Secondo quanto riporta al Arabiya, sarebbe stato sventato un attentato contro Hariri proprio pochi giorni fa.

Particolare rilevanza era stata data, inoltre, al fatto che l'annuncio del primo ministro libanese era stato dato nel corso di una visita in Arabia Saudita. Il leader di Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, ha definito le dimissioni di Hariri una decisione ""imposta"" da Riad. ""Non desideravamo che Hariri si dimettesse"" ha sottolineato Nasrallah.

Il ministro degli esteri iraniano Javad Zarif critica l'Arabia Saudita per le accuse rivolte nelle ultime 48 ore alla Repubblica islamica in merito alla presunta ingerenza iraniana in Libano e Yemen. Sul suo account Twitter, Zarif ha scritto: ""L'Arabia Saudita è impegnata in guerre di aggressione, bullismo regionale, comportamento destabilizzante e provocazioni rischiose, ma accusa l'Iran per le conseguenze"". In precedenza, il portavoce del ministero degli esteri iraniano aveva già respinto le accuse saudite all'Iran di esser dietro l'attacco missilistico yemenita contro l'aeroporto internazionale di Riad.

Il presidente libanese Michel Aoun ha convocato due incontri di alto livello riguardo la situazione finanziaria e della sicurezza del Libano per discutere le misure necessarie da adottare. ""Il fatto che tutti i dirigenti politici si siano uniti agli appelli alla calma rafforza la stabilità e preserva l'unità nazionale"", ha affermato Aoun, secondo il profilo Twitter della presidenza, assicurando che la classe politica libanese punta a garantire la stabilità del paese.

Il patriarca maronita, cardinale Bechara Boutros Rai, ha deplorato la decisione del premier libanese di annunciare le proprie dimissioni mentre era in trasferta in Arabia Saudita, e ha avvertito sull'urgenza di vigilare contro """"qualsiasi trama o intento di sabotaggio intesi a minare la stabilità del Libano"". Secondo quanto riferito da Fides, nell'omelia della messa celebrata ieri, il primate della chiesa maronita ha richiamato tutti a sostenere l'appello lanciato dal presidente libanese Michel Aoun affinchè venga protetta e rafforzata l'unità nazionale, mostrando pazienza e discernimento nelle scelte da prendere per impedire che il paese dei cedri sia risucchiato nella spirale di conflitti che continuano a tormentare gli scenari del Medio Oriente. Il libano - ha aggiunto il patriarca - non deve essere spinto ad allinearsi in maniera coercitiva ""in assi regionali o internazionali che non corrispondono alla sua natura, ai suoi valori e al ruolo che interpreta come elemento di cooperazione, stabilità e coesistenza nella regione mediorientale"".

Come spesso accaduto nella storia, il Libano si ritrova vaso di coccio tra vasi di ferro - Arabia Saudita, Israele e Iran - stritolato nella morsa del conflitto fra Sunniti, a guida saudita, e sciiti, a guida iraniana, oltre che acerrimo nemico di Israele. Sulla vicenda si è espresso anche il premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu che ha definito le dimissioni di Hariri un campanello di allarme per la comunità internazionale per quelle che sono le ambizioni dell'Iran nello scacchiere mediorientale. Preoccupazioni che vengono espresse da Antonio Guterres, segretario generale dell'Onu, il quale ha auspicato che ""tutte le parti concentrino gli sforzi per sostenere la continuità delle istituzioni dello Stato libanese, in conformità con la Costituzione e per salvaguardare la sicurezza e la stabilità del Paese. L'Onu resta determinata a sostenere la sicurezza, la sovranità e l'integrità territoriale del Libano"".

Secondo diversi media arabi, le epurazioni condotte in Arabia Saudita nell'ambito di una vastissima operazione anti-corruzione guidata dall'uomo forte di Riad, l'erede al trono Mohammed bin Salman, e le dimissioni di Hariri sono ""collegate"". Gli eventi rientrerebbero in un piano saudita-americano per creare una coalizione militare araba per lanciare ""in coordinamento con Israele"" un'offensiva militare in Libano contro le milizie sciite Hezbollah, uscite ""vincitrici"" dal conflitto siriano assieme ai loro alleati, il regime siriano e Teheran, entrambi nemici giurati sia della monarchia saudita che dello stato ebraico. A sostenere questo teorema sono attivisti sauditi, molte testate vicine all'Iran, ma anche giornali arabi ""indipendenti"" come Rai al Youm.","Hariri da re Salman, lo scacchiere prende forma in veste anti-Iran",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/06/hariri-da-re-salman-lo-scacchiere-prende-forma-in-veste-anti-iran_a_23268271/

Das Thema ist nicht neu. Bereits in den frühen 1960er Jahren gab es seitens der Telefonhersteller Vorzeigeprojekte mit Bildübertragung. Ich selbst habe damals noch keine Erfahrungen mit Bildtelefonie machen können. Es hatte sich aber offenbar nicht durchgesetzt.

Vielleicht liegt es an dem Effekt, den man auch den Telefax-Effekt nennen könnte: Obwohl das Telefax bereits 1843 erfunden war, konnte es sich erst 130 Jahre später wirklich nennenswert verbreiten. Woran lag das? Nun, es gibt keinen Grund, ein Faxgerät zu kaufen, wenn man einer der ersten Teilnehmer an diesem Kommunikationsdienst ist. Schließlich müsste man viel investieren und könnte das Gerät kaum zum Einsatz bringen. So ging es auch dem Telefax: Die Kosten für ein Gerät waren hoch und die Chancen, einen Kommunikationspartner zu finden, gering.

Erst in den 1970er Jahren gelang der Durchbruch des Faxgerätes, wobei vor allem japanische Unternehmen diesen Siegeszug verursachten. Endlich gab es ein Medium, mit dem die komplexen japanischen Schriftzeichen sicher übertragen werden konnten. Der massenhafte Erfolg des Faxgerätes in Japan brachte erschwingliche Preise und schließlich eine weltweite Verbreitung.

Video im Vertrieb - Welche Technik eignet sich?

In unserer Zeit haben fast alle Menschen einen Computer im beruflichen Einsatz. Und mindestens genauso verbreitet sind Smartphones, die hervorragend als Endgeräte für Video-Kommunikation geeignet sind. Die Endgeräte sind also schon vorhanden und deshalb steht der Verbreitung der Video-Kommunikation nichts mehr im Wege - wenn man weiß, wie die Technik funktioniert.

Es gibt sicherlich eine große Anzahl von Systemen, mit denen man eine geeignete Verbindung per Video aufbauen kann. Hier möchte ich mich auf einige wenige beschränken, die aufgrund ihrer Verbreitung erwähnenswert sind.

Skype - eignet es sich für Vertrieb per Video-Kommunikation?

Das Unternehmen Skype ist inzwischen im Microsoft-Konzern aufgegangen. Der Name hat sich vielerorts als Kategorie-Begriff durchgesetzt. „Lass uns skypen"" versteht man als Aufforderung, statt dem Telefon die kostenlose Kommunikation per Internet zu wählen.

Um teilnehmen zu können, benötigt man ein Konto bei Skype und bekommt dann ein „Skype Handle"". Das ist ein eindeutiger Name, der aus zusammenhängenden Buchstaben und Ziffern besteht. Bevor man sich kontaktieren kann, muss man sich gegenseitig autorisieren. Das verhindert SPAM und Missbrauch, ist jedoch für Neulinge mühsam zu verstehen. Vielleicht ein Grund, dass sich Skype nur relativ langsam verbreitet. Inzwischen geht man von etwa 1,3 Milliarden Nutzern weltweit aus.

Kürzlich wurden auch Gruppenkommunikationen mit mehr als zwei Teilnehmern möglich, sodass es jetzt einen wesentlichen Nachteil gegenüber Wettbewerbern ausgleichen konnte.

Google Hangouts ermöglicht Video-Kommunikation in Gruppen

Zehn Jahre nach Skype kam Google mit seinem Video-Kommunikations-Dienst Hangouts auf den Markt. Um ihn zu benutzen, benötigt man lediglich ein Google-Konto.

Darüber hinaus ist der Dienst von Google mit Skype vergleichbar, auch wenn er noch weitere Funktionen bietet, die wir später noch behandeln werden.

Zoom bietet einen Meetingraum für den Vertrieb

Meine bevorzugte Lösung für Video-Kommunikation im Vertrieb ist derzeit zoom.us. Es ist kostenlos, wenn man nur mit einem Gesprächspartner kommunizieren will. Bei mehr als zwei Teilnehmern ist die Gesprächsdauer auf 40 Minuten beschränkt. Die einfachste kostenpflichtige Variante bekommen Sie ab 15 Euro. Dann sind bis zu 100 Teilnehmer möglich.

Der besondere Vorteil: Nur einer der Teilnehmer benötigt ein Konto beim Anbieter. Also können Verkäufer sich ein Konto anlegen. Die anderen Gesprächspartner benötigen nur einen einfachen Link. Wenn man darauf zum ersten Mal klickt, wird automatisch eine Software installiert. Das gilt auch für Smartphones. Dann kann man einfach teilnehmen. Alle Beteiligten können eigenständig ihre Kamera und Mikrofon ein- und ausschalten. Ebenso können alle Teilnehmer ihren Bildschirminhalt übertragenen und so beispielsweise Präsentationen allen andern Teilnehmern zeigen.

Die Video-Meetings können automatisch aufgezeichnet werden. Nach Ende der Video-Konferenz dauert es einen kurzen Moment, dann ist eine Video-Datei verfügbar, die das Gespräch und alle Video-Inhalte enthält. Das kann sehr hilfreich sein, wenn man das Gespräch im Nachgang dem Kunden zur Verfügung stellen möchte.

Sales on Camera - So gelingt Vertrieb per Video

Jeder weiß, was zu tun ist, um zu Telefonieren. Bei der Kommunikation per Video sind die meisten Menschen ungeübt. Deshalb hier einige Ideen, um per Video besser zu verkaufen.

In unseren Tagen ist die Kommunikation per Video - zumindest privat - an der Tagesordnung. Jeder kann irgendwie damit umgehen. Denken wir. Ausgebildete Kameraleute schlagen verzweifelt die Hände über dem Kopf zusammen, wenn Sie so manche Videonachrichten sehen. Das muss aber nicht sein. Hier einige einfache, aber wichtige Informationen.

Perspektive erzeugt Emotionen

Die Kamera entspricht im Videogespräch dem Auge des Betrachters. Wenn Sie über Webcam kommunizieren, ist die Webcam das Auge des Kunden. Achten Sie deshalb darauf, dass die Kamera auf gleicher Höhe zu Ihren Augen ist.

Wenn Sie eine normale Haltung einnehmen und einen Notebook verwenden, ist das Bild Ihrer Bildschirm-Kamera nicht optimal, weil es von unten kommt und Ihr Gesicht verzerrt. Wenn Sie einen Notebook verwenden, sollten Sie ihn deshalb besser auf einen Stapel Bücher stellen.

Noch besser ist eine USB-Kamera, die man auf ein Stativ montieren kann. Dann ist die Höhe sehr gut einstellbar. Augenhöhe ist auch aus psychologischer Sicht wichtig.

Wenn die Kamera zu nah ist, kann Ihr Gesicht verzerrt wirken. Stellen Sie die Kamera lieber etwas weiter weg. Wenn Sie die Variante mit dem Notebook auf dem Bücherstapel wählen, sollten Sie eine zweite Tastatur und eine Maus einplanen.

Hintergrund für Video-Kommunikation

Ein neutraler, weißer Hintergrund ist optimal. Bitte keine auffälligen Bilder im Hintergrund. Ihre Gesprächspartner wären abgelenkt.

Für die Beleuchtung ist es wichtig, dass der Hintergrund ähnlich hell ist, wie Ihr Gesicht im Vordergrund. Ein helles Fenster hinter Ihnen ist ebenso schlecht, wie ein dunkler Raum. Für eine gute Video-Kommunikation sollten Sie gut erkennbar sein und kein besonderer Helligkeitskontrast zum Hintergrund bestehen.

Licht für das Verkaufen per Video

Wenn Sie eine weiche, gleichmäßige Ausleuchtung suchen, ist eine großflächige Beleuchtung mit wenig Abstand ideal. Direkt vor einem Fenster sitzend - mit dem Blick dorthin - haben Sie eine gute Ausleuchtung, wenn das Fenster keine direkte Sonneneinstrahlung hat.

Abends sollten Sie eine Lampe nutzen, die Sie anstrahlt. Je größer die Fläche des Leuchtkörpers ist und je näher am Gesicht, je weicher wird das Licht. Umgekehrt erzeugt weit entferntes Licht mit kleiner Fläche ein hartes Licht, das sehr harte Schatten wirft (beispielsweise ein Halogenstrahler an der Decke).

Ton ist entscheidend, wenn Sie per Video verkaufen

Machen Sie beim Ton keine Kompromisse. Ideal ist eine Kombination aus Kopfhörern und einem Großmembran-Mikrofon. So können Sie mit geringem Abstand zum Mikrofon viele Umgebungsgeräusche ausblenden und Ihre Sprache ohne Hall und Rückkoppelung übermitteln.

Ich selbst nutze das Rode Podcaster, das man einfach an einem USB-Anschluss nutzen kann.

Die nächstbeste Variante ist ein Headset mit Mikrofon, das über USB oder den Kopfhöreranschluss angesteckt wird. Eine Variante über Bluetooth ist nicht so optimal, weil es bei Funkübertragung immer kleine Übertragungsverzögerungen gibt (Fachchinesisch: Latenzen), die dann zu Hall und anderen akustischen Störungen führen können. Bei wichtigen Verkaufsgesprächen per Video würde ich nach heutigem Stand der Technik noch immer ein Mikrofon und Headset mit Kabel nutzen.

Verhaltensregeln für das Verkaufen per Video

Verändern Sie Ihre Sprechweise nicht künstlich und verhalten Sie sich wie am Telefon. Jetzt dürfen Sie zusätzlich noch beachten, dass Sie möglichst immer in die Kamera blickten und nur noch peripher den Rest Ihres Bildschirms sehen. Das gilt zumindest so lange, wie Sie selbst sprechen oder Ihr Kunde spricht. Kurze Unterbrechungen des Augenkontakts sind ok, aber ohne diesen - wenn auch virtuellen - ist es kaum möglich eine Bindung zu erzeugen.

Wenn Sie Husten müssen, oder es kurz laut in Ihrem Umfeld wird, können Sie temporär mit einem Klick Ihr Mikrophon stumm schalten und später wieder aktivieren.

Sie sollten auch darauf achten, dass die Internetverbindung während der Unterhaltung nicht unnötig belastet wird. Dazu können Sie alle Programme beenden, die im Hintergrund das Internet nutzen. Typische Bandbreitenfressen sind: Dropbox, E-Mail und andere Programme, die ohne Ihr Eingreifen Dateien synchronisieren.

Scheitern an der Technik - Wie einfach ist es für den Kunden?

Egal mit welchem System Sie arbeiten wollen - wichtig ist, dass Sie dem unerfahrenen Kunden eine Anleitung zukommen lassen, damit er - ohne sich zu blamieren - an der Video-Konferenz teilnehmen kann. Am besten, Sie finden online eine Anleitung in der passenden Sprache oder Sie schreiben selbst eine.

Wie bereits erwähnt ist Zoom.us meine aktuelle Wahl, weil man als Teilnehmer einfach mit einem Klick auf einen Link teilnehmen kann. Aber auch hier gibt es Hürden: Manche Unternehmen blockieren aus Sicherheitsgründen das Installieren von zusätzlicher Software auf den firmeneigenen Notebooks. Daran kann auch eine Video-Kommunikation mit Zoom scheitern. Am besten Sie geben dem Kunden die Gelegenheit, es vorher zu testen.

Auch für Skype und Hangouts kann es Blockaden geben, weil manche Unternehmen Streaming generell aus dem Unternehmensnetz verbannt haben.

Eine Alternative wäre die Nutzung eines Smartphones. Alle genannten Dienste bieten jeweils eine App für iOS und Android an, mit der man einfach teilnehmen kann. Allerdings muss auch diese erst einmal geladen werden.

Wenn alle Stricke reißen, wäre auch eine Einwahl per klassischem Telefon möglich. Wegen des dann fehlenden Bildkanals wäre das ein Rückschritt. Aber wenn ein einzelner Teilnehmer dabei sein will, im Moment jedoch auf Reisen ist und nur so teilnehmen kann, ist das ein akzeptabler Kompromiss.

Alle hier genannten Dienste bieten die Möglichkeit, Bildschirminhalte zu übertragen. Auf diese Weise können Sie Präsentationen mit Powerpoint & Co. leicht vorbereiten und Ihren Teilnehmern zeigen. Auch andere Inhalte Ihres Bildschirms können auf diese Weise mit einer Gruppe besprochen werden.

Weil beispielsweise bei Zoom daraus automatisch eine Aufzeichnung entsteht, die man herunterladen und ggf. weiterbearbeiten kann, ist es auf diese Weise sehr einfach, einmal durchgeführte Präsentationen ganz oder teilweise auch Dritten zur Verfügung zu stellen.

Verkaufen per Video - Ihre Botschaft geht um die Welt

Google Hangouts bietet mit der Option „on Air"" eine Möglichkeit an, die Inhalte der Video-Botschaft sofort an eine breite Öffentlichkeit auszustrahlen. Gleiches bietet auch Facebook Live. Beide Varianten lassen es auch zu, dass der Teilnehmerkreis beschränkt wird, beispielsweise so, dass nur die Mitglieder einer bestimmten Facebook-Gruppe die Inhalte sehen können. Wenn Sie Erfahrung mit Messen, Roadshows und Konferenzen als Werkzeug für Vertrieb und Marketing gemacht haben, können Sie diese Technik nutzen, um zusätzliche Teilnehmer hinzuzufügen, die live nicht teilnehmen können. Sie müssten lediglich diese Möglichkeit zur Teilnahme ankündigen und vor Ort die Technik dafür schaffen. Für geringe Zusatzkosten können Sie so eine ganze Menge mehr Teilnehmer einbinden.

Wir dürfen die neuen Möglichkeiten nutzen, um dort, wo es sinnvoll ist, das Telefon abzulösen und vielleicht sogar Geschäftsreisen zu ersetzen. Gegenüber dem Telefon können wir sicher die Wirkung der Kommunikation verbessern. Und dort, wo man Geschäftsreisen einsparen kann, werden nicht nur Kosten gespart, sondern vor allem die unproduktiven Reisezeiten verringert. Auch wenn der direkte persönliche Kontakt sicher besser ist, kann man so die ein oder andere Reise durch eine professionell gemachte Video-Konferenz ersetzen.

NEW DELHI -- India may announce measures next week to help traders and small businesses who say a new nationwide goods and services tax (GST) has increased their tax and administrative burden.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if there is consensus at the next GST council meeting due over November 9 to November 10, the government would take the necessary steps to help traders and strengthen the country's economy.

A panel of ministers last month recommended reducing tax rates for small businesses and traders and raising the minimum revenue threshold for companies that need to pay tax, local media reported.

The launch in July of the long-awaited GST, which transformed India's 29 states into a single customs union, has left thousands of small and medium-sized firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

Modi is facing criticism for the disruption to the economy caused by the roll-out of GST and the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year. As a result of these issues India's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll found.

Modi's comments came days after India jumped about 30 places to 100th on the World Bank's ""Ease of Doing Business"" rankings, reflecting reforms in accessing credit, power supply and the protection of minority investors.

Modi said he expected India's ranking to improve next year when the GST and other reforms were considered.

""There are many other reforms that have already happened but need gestation and stabilization time before they are taken into account by the World Bank,"" Modi said.

He added that there were other reforms on which India and the World Bank would need to find common ground.

In her typically down-to-Earth style Sophie Monk didn't hold back with HuffPost Australia's Editor-at-Large Lisa Wilkinson during their Facebook Live chat on Monday.

Wilkinson grilled her on all the rumours and headlines around her new relationship with publican Stu Laundy who she met through the most recent season of 'The Bachelorette'.

""It was a massive risk,"" Monk said, worrying the whole experience would backfire on her, ""I thought Australia was going to hate me"".

""I'm known as being funny and silly, no one wants to see a serious side of someone and I'm emotional in it and a lot of the guys I was like, 'Oh my god I'd never date them'... it was pretty stressful.

""It's so weird, but my whole life's not normal anyway. I've never really had normality since I was a teenager. I've never had a normal life, I've never had a normal job.""

Not shying away from any questions Monk talked at length about her relationship with Laundy, which has made several -- not always entirely correct -- headlines. From a shock pregnancy to breaking up, Monk and Laundy have been filling up the tabloids as fans of the show scrutinised even the tiniest hints of body language.

""At the end of the day you just need someone that makes you laugh and happy,"" Monk said, ""I know some of the other guys might have been more on paper good for me but chemistry is everything.

""I really wanted to think with my head but I just couldn't help it, you've got to follow your heart.""

Monk's star is on the climb but she revealed it took time to get to where she is after returning from Los Angeles three years ago she lost everything.

""A friend of mine ripped me off, but ignorance -- law is not fair -- so I've built everything back up now on my own so I'm more grateful for it. I think you have to lose it all, have that down to enjoy the high as well.""

Taking viewer questions, Monk admitted she was ready to take a break from the world of reality TV.

""I think I'm done with [reality shows]... I'll do my own travel show, reality style. I really loved the experience but I think I'm done now.""

Monk said her next venture would hopefully be producing her own travel show with her best friend where they'd break down the realities of social media.

""It's ridiculous being famous and social media nowadays. We all fake it. I order a bottle of Verve, take a photo and take it back and get a cheaper bottle just to look good for social media,"" Monk told Wilkinson.

Fairfax Media can reveal Mr Alexander's father, Gilbert Alexander, was born in the UK and is likely to have conferred citizenship by descent to his son. Mr Alexander has never before been named as an MP with a parent born overseas, meaning his status has flown under the radar since the citizenship saga first erupted in July.

The Liberal member for the Sydney seat of Bennelong has confirmed he never renounced any British citizenship before entering Parliament, and cannot say definitively whether his father did so before the former tennis champion's birth in 1951.

This means he could be ineligible for Parliament under section 44 of the constitution.

A spokesman for Mr Alexander said on Monday: ""He believes his dad renounced his UK citizenship in the 41 years he lived in Australia before John was born. But of course he will fully participate in the process that the PM has just announced today.""

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday revealed all federal politicians will be required to publicly detail their citizenship history under new transparency measures designed to end the crisis.

The claim that Mr Alexander's father may have renounced at some point after he arrived in Australia in 1911 is complicated by the fact the concept of Australian citizenship did not come into force until 1949.

That means he may have only had a two-year window to renounce before his son was born in 1951.

Under the online renunciation search tool provided by the British National Archives, there is no record of Mr Alexander's father having renounced at any time after 1948.

Gilbert died in 1987, aged 80.

Fairfax Media has obtained documents that show Gilbert was born in Essex, England in September 1907. He was baptised in London the following month.

An incoming passenger card shows Gilbert and his family travelled from London to Sydney on June 9, 1911, when Gilbert was aged three. He enrolled to vote in the seat of Warringah in 1930 at age 23, and married Mr Alexander's mother, Thelma Fletcher Hipgrave, in 1944. They had John in July 1951.

Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born to British citizens are automatically given citizenship of the UK by descent.

This law conferred British citizenship on the Nationals' Fiona Nash and One Nation's Malcolm Roberts, who were kicked out of the Senate by the High Court last month. Former Senate president Stephen Parry resigned from Parliament last week after revealing he was a dual UK citizen through the same law.

Asked if he was confident he would not lose any more Coalition MPs to citizenship issues, Mr Turnbull said on Monday: ""The federal director has told me that all of the Liberal Party members believe that they are in compliance with the constitution.""

Mr Alexander won Bennelong, a culturally diverse electorate on Sydney's north shore in 2010, defeating sitting Labor MP and former ABC broadcaster Maxine McKew. He was reelected at the 2013 and 2016 federal elections. Mr Alexander holds the seat with a margin of 7.8 per cent.

The Turnbull government is down one lower house seat while former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce fights a byelection in his NSW seat of New England.

In a statement issued on Monday night, Mr Alexander's spokesman said: ""My father was born in the United Kingdom in 1907, before moving to Australia as a very young child.

""He became an Australian citizen as soon as he could. I understand he renounced his British citizenship before I was born, because he was a proud Australian."" i",Citizenship crisis: Turnbull government MP John Alexander may be a dual citizen,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/another-liberal-mp-could-be-a-dual-citizen-turnbull-governments-headache-continues_a_23267777/

ISIS described the attack in its weekly Al-Naba newsletter as ""one of the most prominent attacks targeting Crusaders in America,"" and a response to its call to target ""citizens of the Crusader countries involved in the alliance against the Islamic State."" The publication also called the alleged assailant, who is in police custody, a ""soldier"" of the group.

It's a pattern seen before, although the militant group waited longer than it typically does to claim responsibility. ISIS also tends to release the news via its Amaq news agency after a flurry of activity among pro-ISIS online accounts.

Police said Wednesday that the suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, acted in the name of ISIS and had been planning the attack for several weeks. Notes found at the scene point to Saipov's belief that the militant group would ""endure forever.""

While recovering from a gunshot wound at a hospital in New York, Saipov asked investigators if he could display ISIS flags in his room, according to a complaint released by the U.S. Attorney Southern District of New York. In court papers, prosecutors noted Saipov said ""he felt good about what he had done."" The suspect had planned to put ISIS flags on his vehicle but later thought better of it, afraid it would draw attention to him, the complaint said. Saipov's cellphones contained about 90 videos and 3,800 photos, many related to ISIS, The Associated Press reported. The images included ISIS prisoners being beheaded, shot or run over by a tank.

The group's intricate involvement in each attack differs. It is currently unclear to what extent, if any, ISIS was involved in planning or inspiring the attack in New York.

Esta historia comenzó entre náuseas y desmayos cuando Rafael tenía 25 años y al caminar por la calle se fatigaba constantemente ""como si corriera un maratón"", el primer indicio de un martirio que le quitó su juventud.

Insuficiencia renal crónica en fase terminal fue el diagnóstico que le dieron los médicos de una clínica del Estado de México para mandarlo inmediatamente a sesiones de hemodiálisis cada tres días.

""Nunca se me habló de un trasplante ni de la posibilidad de que eso podía cambiar mi vida"", dijo, y añadió que la hemodiálisis ""es un tratamiento que puede ser agresivo, algo que tampoco te explican"".

Un día se le comunicó que necesitaba urgentemente varias transfusiones de sangre pues sus niveles de hemoglobina estaban muy bajos (cinco gramos por cada decilitro), por lo que su esposa y su madre acudieron a un hospital de Ciudad de México para obtenerla.

Allí les aseguraron que su pariente ya estaba en lista de espera para obtener un trasplante, aunque sin recibir ningún número de referencia. Pasaron siete años.

""Esos siete años me los pasé con la ilusión de que me iban a llamar para un trasplante"", recordó Espino.

Un día, por un dolor en el corazón, Espino acudió de nuevo al mismo hospital de la capital, donde se le canalizó al departamento de trasplantes y se le solicitó el número de referencia que asigna el Centro Nacional de Trasplantes (Cenatra) tras unos estudios protocolarios de compatibilidad. La familia no tenía tal número.

Esto le sacó de la ceguera. ""Se puede decir que viví siete años engañado. Nadie me dijo que iniciara ningún protocolo"", aseguró el joven, protestando de la falta de tacto del sistema de salud.

""Hay un órgano para ti""

La donación de órganos y tejidos en México aumentó 75 % en el periodo 2010-2016 aunque todavía hay mucho por hacer en la materia, afirmó en octubre pasado el secretario de Salud, José Narro.

En la actualidad, 13 mil mexicanos están a la espera de la donación de un riñón y otros 7 mil de una córnea, según la Secretaría de Salud.

Tras realizar pesados trámites burocráticos y costosas pruebas de compatibilidad, casi por justicia poética, tras entrar a la lista de espera correcta solo pasó un mes y 20 días cuando recibió ""la llamada que todos esperan"", la que te dice: ""Hay un órgano para ti"".

""Después de ser trasplantado acudí a mi sala de hemodiálisis, digo mi sala porque viví siete años ahí, y di una plática. Les dije que se trasplantaran"", contó.

La etapa posterior no es fácil, ya que son tres meses de toma de inmunosupresores para que el órgano no sufra rechazo del organismo. No es posible trabajar y, por tanto, quienes no cuentan con seguro social no perciben ningún ingreso, lo que conduce a una situación de aislamiento en ocasiones desesperada.

Indicó que su esposa tampoco podía salir a trabajar porque él requería ayuda constante. ""No podía salir de un aislamiento donde ella me alimentaba, me llevaba el agua y todo"", recordó.

Alejandra García es la persona que le acompañó en todo este proceso apenas un año después de su casamiento, y que, según contó, resultó complicado ya que conlleva ""aprender a vivir también con una enfermedad que no sientes físicamente"".

""Vivir con una persona que en cualquier momento puede darle un infarto o ya no va a amanecer un día es una de las peores cosas de la vida"", reconoció.

Sobre el sistema de salud pública, la joven denuncia el conformismo, que prefiere anestesiar con fármacos que dar esperanza. ""Ya mejor dele sus mejores días y espere a que se muera, mejor ahorre el dinero para su funeral"", aseguró que le dijeron en el hospital.

La presidenta de la fundación Trasplante y Vida, Carolina Silva, habló sobre las vicisitudes que pasan algunos pacientes que acuden a su institución, que colabora directamente con las instituciones públicas, y aseguró que ""en México falta cultura de la donación"".

""Hay mucha falta de información en los pacientes ya que se atienden en instalaciones públicas con cantidades ingentes de gente"", argumentó.

Sobre la lentitud en los procesos opinó que es algo que ""podríamos tener resuelto"" pero es ""la falta de cultura de los hospitales y la voluntad de hacerlo"" lo que rezaga el proceso.

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah authorities say a former Calgary Stampeders linebacker is suspected of killing his wife.

Prosecutors said in a news release Friday that Anthony D. McClanahan has been arrested but not yet charged in the death of Keri ""KC"" McClanahan. She was found Thursday in a Park City hotel with knife wounds to her throat.

Anthony McClanahan was charged Friday with child kidnapping. Authorities say the 46-year-old took his 8-year-old son from an Arizona school on Oct. 3 without the mother's permission, then travelled through Nevada and Utah.

He was apprehended in Utah on Oct. 12 and gave his son back. He bonded out of jail a week later.

McClanahan is being held without bail, and it's unknown if he has a lawyer.

Mother Mother knew that music was a career they wanted to pursue as kids in school. In fact, Ryan Guldemond and his sister Molly can pinpoint the exact moment when it all clicked for them.

The school's principal once asked them to perform in front of 600 people and that moment proved to be their career catalyst, Molly says.

""From that point I was like, 'This is what we're doing.'"" The minute their music involved more than just themselves was their moment of clarity, Ryan says.

Loving and living your life is being receptive to possibilities and bravely saying yes to opportunities when they come your way. Find out how Sun Life encourages Canadians to secure your life, so you can love and live the life you want. Learn more here.

But the journey to success for this Vancouver rock band wasn't as easy. The group has gone through name changes, personnel shifts and managed to forge their own path to success.

Now six studio albums and a decade into their career, Mother Mother which also includes Jasmin Parker, Ali Siadat and Mike Young, released their latest album ""No Culture"" in February. They've found balance and focus, they say in an exclusive interview with Gavin Brown for Sun Life Financial, and got here by being receptive to possibilities and bravely saying yes to the opportunities available to them.

It's the one piece of advice Parker gives younger artists that want to follow in the group's footsteps.

""Always believe in yourself,"" she tells Brown. ""Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it because you can. If I can do it, you can do it.""

And following that advice will be worth it, Jasmin explains. She talks about one powerful moment of connection she shared with an audience member during a performance, calling it one of the brightest parts of her job.

""She was like eyes closed, full-on...singing at the top of her lungs...It was so sweet and lovely that I actually choked up in the moment and I had to stop singing.""

The significance of what they do is never lost on the group. Each member understands the potential for impact they have and focus their efforts on creating music for others.

""While (music is) an inward journey, I find that it's really crucial that I'm looking outward and being receptive to other people's stories and other portraits of humanity to draw inspiration from,"" Ryan says.

It's the same type of openness Ryan and Molly demonstrated when their principal asked them perform all those years ago and the group's biggest source of joy. It's the thing that makes a career in music worth it.

In an account that a distressing similarity to those of the dozens of women who’ve accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, de la Huerta said the former studio executive forced himself on her in October 2010 after offering to drive her home following a night out. Back at de la Huerta’s New York City apartment, she said, Weinstein removed her dress and raped her.

“Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” the actress told Vanity Fair. “Then he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid ... It wasn’t consensual ... It happened very quickly ... He stuck himself inside me ... When he was done he said he’d be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.”

After the incident, de la Huerta said Weinstein repeatedly tried to contact her by phone, prompting the actress to confront him at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles.

She said the second incident occurred about a month later at her home, after Weinstein showed up in the lobby of her building following a photo shoot. De la Huerta recalled being intoxicated that evening and unable to give consent.

“I was in no state. I was so terrified of him,” she told the outlet. “I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He’s like a pig ... He raped me.”

De la Huerta first met Weinstein when she was only 14 years old, having been cast in “The Cider House Rules,” which was produced by Miramax, the company Weinstein helped run at the time. The actress is likely best known for her role as Lucy Danziger, the one-time girlfriend to Steve Buscemi’s character on the HBO gangster saga “Boardwalk Empire,” which premiered a year prior to the first alleged rape.

De la Huerta said the assault put her down a dangerous path, damaging her career as she experienced depression and developed a dependence on alcohol.

“I was very traumatized,” she said. “I felt so disgusted by it, with myself ... I became a little self-destructive. It was really hard for me to deal, to cope.”

Jenny Lewis fotografiert Mütter mit ihren ein Tage alten Babies

Sie ist selbst Mutter und will anderen zeigen, dass sie keine Angst vor der Geburt haben müssen

Die Bilder zeigen allesamt starke, glückliche Mütter, denen die unbändige Liebe für ihr Kind deutlich anzusehen ist

Der Geburt eines Babys ist einer der prägendsten Momente im Leben einer Frau. Viele werdende Mütter begleitet in den Wochen davor neben all der Vorfreude auch ein ängstliches Gefühl.

Die Fotografin Jenny Lewis will ihren Teil dazu beitragen, dass die schönen Gefühle überwiegen. Mit einem Fotoprojekt One Day Young will sie schwangeren Frauen zeigen, dass eine Geburt nichts ist, vor dem man Angst haben muss.

Die Bilderstrecke zeigt verschiedene Mütter mit ihren Neugeborenen. Die Fotos sind alle am Tag nach der Geburt aufgenommen.

“Als ich Mutter wurde, hatte ich das Gefühl, dass ich anderen schwangeren Frauen sagen muss 'Alles wird gut!'"", sagte Lewis der HuffPost UK. Sie selbst ist Mutter von zwei Kindern. Ruby ist acht Jahre alt und Herb sechs.

Das Buch über eine Hebamme änderte alles

""Oft hört man von all den furchtbaren Dinge, die bei der Geburt schief gehen können. Bevor ich mein erstes Kind bekam, habe ich nicht eine positive Sache gehört"", beschreibt die Mutter ihre damalige Situation.

""Ich dachte, alles dreht sich nur um Periduralanästhesien und Krankenhäuser. Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich es genießen könnte, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

Helen und Hudson

Das änderte sich, als eine Freundin ihr ein Buch über die Hebamme Ina May Gaskin zeigte. ""Das Buch beinhaltet Kurzgeschichten über die Frauen, die sie betreut hat"", sagte Lewis.

“Diesen Frauen ging es gut. Sie haben die Wehen überstanden und ihre Ängste überwunden. Plötzlich habe ich gemerkt, wie sich meine Gedanken änderten und was es wirklich bedeutete, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 30 Fotos zeigen, dass Hebammen die Welt zu einem besseren Ort machen

""Nur wenige sagen 'Weißt du was? Ich habe die Geburt tatsächlich genossen. Es hat mir Selbstbewusstsein gegeben. Das war das schönste Gefühl, das ich jemals hatte'"", sagte Lewis. Dabei gebe es viele Frauen, die genau diese Empfindung hätten - sie zum Beispiel.

Jenny und Suki

""Das soll keineswegs die Erfahrungen von Frauen klein machen, die eine schwere Geburt hatten. Aber es muss Stimmen von beiden Seiten geben"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Ich wollte Teil von der anderen Seite sein - ein Teil einer Geschichte, über die andere vielleicht auch stolpern, so wie es mir mit Ina May passiert ist. Eine Geschichte, die die Balance zwischen den Seiten herstellt und Frauen vielleicht auch ein bisschen die Angst nimmt.""

""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte""

Mit ihren Fotos habe sie den den Moment nach der Geburt festhalten wollen - und zeigen, dass die Frauen danach immer noch sie selbst sind. ""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte.""

""One Day Young"" war geboren.

Alle Frauen, die auf den Bildern zu sehen sind, haben sich auf Lewis' Facebook-Aufruf gemeldet.

Einige kontaktierten die Fotografin auch, nachdem sie ihre Flyer in kleinen Läden und an Laternen gesehen hatten.

“In diesen ersten 24 Stunden kommt die innere Kriegerin der Frauen zum Vorschein. Sie bekommen diese Kraft, um ihr Kind zu beschützen und das sieht man auch auf den Bildern"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Sie sind wie diese heldenhaften Bilder von Soldaten auf dem Schlachtfeld oder ein Fußballspieler nach dem gewonnenen Spiel, noch voller Adrenalin. Dieser Moment wird selten festgehalten. Aber das, was sie erreicht haben, ist mindestens genau so wichtig wie das Tor oder der gewonnen Kampf - und dieser Moment verdient es, in einer Arena aufgenommen und gefeiert zu werden.""



Xanthe und Louie

Für sie ist jede Frau auf jedem Bild einzigartig - und doch verbindet sie etwas. ""Jeder hat seine Probleme, aber in diesem Moment werden sie unwichtig und jede ist gleich - auf einer Augenhöhe. Es ist egal, ob ich die Frauen in einer Villa oder in einem Hostel fotografiere. Der Blick in den Augen der Frauen ist immer der gleiche: Sie sind stolz auf sich selbst.""

This means better REM sleep may make people less prone to trauma or fear-related health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder.
They also believe REM sleep can reset the build up of norepinephrine to normal levels.

A new study shows that rapid eye movement, the stage of sleep where dreaming occurs, may help the brain better respond to stressful situations.

Research published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that people who spent more time in REM sleep during the night showed lower fear-related brain activity when exposed to mild electric shocks the following day. The results suggest that getting good REM sleep can help protect a person from “enhanced fear,” the study authors wrote. This means better REM sleep may make people less prone to trauma or fear-related health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder.

Researchers aren’t quite sure why this effect occurs, but they theorize it could have something to do with the production of norepinephrine (a hormone associated with stress), Time reports. The hormone can affect the amygdala, which is the fear center of the brain, making you more sensitive to stimuli that cause fear.

The study authors told the publication that the area of the brain that releases norepinephrine takes a break during REM. They also believe REM sleep can reset the build up of norepinephrine to normal levels.

The study is far from the first to reveal the benefits of a good night’s rest, particularly the importance of REM. Previous studies have found that the REM stage of sleep produces cognitive benefits needed to function when you’re awake.

“The pattern of brain activity [during REM] is remarkably similar to the wake stage. It’s quite active,” Rebecca Robbins, a sleep and behavioral change researcher at NYU’s School of Medicine (who was not affiliated with the study), told HuffPost. “The brain waves look similar to when you’re sitting in a class and learning new material.”

Of course, all of this information is well and good but it means nothing if you can’t get a good night’s sleep. We culled research and Robbins’ advice on the best ways to optimize your sleep (including that REM stage). Here are some tips:

However, the honest among us should not hide the fact that the crisis of education in South Africa remains the crisis of poor communities.

Apartheid policies have left a large legacy of school infrastructure backlogs in what were formerly black areas, compared to which provision in formerly white schools appears relatively lavish, with schools provided with well-equipped laboratories and qualified teachers. As it was under the apartheid state, education for black people is far from ideal.

Investments continue to be made in well-resourced areas, rather than in the areas that actually need to be invested in. Disparities within the education system are still an issue, despite the fact that there are plans –– like the National Development Plan (NDP) 2030 or Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (ASIDI) –– to improve education and foster future human prosperity.

In November 2013, the Department of Basic Education (DoE) published legally binding standards for school infrastructure. The department gave itself three years to achieve its goal. In November 2016, an investigation by Equal Education into the state of 60 schools across Eastern Cape found that 17 of the 60 schools visited were ""substantially inappropriate"" for education purposes, while 46 of the 60 schools had at least one ""inappropriate"" structure.

There are schools in Eastern Cape that still have no access to water, electricity or sanitation. Sometimes classes are held outside, because classrooms are not adequately maintained by the department. There are places where learners get mugged on their way to school, because there is no school transport.These were some of the findings revealed in the Equal Education (EE) 2015/2016 annual report.

Though South Africa is investing in the improvement of education, the nation is not investing in the social services that are imperative to ensure socio-economic justice and equality. In order to achieve a successful education system, the South African DoE should focus strictly on the most basic needs, such as infrastructure and sanitation.

#ReBuildASchool is an open-call campaign to everyone in South Africa to contribute towards building progressive education in South Africa.

Moreover,the DoE needs to look into developing capacity within the teaching force, strengthening relationships of accountability and support amongst stakeholders throughout, sharpening accountability through better information to parents and education authorities, improving understanding of the language issues, and lastly, improving the quality of Early Childhood Development (ECD) facilities –– because emphasis needs to be placed on a bottom-up approach, starting in the ECD phase.

Implementation of the above-listed suggestions will require careful planning, strong leadership and dedication. But without this, deep-seated educational change is merely wishful thinking.

The NDP Chapter 9 states that it ""will ensure that all vulnerable families will receive access to comprehensive childhood development services, free education, nutrition plans, improved school infrastructure, and quality teachers"". As an #NDP2030 Ambassador, it is with this in mind that I have decided to pledge to #ReBuildASchool one brick at a time.

#ReBuildASchool is an open-call campaign to everyone in South Africa to contribute towards building progressive education in South Africa, by assisting me in my journey to rebuild schools that have poor sanitation and infrastructure across the country.

The campaign will be launched on 15 November 2017.

JAIPUR -- ""Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally,"" this proverb by famous writer and journalist David Frost rightly suits Aabhas Sharma, the child prodigy who has cleared the higher secondary exam conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) at the age of 12.

Aabhas scored 325 out of 600 marks, scoring 65 percent to get a first division in the class 12th exam, the results of which were announced on Monday evening.

Two years ago, he became a celebrity in town when he passed class 10 at the age of 10.

""There was no pressure on me. I used to study at my will and play. I did not study class prep. I started my schooling from class first and I also jumped one or two primary classes,"" he told ANI.

Jubilant with such an outstanding performance, Aabhas said how his family and his school teachers extended him full support throughout the exams.

""There was full support from my family as well as my teachers. I used to study only one night before the exam. I was hundred percent confident that I will get through,"" he added.

Born on 26 August, 2003, this wonder boy from Jaipur aspires to become a doctor and serve the nation.

However, the 12-year-old boy has only one regret that he cannot appear for PMT (Pre Medical Test) before the age of 17 as the rules don't allow him to do so.

His father, Sachin Sharma, also the director of Aabhas Public Senior Secondary School in Jaipur's Durgapura area, says he never pressurised his son and always used to encourage him.

""He gave his exams without any pressure. Today evening, when results were about to come, he asked me as to what will happen. I told him to relax and said that what will happen, it will happen for the good. He studied only overnights,"" he said.

""He scored 61 percent marks in class 10th. From there on he got the confidence that he could clear class 12th. We never pressurized him to study,"" he added.

Dabei ist ein Abfangversuch äußerst riskant

Trump will sich bei seiner Asienreise außerdem mit dem russischen Präsidenten Putin treffen

US-Präsident Donald Trump ist zu Beginn seiner fast zweiwöchigen Asienreise in Japan eingetroffen. Einige hundert amerikanische und japanische Soldaten bereiteten ihm am Sonntagvormittag (Ortszeit) auf dem US-Militärstützpunkt Yokota einen begeisterten Empfang.

""Japan ist ein geschätzter Partner und wichtiger Alliierter, und wir danken ihnen für ihre Freundschaft"", sagte Trump.

Nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur Kyodo soll er jedoch im Vorfeld Unverständnis für Tokios Reaktion auf zwei kürzliche Raketentests durch Nordkorea geäußert haben. Er könne nicht verstehen, warum ein Land von Samurai-Kriegern die Raketen nicht abschoss, soll Trump gesagt haben.

Dabei wäre sowohl ein erfolgreicher als auch ein gescheiterter Abschuss äußerst gefährlich.

""Japan will der Eskalation wohl aus dem Weg gehen""

Der Abfang einer Rakete - gerade einer Interkontinentalrakete - gilt als große Herausforderung. Die USA testeten im Mai 2017 ihr Raketenabwehrsystem ""Ground-based Midcourse Defense"" (GMD) - mit einer Erfolgsquote von 53 Prozent, wie das Pentagon mitteilte.

Das japanische Verteidigungsministerium habe sich nach der Berechnung der Flugroute der nordkoreanischen Raketen dazu entschlossen, keinen Abgangversuch zu starten, berichtet die japanische Tageszeitung ""Japan Times"". Ein Fehlversuch würde Japan blamieren und Nordkorea womöglich zu weiteren Test ermuntern, so die Überlegung.

Ein erfolgreicher Abschuss könnte außerdem die Situation eskalieren lassen. ""Einen Abschuss hätte Nordkorea umgehend als Provokation und Anlass für zeitnahe weitere Raketentests gesehen, dieser Eskalation wollte Japan wohl aus dem Weg gehen"", zitierte der ""Spiegel"" einen ranghohen Bundeswehroffizier nach einem kürzlichen Raketentest der Nordkoreaner.

Trump will sich mit Putin treffen

Der gefährliche Konflikt um das Atomwaffenprogramm in Nordkorea wird eines der zentralen Themen der zweiwöchigen Asien-Reise von Trump sein. Darüber wird er am Montag auch mit dem japanischen Ministerpräsidenten Shinzo Abe in Tokio sprechen.

Seine erste Asienreise wird Trump von Japan aus weiter nach Seoul führen, nach China, Vietnam und auf die Philippinen. Trump erwartet während seiner Reise auch ein Treffen mit seinem russischen Kollegen Wladimir Putin.

""Ich denke, es wird erwartet, dass wir uns mit Putin treffen"", sagte Trump am Sonntag auf der Reise nach Tokio an Bord der Air Force One mitreisenden Reportern. ""Wir wollen, dass Putin mit Nordkorea hilft, und wir werden eine Reihe verschiedener Anführer treffen"", sagte Trump. Die beiden Präsidenten haben sich zuletzt am Rande des G20-Gipfels in Hamburg getroffen.

Ein Treffen Trumps mit Putin am Rande eines Gipfels der Asiatisch-Pazifischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft (Apec) in Da Nang in Vietnam war von russischer Seite bereits ins Spiel gebracht, vom Weißen Haus aber bislang nicht bestätigt worden.

Trump selbst hatte vor der Reise dem Sender Fox News gesagt: ""Das ist eine sehr wichtige Reise. Wir können uns mit Putin treffen."" Eine endgültige Bestätigung eines Treffens steht gleichwohl noch aus.

On devient des citoyens engagés, présents, et pas seulement des gens qui apprennent à être des citoyens.
On n'est plus dans la survie, mais dans la vie.
Je ne fais pas à manger quand je n'ai pas à cuisiner pour eux.","Certains livres de recettes sont élaborés avec un tel souci esthétique qu'ils sont à la fois pratiques et magnifiques. Le livre de Kim Thúy va plus loin encore. La nourriture étant l'un des moyens prisés des Vietnamiens pour exprimer leur affection, on sent à travers les pages de cet ouvrage une ode aux saveurs et aux odeurs. On découvre grâce au travail de la photographe Sarah Scott – et quelques sublimes photos d'archive – des extraits d'une culture fascinante, sa beauté, sa richesse, ses nuances et son âme. On jouit d'un accès privilégié à la famille de la plus célèbre Vietnamienne du Québec, à ses tantes et à sa mère, à la vie qui défile sur leurs visages, marqués par une histoire que l'écrivaine nous dévoile bribe par bribe, dans ses romans et dans ses recettes.

Pourquoi est-ce important pour toi de transmettre la culture vietnamienne aux Québécois?

« Le bon verbe, c'est « partager », parce que je la découvre presque en même temps. Je sais que tel poème existe, car je connais une phrase ou deux. Mais la différence entre toi et moi, c'est que je sais que ça existe, alors je vais le chercher, j'en découvre davantage et je veux partager la beauté que je découvre. Autant dans les romans que dans les plats. Par exemple, un chef m'a expliqué que la cuisine française ne combine jamais le porc haché et les crevettes. Ce ne sont pas deux goûts qu'on met ensemble pour eux. C'est l'une des particularités de la bouffe vietnamienne. Je l'ignorais. »

Depuis le début des vagues d'immigration vietnamienne au Québec, votre culture fait sa place peu à peu. Est-ce que je me trompe, si j'affirme que c'est particulièrement le cas depuis 10 ans?

« C'est vrai! Parce qu'on commence à avoir une voix. On est capable de mettre des mots sur ce qu'on a traversé, sur ce qu'on vit et sur notre vision du futur. On devient des citoyens engagés, présents, et pas seulement des gens qui apprennent à être des citoyens. On n'est plus dans la survie, mais dans la vie. La différence est là. Récemment, j'ai retrouvé une amie de mon primaire. Quand on s'est revues, elle ne me reconnaissait pas, même si elle se rappelait de son amie vietnamienne et de mon nom complet. J'ai réalisé qu'à l'époque, je ne parlais pas français et qu'elle ne connaissait rien de moi. Je n'avais pas de voix. Quarante ans plus tard, nous sommes dans la vie. Les Vietnamiens sont engagés à tous les niveaux, en politique, en art, en affaires, etc. »

Tu as été propriétaire d'un restaurant dans le passé. Est-ce que ça te manquait de consacrer une grande partie de ton temps à la cuisine vietnamienne?

« Pas du tout! J'ai ouvert le resto parce que je croyais que personne ne m'engagerait comme avocate. Je me suis inventé un emploi. Je n'ai pas du tout cet amour-là. Quand mes enfants ne sont pas à la maison, les légumes gèlent dans le frigo. Je ne fais pas à manger quand je n'ai pas à cuisiner pour eux. La cuisine est toujours dirigée vers les autres. »

Tu écris dans le livre que toutes les attentions que tu portes pour nourrir les tiens est ta façon d'exprimer l'affection que tu ne verbalises pas. Explique-moi.

« Ce n'est pas dans nos habitudes de dire « je t'aime », « tu me manques » ou « je suis fier de toi ». Mes parents ne disent pas ça. Quand je voyais les Québécois se dire ça, je trouvais ça l'fun, mais je me suis posé la question : « Si on ne se le dit pas, est-ce qu'on s'aime moins? » Mais non! Il y a plusieurs façons de montrer son affection. Pour moi, ça passe beaucoup par la nourriture. J'essaie de créer des souvenirs avec les saveurs, d'aller dans la mémoire des gens au point où ça fait partie de leur ADN. Par exemple, la sauce à spaghetti, il n'y en a pas une meilleure que celle de ta mère. Ça n'a rien à voir avec la sauce, mais avec l'amour que tu ressens pour elle et qui a grandi pendant 10 ou 20 ans. En quelque sorte, je suis en train d'implanter dans la tête de mes enfants des parties de moi. Cuisiner, c'est presque contrôler la mémoire de l'autre. C'est vicieux, ces p'tits Viet-là! »

Comment expliques-tu qu'un livre surtout composé de recettes ait la capacité de toucher les gens?

« Il y a eu un moment de bonheur durant sa création. Pourtant, c'était un projet exigeant, qui impliquait énormément de monde, dans ma maison qu'on a transformée en studio, et ce, dans une période de temps très limitée. C'était chaotique! Mais lors de la dernière journée, la photographe est partie en pleurant. Elle ne voulait pas que ce soit terminé. Ses photos ont capté ce grand moment de complicité. On a réussi l'exploit que ça transparaisse. »

Au fond, c'est tellement plus qu'un livre de recettes.

« On voulait partager le bonheur qu'on a à être ensemble. Ma mère a 73 ans et mon père 78 ans. Sur les photos, on voit le travail du temps sur eux, leur fragilité. C'est un miracle que j'aie toutes mes tantes avec moi. On n'est pas tous arrivés au Canada en même temps ni de la même façon. Il y a tellement de familles vietnamiennes qui ont perdu des membres en cours de route. Je réalise à quel point j'ai la chance que ma famille soit vivante et dans mon quotidien. »

Les recettes vietnamiennes sont des secrets sensibles et jalousement précieux, transmis de génération en génération dans la discrétion. Comment as-tu convaincu ta famille de divulguer vos secrets?

« D'abord, le livre ne révèle pas tant ces secrets. Je partage des recettes de base qui font partie de notre quotidien, alors je n'ai pas eu à convaincre ma famille. Ils m'ont dit oui aveuglément. En fait, même si on n'est jamais d'accord sur rien, on se soutient inconditionnellement. Quand j'ai ouvert mon restaurant, tout le monde était en désaccord, mais ils ont tous investi de l'argent et lavé la vaisselle. Mon oncle, qui est vice-président d'une grosse compagnie, s'est mis à quatre pattes pour laver le plancher, afin que tout soit prêt le lendemain. Un de mes frères quittait sa clinique dentaire plusieurs fois sur l'heure du diner pour venir laver la vaisselle. Peu importe le projet, ils sont là. »

Bei Sondierungsgesprächen geht es eigentlich ums Antasten, ums Kennenlernen, Vertrauen aufbauen. Die Jamaika-Sondierungen erscheinen dagegen bisweilen wie ein offener Schlagabtausch.

Auch Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck ist genervt davon, wie wenig konstruktiv einige Politiker der verhandelnden Parteien die Gespräche angehen. Im Gespräch mit dem ARD forderte Habeck deshalb, Handys bei den Verhandlungen in Zukunft vor der Tür zu lassen.

""Man hat teilweise eins zu eins online lesen können, wie man gerade redet"", sagte Habeck in der Sendung ""Bericht aus Berlin"" am Sonntagabend. Vertrauen sei da ""ein seltenes Gut"". Sein Vorschlag: ""Wir legen alle unsere Handys draußen vor die Tür und holen die nach zwei, drei Stunden wieder.""

Auch im ""Handelsblatt"" appellierte Habeck an die Sondierer, sich mit öffentlichen Aussagen über ein mögliches Scheitern der Gespräche zurückzuhalten. ""Wir sollten uns nun darauf konzentrieren, gemeinsame Ergebnisse zu erzielen und das Neuwahl-Gerede endlich einstellen“, sagte der Kieler Umweltminister.

""80 zu 20 Chance, dass es klappt""

Dennoch glaubt Habeck, dass Jamaika letztendlich zustandekommt. ""Vernunftbegabte Menschen müssen versuchen, es hinzukriegen"", sagte der Grünen-Politiker – und bezifferte die Chance einer Koalition auf 80 Prozent.

Auch in in der Union wächst die Sorge, dass die Verhandlungen platzen könnten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel warnte davor, immer wieder eine vorgezogene Neuwahl für den Fall des Scheiterns ins Spiel zu bringen. Auch die CDU müsse ein Jamaika-Bündnis nicht um jeden Preis eingehen, sagte die Kanzlerin am Montag nach Angaben von Teilnehmern in einer Sitzung des CDU-Vorstands in Berlin.

Nach einer am Montag veröffentlichten Forsa-Umfrage im Auftrag der Mediengruppe RTL würde sich das Ergebnis bei einer Neuwahl kaum vom Resultat der Bundestagswahl vom 24. September unterscheiden.

SONEBHADRA -- A German national was allegedly beaten by a railway contractor at the Robertsganj railway station in the district, police said today.

The incident comes days after a Swiss couple were attacked near the railway station at Agra's Fatehpur Sikri.

Holger Ereek was allegedly beaten by railway contractor Aman Kumar yesterday after which the station master informed the police.

Circle officer Vivekanand Tiwari said that the accused has been arrested.

However, the railway contractor alleged that when he greeted Ereek by saying ""welcome to India"", he hit him.

The victim refused to talk to the media.

On October 22, the Swiss couple from Lausanne in Switzerland, Quentin Jeremy Clerc (24) and his girlfriend Marie Droz (24), was chased and attacked with stones and sticks by a group of five youths in Fatehpur Sikri, triggering widespread outrage.

The couple was quoted as saying in a media report that they were strolling near the station at Fatehpur Sikri after a day in Agra when a group of youths started following them and later attacked.

The couple said as they lay on the ground bloodied and bruised, bystanders began taking videos of them on their mobile phones, the report said.

All the accused were arrested.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had sought a report from the UP government on the attack.

Union Minister of State for Tourism K J Alphons had dashed off a letter to Yogi Adityanath, saying the incident could have a negative impact on the image of the country.

Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police Sulkhan Singh had issued a list of guidelines, including deployment of policemen in plain clothes, more patrolling and installation of CCTV cameras, to prevent such incidents.

The couple were also offered a free stay in 5-star hotel in the national capital as a ""token of concern"" by Alphons.","After Attack On Swiss Couple, German Man Allegedly Assaulted In UP",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/05/after-attack-on-swiss-couple-german-man-allegedly-assaulted-in-up_a_23267074/

She had her first suicidal thought at age 5 — her mother had yelled at her seemingly out of nowhere, and it shook her in a profound way. By age 11 she had smoked marijuana for the first time, quickly picking up a habit. Soon, she was drinking alcohol and using drugs regularly with a group of kids from her neighborhood.

""I loved the ritual of doing something you're not supposed to do. That was exciting to me,"" Olds told HuffPost. ""I liked the wild kids. It was almost like seeing something shiny and sparkly and going after it.""

Things took a dark turn at age 13 for Olds, who is now 55, sober and a full-time freelance writer based in New York. She was raped by five of the boys she'd been hanging out with and she developed a severe addiction to drugs and alcohol.

She was medicating her trauma, she explained, and trying to pretend the assault had never happened by preventing herself from thinking about it. (She's now working on a book project about sexual assault victims who were afraid to tell their stories and the effects of rape trauma.)

By age 26, Olds found that she couldn't keep a job, and her relationships were getting shorter and shorter. That's when her best friend and roommate stepped in to tell her enough was enough.

""I think I must have been up all night doing coke, and he must have known,"" she said. ""He shook me like a rag doll, and this vein on his forehead popped out and he started to cry and yell at me and he said, 'I am not going to watch you kill yourself — that's it. If you don't stop right now, I'm leaving. Do you hear me? I'm leaving.'""

Soon after, she got herself into a treatment center and started attending regular Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and has been sober ever since.

""It's a really hard thing to do, tough love, but I really think it's the only thing that seems to work,"" Olds said.

Tough love is one way to support a friend struggling with addiction, but there are others, too. And for the estimated 21 million Americans living with substance use disorders, support from friends could be the first step toward getting treatment.

Research has consistently found that support from friends is associated with positive outcomes ― including abstaining from drug and alcohol use, and remaining sober ― and tough love can in fact motivate people with substance use issues to seek treatment.

If someone you love is fighting an addiction, here are a few things you can do to offer them support:

Talk to your friend.

Sal Raichbach, a psychologist and chief of ethics and compliance at the Ambrosia Treatment Center, says that having an open, honest dialogue about addiction — when your friend is sober — can be an important move. Your friend might not respond well at first, but having a nonjudgmental conversation about your feelings and fears can open up a line of communication and, on some level, let your friend know they can talk to you.

""If the person struggling is in denial, is unwilling to admit the severity of their problem, or doesn't want to talk, it still leaves room for that communication to take place in the future,"" Raichbach said.

Start by letting your friend know you've noticed certain troubling behaviors, and tell them you'd like to address those behaviors. But always remember to keep judgment out of your voice.

""The best way to tell someone to get help without blaming or shaming them is to understand the disease of addiction before approaching them,"" Raichbach said. ""Their actions might be selfish, but behind those actions are a sick person.""

Never enable your friend.

Whatever you do, don't enable your friend's addiction — and that doesn't mean just refraining from alcohol or drug use around them (though you should do that, too). Based on her experience, Olds says that loaning money to someone with addiction or bailing them out of addiction-related jams can enable their drug or alcohol use.

Raichbach agrees, and adds that offering to lend an ear when your friend needs support, or helping to look for a treatment center if they don't know where to start, are good alternatives to enabling their addictions.

""Just don't work harder than they do at getting them sober,"" he said.

Consider an intervention.

If you're unfamiliar with the premise of an intervention, here's the gist: You get a loved one with a substance use problem into a room with others who love them, and you each explain the effect their addiction is having on your lives. You should have a therapist or intervention strategist present, and you might have resources ready to offer your friend, such as referrals to treatment centers or locations of AA meetings.

""Interventions can be a fantastic resource for getting friends and family the help they need,"" Raichbach said. ""They allow friends and family of the struggling individual, and often the individual themselves, to express their feelings and concerns in a constructive way — and make a plan [for recovery].""

You can learn more about how to stage an intervention here.

Consider tough love.

Olds says that while she knows relationships suffer when someone has an addiction, those people who do keep up friendships may at some point find that using a ""tough love"" strategy is the last option they have to help their friend get treatment.

""I know people in AA who have had to lock their kids out of their homes. They say, 'You're on your own,'"" she explained. ""They've tried everything — they've tried rehab, they've tried meetings, they've tried talking to them — and [the child] won't stop. I really think the only answer is to cut them off.""

Raichbach says that giving ""tough love"" can be emotionally challenging as a friend, but ""it can provide an essential push or incentive for them to seek help.""

Take care of yourself.

Being friends with someone living with an addiction is emotionally intense. Both Olds and Raichbach say it's important to take care of yourself while you're supporting your friend. Raichbach recommends setting boundaries and sticking to them, and Olds encourages friends of people with substance use disorders to attend support meetings as a way to understand the disease and hear from others facing similar struggles.

""The best thing you can do to help that person... is go to therapy and go to Al-Anon,"" she said. ""And if you go to therapy, go to somebody who understands addiction.""

Remain supportive while your friend is in recovery.

Once your friend has made the huge decision to enter treatment, continuing to support them is critical to their recovery. Olds says that reaching out, sleeping over if necessary, being there when your friend needs to talk or just bringing food are practical ways to help someone who's recovering from an addiction. And refraining from drug and alcohol use in front of your friend is not only respectful ― it's essential to your friend's well-being.

Molecules of glycogen contain water and therefore the more glycogen you store the more water you retain in the process.""
When it comes to carbs and retaining water, do healthy complex carbs (like whole grains, fruits and vegetables) result in less retention compared to simple, processed carbs (like chips, pizza and doughnuts)?
Speaking of sodium: as well as carbs, salt can make you retain water and look 'puffy', Spendlove and Lowe explained.","We can all agree that carbs are the best. Pizza, doughnuts, burgers, pasta -- whatever form it takes, carbs are comforting, satisfying and plain delicious.

Be that as it may, eating too many carbs can be a problem (sad, we know). One effect people report when overdoing the carbs is looking 'puffy' or like they're retaining water.

To find out if carb-related water retention is a thing, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

Do carbs make you retain water?

""Carbohydrate intake can lead to water retention,"" Jessica Spendlove, accredited practising dietitian and performance dietitian, told HuffPost Australia.

This is all because of the way carbs are stored in our bodies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some stored carbs play a role in providing energy between meals.

""Some of the carbs you consume are stored in the form of glycogen. For every one gram of carbohydrate stored in the body (as glycogen) there is approximately 2-3 grams of water retained.

""Glycogen is stored in your liver and muscles where it can quickly turn into glucose to provide energy when you need it. Molecules of glycogen contain water and therefore the more glycogen you store the more water you retain in the process.""

This bodily process explains why when people go on diets or restrict carbohydrate intake, they will see initial weight loss as ""water weight is lost with the loss of muscle glycogen"", nutritionist Steph Lowe of The Natural Nutritionist explained.

""This is why when someone commences a low-carbohydrate diet they appear to lose weight quickly according to the scales, as they deplete their glycogen stores which also results in them losing fluid as well. This is not actual weight loss and will rebound in a few days or weeks at most,"" Spendlove added.

Does the type of carb have a different effect on water retention?

When it comes to carbs and retaining water, do healthy complex carbs (like whole grains, fruits and vegetables) result in less retention compared to simple, processed carbs (like chips, pizza and doughnuts)?

""In terms of water retention, not necessarily, as it is more about the storage of carbohydrate in the body (as glycogen) which impacts how much water is retained,"" Spendlove said.

""In saying that, there is more of a chance a processed carbohydrate may have higher sodium amounts as well, which could enhance the water retained.""

Salty, carby snacks like chips can be a double whammy for water retention.

Does salt make you retain water?

Speaking of sodium: as well as carbs, salt can make you retain water and look 'puffy', Spendlove and Lowe explained.

""Sodium intake can definitely play a role in water retention,"" Spendlove said.

""Sodium helps regulate the levels of water in your body. As a result, the total amount of sodium (salt) you consume has an impact on whether you retain or eliminate water. As you eat more salt, your body holds onto more water. If you have too much sodium in your system, your body retains water.""

If you want to know if you are consuming too much sodium or carbohydrate check in with a GP or accredited dietitian or nutritionist.

Is water retention a sign you're consuming too many carbs?

According to Spendlove and Lowe, water retention may be indicative of an excessive carbohydrate intake but there are also other causes of fluid retention, including underlying medical conditions, which is why it's important to check in with your GP.

""There are many other potential explanations for water retention, including too little protein, hormonal imbalance and thyroid dysfunction,"" Lowe said.

Many medications, menstruation and hot weather can also cause water retention. Another explanation for feeling heavier is weight gain.

""If we eat anything in excess and are in an energy surplus (eating more than what we are burning) it will be stored as fat and we will gain weight,"" Spendlove said. ""If you eat excess carbohydrates and you are in energy surplus you will store the excess as fat.""

""Excess carbohydrates spike the fat storage hormone insulin, which leads to poor blood sugar control, imbalanced mood, cravings, 3.30-itis and weight gain,"" Lowe added.

Carbs aren't 'bad', but it's important to focus on quantity and quality.

To find out how many carbohydrates you should be eating per day, Lowe recommends going by a calculation of 15-20 percent of your total daily energy (calorie) intake if you lead a sedentary lifestyle. Or you can base the amount off your body weight.

""I tend to suggest no more than two grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight [per day], Spendlove said.

""If you are sedentary, I suggest making sure the carbohydrate part of your meal is the smallest (the biggest should be the salad and non-starchy vegetable component).""

A general rule to aim for would be ¼ of your plate protein, less than ¼ of your plate carbohydrate and at least ½ of your plate salad and non-starchy vegetables.

""It is important everyone, but particularly a sedentary person, to choose the best quality, slow-release types of carbohydrates in small quantities such as quinoa, sweet potato, brown rice and oats.""",Do Carbs Make You Retain Water?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/05/do-carbs-make-you-retain-water_a_23265193/

Ein Antrag, in dem mit Blick auf die Landtagswahl im Herbst 2018 ein ""personeller Neuanfang"" gefordert wird, wurde auf der Landesversammlung des CSU-Nachwuchses am Samstag in Erlangen mit deutlicher Mehrheit angenommen.

Bayerns Finanzminister Markus Söder lobte die JU: ""Es gibt immer mal wieder in der Geschichte der Union Landesversammlungen, an denen wird man nicht vorbeigehen können. Die haben eine Wirkung"", sagte der CSU-Politiker am Samstagabend. Söder gilt als aussichtsreicher Kandidat für die Nachfolge von Seehofer.

""Ich weiß, sowas fällt nicht leicht, und das muss man auch in Ruhe machen. Aber ich möchte euch wirklich sagen: Ich habe großen Respekt davor, was ihr für Verantwortung zeigt, welchen Mut ihr habt, was ihr euch traut"", sagte Söder an die bayerische JU gerichtet. ""Das ist eine Landesversammlung, und es ist eine Junge Union, die zeigt Rückgrat in der Partei. Meinen Respekt davor, toll gemacht.""

Un­ter­stüt­zung be­kam See­ho­fer unterdessen von CSU-Par­tei­vi­ze Man­fred Weber: ""Ge­ra­de als bür­ger­li­che Par­tei muss sich die CSU sehr gut über­le­gen, wie wir mit­ein­an­der um­ge­hen. In der Art und Weise, wie es die letz­ten Wo­chen ge­lau­fen ist, wurde be­reits Scha­den ver­ur­sacht. Die Men­schen haben ein fei­nes Ge­spür dafür, dass der An­stand ge­wahrt blei­ben muss. Ge­ra­de ein Mi­nis­ter­prä­si­dent ist eine Re­spekts­per­son.""

A new survey suggests millennials are leading a gradual resurgence of interest when it comes to attending Remembrance Day ceremonies.

The poll conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Historica Canada found that 29 per cent of respondents plan to attend a ceremony to honour fallen soldiers on Nov. 11, up three per cent from last year and marking a return to recent highs established in 2015.

But the online survey suggests Canadians between 18 and 34 are the ones most likely to pay their respects in person.

We're more aware of our place in the world, and that translates into greater appreciation of sacrifice in a global context.

The poll found 37 per cent of millennial respondents planned to attend a ceremony, well ahead of the 29 per cent of baby boomers over age 55 who were surveyed.

Just 23 per cent of survey participants aged between 35 and 54, classed as members of generation X, expressed an intention of going to an official ceremony.

Historica Canada says the surge in interest in attending Remembrance Day ceremonies may be the result of increased efforts to share veterans' stories in schools and other public spaces, exposing younger generations to real-life accounts of time in combat.

Veterans making impression on demographic with a 'bad rap'

Historica Chief Executive Officer Anthony Wilson-Smith said veterans relaying the horrors of war in person in Canadian schools, or sharing their anecdotes in online archives, have had a chance to make an impression on a demographic that often gets a ""bad rap.""

Wilson-Smith said both the survey results and his own experience suggest millennials are engaged and patriotic, adding that ready access to information beyond Canada's borders may also play a role.

""We're more aware of our place in the world, and that translates into greater appreciation of sacrifice in a global context,"" he said in a telephone interview.

The survey found that 73 per cent of participants have heard directly from veterans at some point in their lives.

Of those, 43 per cent said their exposure came either through a school presentation or through watching an archived account on film or online. Just 30 per cent said their interaction stemmed from conversation with a veteran they personally know.

Shifting demographics may also be driving the gradual rekindling of interest in Remembrance Day ceremonies, which appeared to hit a low back in 2008 when only 16 per cent of respondents to a survey held at the time indicated plans to attend one.

""We do see that very often, those who have come here from other countries have a greater appreciation for the values of this country and the things that people have gone through,"" he said. ""Because they come from countries, sometimes, that are war-torn themselves. They're grateful for this peaceful environment here, but also how it came to be that way.""

Didn't equate to wearing a poppy

Numbers from the Ipsos survey suggested, however, that plans to attend a ceremony did not necessarily equate with intentions of wearing a traditional red poppy.

Seventy per cent of millennial poll participants planned to don one compared to 72 per cent of gen X respondents and 88 per cent of those from the baby boomer bracket.

The survey of 1,003 Canadians was conducted online between Oct. 24 and Oct. 26.

It is imperative that we keep our nation intact, and the best way to do this is to foster ongoing social dialogue between stakeholders in society.

Such social cohesion could be built around 'mini-compacts' for example against the all-pervasive corruption, and the building of integrity and morality.
This may mean an elite compacting approach to social cohesion, perhaps around the central question of economic growth.","As we despair at the sight of our flag being burnt, students taking again to the streets, the state dysfunctional and rancour dominating our politics, South Africans cannot help but wonder: is the centre no longer holding? Regardless of what one sees as the core problem facing South African society, one of the greatest dangers we face is a loss of social cohesion.

This becomes all the more tragic when we remember we were the poster country for reconciliation and solving problems through dialogue. CODESA stopped being a noun and became a verb which we used as in ""Let's Codesa about that"". The pressure being brought to bear on society by poverty, unemployment and inequality, poor governance, a lack of growth and a concomitant erosion of domestic and international confidence threatens the relationships that hold the nation together and make dialogue difficult.

This is fundamental. The nation-building project, the idea of a developmental state, these cannot succeed when the nation itself becomes and remains fractured. It is imperative that we keep our nation intact, and the best way to do this is to foster ongoing social dialogue between stakeholders in society.

A climate of ongoing dialogue creates mutual understanding -- if not agreement -- and this is enough to hold a country together. As we have seen, gaining an insight into the diverging views of our fellow South Africans helps us to understand them, to empathise and it enriches the human connections that bind a group of people together. From there, almost anything is possible. A national consensus can be reached that respects the competing interests, the atmosphere of contestation that characterises a healthy democracy, but agrees on the needs of the country at large and keeps us moving forward.

How then to bring our disparate interest groups together to build a social compact? We are blessed to have several fora, platforms and initiatives where our country's various interest groups come together. This is reassuring, however, the fact that despite these, South Africa is spiralling down the plughole of zero growth, unemployment and state capture is not reassuring.

Nedlac, the National Economic Development and Labour Council, is an established forum for business, labour, government and community engagement. It has not brought many revolutionary solutions of late and may benefit from revision of its membership and mandate.

The multiparty negotiating process acknowledges that the alternative to debate is violence and is to be avoided at all costs.

The CEO Initiative was a trailblazing innovation that brought business leaders and government together to share insights and strategies to grow SMEs and youth employment, as well as to promote South Africa to investors and ratings agencies. Sadly, it lost momentum after the March 2017 cabinet reshuffle that saw Pravin Gordhan fired as finance minister.

There have also been purpose-driven summits that have brought stakeholders together towards a common goal. Here one thinks of the 1998 Jobs Summit, the 2003 Growth and Development Summit and the 2012 Social Cohesion Summit. In addition, the Accelerated Shared Growth Initiative (Asgisa) sought to leverage the booming growth of the mid-2000s to exponentially boost the fortunes of the poor and working classes. This was stymied by political developments and the global financial crisis, since when our growth trajectory has been flat at best.

While none of these initiatives has been the golden bullet that unites the country around a common strategy, they served to build faith in the multi-party approach to problem-solving. Indeed, our democratic country emerged from the multiparty Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) processes, so this approach has significant goodwill, even if it has still not been optimally revisited.

The multiparty negotiating process acknowledges that the alternative to debate is violence and is to be avoided at all costs. It accepts that compromise will be required to achieve agreement. It works through consultation and consensus, and it is further predicated on the understanding that agreement must lead to action and implementation.

Multiparty negotiations have also taught us what does not work -- stubbornly holding out for maximum positions, ideological fundamentalism, not communicating compromises to constituencies, and changes of government negotiators due to political upheaval. In its research report for the National Planning Commission, the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA) emphasised that the South African Constitution and the National Development Plan should form the basis of a working social compact.

The constitution is the secular covenant that enshrines our national values, the Bill of Rights and serves as the foundation of any social agreement. The NDP identifies key drivers of economic growth, including infrastructure, manufacturing, sustainable development, mining, agriculture, developmental activism by the financial sector, and small business development.

Social cohesion is at once an asset to be protected, and an indispensable tool with which to achieve transformation, policy direction, inclusive growth and representative democracy for all.

Zooming in from the macro approach, any workable consensus hoping to take South Africa forward needs to address specific issues like a national minimum wage, transport costs for workers, education and skills development and ways to contain the cost of living.

While the private sector and civil society have accepted that they need to take the initiative in trying to build these alliances, government, too, must come to the party and engage with such stakeholder initiatives. If the state does not pitch up, it will find that a bottom-up process of coalescing shall occur, and the agenda for transformation set from outside its ambit. Such social cohesion could be built around 'mini-compacts' for example against the all-pervasive corruption, and the building of integrity and morality.

None of these tactics is at odds with the NDP's vision 2030, and any initiative towards establishing a new multiparty, multisectoral forum would do well to use the NDP as a framework towards a workable consensus. This may mean an elite compacting approach to social cohesion, perhaps around the central question of economic growth.

Such a process could start with attempts to get key leaders agreeing on the core issues of the day and the danger of not acting on them, before ultimately bringing all groups together for cross-sector dialogue aimed at forging a social compact. Social cohesion is at once an asset to be protected, and an indispensable tool with which to achieve transformation, policy direction, inclusive growth and representative democracy for all.

At The Banking Association South Africa, we are intimately engaged with initiatives to build social dialogue at Nedlac, the CEO Initiative, BLSA, Future SA and our own Banking Summit. There cannot be enough of such initiatives. Social cohesion needs to be consciously nurtured and worked at, with all social stakeholders engaging within and between sectors to achieve the integrated consensus and shared national vision that our country always displays when it is at its best. Let's talk, and let's build SA together!

The writer/educator is craftily captured in Mahala's text and it is amazing that this is his first play. It is cleverly put together in a way that illustrates the struggling writer who wanted nothing more than to be a teacher which was blocked in every possible way shattering his only hope for a future in his beloved country. And while battling to fight the good fight, a bottle of brandy looms ever larger.

It explains much about his personality but also his life, and again reminds us that as in all these oppressive situations, survival is always tougher for those who have the ability to speak their minds -- something Themba did with such flair and fire.

Maake Ka-Ncube steps onto stage into a role that he obviously relishes and has refined in the time he has been touring with the production. It's great that it is being afforded more than just a single run because it tells such a personable and enlightening story about our past and people that should be honoured and remembered.

In this remarkable actor's hands, Themba comes alive in a way that is completely his own. There's nothing straightforward about the performance which turns into a dance as he moves between the writer and the man that finds his stories all around him from the shebeens to the Sof'town streets. As a bonus, he also does a heart-warming rendition of Madiba perhaps the results of his earlier turn in Rivonia Trial.

There's a strong beating heart with Cooke deftly using the solo performance in a way that is never static yet doesn't feel choreographed which is always the dilemma in these kinds of performances.

Not with these two stalwarts. With Cooke's experienced artistic vision and Ka-Ncube's performance skills, they do justice to Mahala's invigorating script in a way that's mesmerising and enthralling. One would have imagined that most of us would be as familiar with Themba as was possible, but this piece shows his life in a completely novel way -- with many life lessons to boot.

Apart from stricter editing which would allow for a slightly shorter show, it's a near perfect production and one that brings much joy -- from performance to storytelling of a personal kind which we need much more of.

Can Themba's voice is one that should be heard. And in this show, the volume is at its sharpest.

By Ashok Kumar*, Gumla, Jharkhand

In the first week of July, Birla Khariya from Silam village in Jharkhand, was busy planting robust tomato seedlings in his fields. He had bought 3,500 seedlings from Michael Ekka, who runs a vegetable nursery in a nearby hamlet. Earlier, Khariya used to buy a 10 gm pack of seeds to grow his own seedlings; but since last year, he has been purchasing from Ekka's nursery.

""Seedlings from Michael's nursery are resilient, treated and of genuine varieties,"" Khariya told VillageSquare.in. ""Apart from seedlings, the other farm inputs are also available at Michaels' place on easy credit."" Khariya finds it convenient; it also eliminates the risk of nursery failure.

Reduced risk and the convenience of getting many services at their doorsteps have enabled farmers like Khariya from Raidih block of Gumla district to gradually increase the area under vegetable crops. This has encouraged agricultural entrepreneurs like Ekka to introduce more services and innovative ideas that not only help their business but also help the farmers earn more.

Beyond Subsistence Farming

Raidih is an administrative block in the southwestern part of Gumla district in Jharkhand. Raidih is home to about 13,600 families, 65% of them being tribal people, as accounted by the Gumla District Census Handbook - 2011. Around 10,000 families have landholding of less than two hectares (ha).

Of the 30,500 ha of cultivated area, only 6% is irrigated. This implies that rain-fed rice cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the residents of Raidih block. The area gets about 1200 mm of rainfall every year spread over some 70 rainy days. Depending on rain-fed farming makes residents of Raidih practice only subsistence farming.

This and the absence of non-farm enterprises force them to migrate to distant cities in search of jobs and cash income. The younger generation also finds farming an unpredictable occupation and feels that cities hold better opportunities for them. Despite the capricious agricultural production system, the migrants return home during the rainy season to cultivate their fields. Clearly, they have an affinity towards farming and living at home.

Utilizing Opportunities

Located at around 650m above sea level, Raidih enjoys a mild climate. With a rolling topography and well-drained soil, it has a huge potential for subtropical crops, including vegetables, even in rainy season. This unique biophysical feature holds a good prospect for smallholders.

During the rainy season, the surrounding agriculturally progressive areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar are inundated and vegetables cannot be grown. Sensing this opportunity, some farmers started growing vegetables with support from organizations such as PRADAN (Professional Assistance for Development Action), a grassroots organization. As vegetables are in demand during the monsoons, the farmers find a good market.

Michael Ekka in his 40s is an active farmer from Silam Patratoli village of Raidih block. He is eager to learn and adopt new things in agriculture and has a general concern about the socioeconomic condition of his fellow villagers. Michael is supporting villagers to move towards prosperity from farming by becoming an agricultural-entrepreneur, or agripreneur.

One-Stop Shop

An agripreneur is like a one-stop shop in the village. He provides agricultural inputs, high quality vegetable seedlings, mechanized plowing devices like power tillers, small credit for farm inputs through microfinance institutions and information related to farming, besides facilitating collective marketing of vegetables and mangoes. This monsoon, Ekka helped 180 farmers grow vegetables for markets as far as Ranchi and Rourkela.

Michael was identified by the women's SHG (self-help group) of his village to take part in the agri- entrepreneurship program run by Transform Rural India (TRI), in collaboration with Syngenta Foundation India. Michael participated in several training programs on agriculture technology, achievement motivation, and business management among others. The training helped him build his perspective around agriculture, and he could see the opportunity for an enterprise around aggregating inputs demand and output marketing from the local area.

Michael understands that creating an ecosystem around the smallholders is important to sustain them in gainful farming. The rural tribal areas are acutely deficient in products and services required for profitable farming. The present scale and diffusion of agriculture technology is not attractive for conventional markets. Local entrepreneurship is essential to aggregate the demand and supply of farm inputs, services and outputs. It has to sustain the agripreneur, as well as help him stay competitive in the local market.

Challenges

Commitments are major challenges that Michael faces. Sometimes farmers do not take delivery of the ordered inputs or seedlings. When prices of produce are low, farmers dump the produce at Ekka's place, but when prices are high, they sell directly in the markets. After Ekka started taking advance for supply orders, the issue of farmers not taking the ordered inputs has reduced.

Providing assured supplies is still a challenge, but with increasing area under production by farmers, it is slowly being solved. With increased production, the quantity of produce is beyond a farmer's capacity to sell in the local market. So they rely on people such as Michael. Simultaneously, he tries to aggregate and market other local produce like jackfruits, mangoes and rice to keep his revenues right.

Pioneering New Ideas

Being closely associated with Mahila Vikas Mandal, an SHG federation, Michael was aware that his village is in a kharif tomato production cluster. More than 300 farmers around his village grow kharif hybrid tomatoes. So he started a nursery in kharif of 2016, producing 50,000 tomato seedlings. He used a bamboo frame structure with mesh nylon net to protect the seedlings from heavy downpours, insects and stray animals.

The demand for seedlings outstripped supply. Subsequently he produced two batches of seedlings for vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, chili and eggplant, booking a profit of about Rs 50,000 this year. His efforts drew the attention of the district agriculture department, and he bagged a commercial greenhouse for flower cultivation, where he grows gerbera. Michael also applied for and successfully obtained a seed and fertilizer dealer license.

In 2017, sensing the demand, Michael expanded his business, producing chili and brinjal seedlings in kharif, besides the tomato. He also got power tillers and mechanized paddy thrasher from the village organization (VO) and started lending services. His seed and fertilizer shop is also doing well, the turnover by July being more than Rs 70,000. From selling paddy seeds and fertilizers, he expects to make about Rs 30,000 by the end of the kharif season. The first batch of 60,000 seedlings was sold out and he was preparing the next batch.

In the summer of 2017, he provided collective marketing services for mangoes. Michael supplied mangoes to Ranchi and charged Rs 0.30 per kg from the farmers. The farmers were happy because the price was good, weighing was accurate, and it was a doorstep supply facility. For efficient marketing services, Michael has 250 plastic crates at his center for grading of produce, transparent weighing and easy transportation.

Michael is using a smartphone-based application Kushal Kisan, developed by TRI, to register farmers, facilitate crop planning and manage inputs delivery as well as providing credit through microfinance institution.

Facilitating Change

There are 22 such agripreneurs offering services similar to Michael's. In addition, they anchor access to micro irrigation. They are opening new frontiers like introducing kharif onions and flowers in their area. There are another 69 people in the process of becoming agripreneurs in three administrative blocks of Jharkhand.

Attracted by this rewarding enterprise, Michael's son has joined him in this journey of driving prosperity in the local area. ""My son has returned home from Himachal,"" Michael told VillageSquare.in happily. His son takes active interest in the farm equipment lending center and the vegetable nursery business.

In Michael's region, the expected returns are about Rs 2 million a year. It is evident that enabling the local entrepreneurs with relevant perspective, skills, linkages and mentoring support, it is possible to intensify the local production system profitably, sustain the local entrepreneurs, and stem migration.

BHOPAL -- The enraged survivor of the gangrape in Bhopal has demanded that the perpetrators be hanged publicly.

""Such people (culprits) should not be left alive. Police should hand out such a punishment that it does not happen with anyone ever again. In fact, they should be hanged on the streets,"" the survivor told ANI on Sunday.

Her rage was also directed towards the police who initially refused to lodge her complaint.

""The most disgusting thing was police's behaviour; we were going from one police station to another, we visited at least three to four stations,"" she said, adding that the Government Railway Police (GRP) and MP Nagar Police were the most disrespectful towards her.

""We faced this despite both of my parents being in police, so you can imagine what general public faces in such situations,"" she lamented.

The survivor further informed that her parents caught hold of the accused after she helped in identifying the culprits.

''We took the accused to the police station, he confessed to the crime and still the police did not book a complaint,"" she added.

She said it took a whole day for the family to get their complaint heard in different police stations, until the Habibganj Police showed some cooperation and support.

On Thursday, the 19-year-old civil services aspirant was abducted by four men and allegedly gangraped when she was returning home after attending her coaching class.

On Friday, three of the accused were arrested.

Investigation is on to nab the fourth one.

But unfortunately, in many fields, networking is a necessary evil. You're not going to make new contacts or meet new people from the safety of your cubicle.

So how can you survive the intimidating prospect of walking into a room of people you don't know (without burying your face in your phone the whole time) and network successfully?

HuffPost Australia spoke to Janine Garner, CEO, networking specialist and author of 'It's Who You Know' to find out.

HP: What do you think it is about networking that people hate so much?

Janine Garner: ""We hate networking because we have made it so hard -- we are overwhelmed with the choices available to network, it's becoming complicated with how, what and where, we are all stretched for time and given the superficial nature of most networking (insert business card swapping fest) we are over it and questioning the real purpose behind it.""

What makes someone successful at networking?

JG: ""Those that are successful at networking quite simply care. They care about the other person first and foremost, their success and what help they need.

""They engage deeply in conversation, are always curious about how they can help and make a point of following up and following through on any promises they make.

""Successful networkers understand that building relationships requires an investment of time, energy and interest and that it is a long game.""

What are the most common struggles people have with networking?

JG: ""The most common struggles people have revolve all around themselves and being in their own head -- 'I'm an introvert, I'm nervous, what do I say, how do I make sure I am interesting, what if I need to leave the conversation?'

""The obsession with self gets in the way. I suggest people have to get out of their own way and instead focus intently on the person they are speaking to, listen deeply to understand and concentrate on being present.

""And if you err on the introversion side follow your energy -- the worse thing you can do as an introvert is go to an event with thousands of people -- instead organise a lunch of six people or a coffee date -- that's networking. And if you have to go to that big event plan your exit time and be okay with having a deep conversation with one or two people.

What is the first thing you should do when you enter a networking event?

JG: ""For me its about preparation -- why are the attending the event, who else is going, who would you like to meet? When you enter the event start connecting straight away -- say hi to the person at the check-in, take a deep breath and say hi to the first person you meet -- quite simply start the conversation.

""And if you are worrying about what to say, ask them questions first to get them talking so you can ultimately find some common ground. Some great opening questions could be 'What brought you here today?' 'What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now in your business?' 'That sounds interesting tell me more'.""

This is not how to do it.

Any tips on how to introduce yourself/infiltrate a group of people who are already talking?

JG: ""Take a big deep breath, approach and simply say 'Hi my name is xxx, I'm here on my own today is it okay to join in your conversation.'

What are the biggest networking no-nos?

JG: ""We all hate those rubber-neckers -- you know the ones -- the ones that are talking to you, but not really listening, their eyes are looking around searching out who else is in the room that may be more interesting, more important or more influential.

""The biggest no-no is not to be present in that moment. Focus on who you are speaking with, be interested in what they are saying and remove all distractions.""

What should you do if the conversation is stilted/awkward?

JG: ""If the conversation is stilted and not going anywhere quite simply remove yourself from the conversation. You are at a networking function for a reason -- it's to meet people.

""Excuse yourself by going to get a drink or a trip to the bathroom. And its okay to explain that you came to this event to meet some new people, say it's been lovely to meet you and excuse yourself politely so you can go and meet some other people.""

Do people still hand out their business cards or is that not done any more?

JG: ""Some do, some don't. Networking isn't about handing out business cards -- it's about meeting people, connecting and sharing. LinkedIn is the worlds biggest rolodex!""

Any other tips you might have?

JG: ""Networking is a choice -- you can either choose to be superficial in your approach and realise the opportunity that exists when you build relationships through listening carefully and engaging in conversation.

Alla fine, sebbene il lento scrutinio avesse lasciato accesa l'ultima speranza, il verdetto è impietoso: per Alternativa popolare le elezioni siciliane sono una debacle. Un disastro soprattutto per Angelino Alfano e quell'area più filo governativa che ha voluto l'alleanza con il Pd a sostegno di Fabrizio Micari. Il leader centrista non nasconde il ""risultato negativo"", ma rivendica: ""Anche se non abbiamo ottenuto i risultati sperati, non abbiamo rimpianti perché abbiamo fatto la scelta giusta"".

Una scelta che, però, fu fatta a dispetto dell'ala nordista, guidata da Maurizio Lupi, che guardava al centrodestra e - anche a fronte del veto di Salvini - avrebbe comunque preferito una corsa solitaria. Una decisione che dunque si è rivelata fallimentare e che brucia ancora di più sulla pelle del ministro degli Esteri che nella natale Agrigento ha, o a questo punto aveva, il suo piccolo feudo. E che ora corre il rischio di ritrovarsi minoranza nel partito che lui stesso ha costruito.

Non superare il 5% vuol dire infatti non avere nemmeno un seggio, dunque neanche una briciola di potere contrattuale quando Nello Musumeci andrà a cercare ""rinforzi"" per formare il governo. Perché è esattamente questo lo scenario che prefiguravano molti notabili locali di Ap che in numerosi comizi, spudoratamente, chiedevano il voto per i propri candidati in lista, ma poi suggerivano di votare per il governatore del centrodestra. I dati lo confermano: il sostegno di Alfano ha portato a Micari poco e niente, al centro è risultata assai più credibile la proposta dell'Udc di Lorenzo Cesa per Musumeci. Ed ecco che sotto quella soglia, reale e psicologica allo stesso tempo, è già partito quel processo di disgregazione in realtà strisciante da tempo. I big per ora scelgono la strada della prudenza, Maurizio Lupi approfitta del provvidenziale viaggio a New York per la maratona, e sfrutta il fuso rinviando ogni commento.

Ma il dado sembra ormai tratto e la linea che emergerà è: basta alleanza con il Pd, bisogna guardare al centrodestra. Lo ""sfogatoio"" è già pronto: per sabato a Roma è in programma una conferenza organizzativa di Ap, e i ""critici"" già affilano le armi. Esplicitamente ne parla Roberto Formigoni: ""C'è un'unica cosa che Alternativa Popolare non deve fare dopo le elezioni siciliane: riproporre a livello nazionale - sostiene - l'alleanza con il Pd. È questa l'indicazione chiara che ci viene dai nostri elettori, sia pure a risultati non definitivi"". L'ex hovernatore lombardo invita anche a mollare il governo, già a cominciare dalla legge di bilancio.

Lupi, che proprio per scongiurare scollamenti Alfano ha nominato qualche mese fa coordinatore del partito, per il momento continua a dire che la strada di Ap dovrebbe essere quella di andare da soli alle Politiche. Ma l'ex ministro sa bene che con il Rosatellum questo percorso è poco praticabile. E, infatti, c'è chi giura che in realtà ormai da tempo abbia stretto un accordo con Silvio Berlusconi per tornare nel centrodestra. E a quel punto l'implosione sara inevitabile: si tratta solo di capire se i filo governativi - due nomi tra tutti Fabrizio Cicchitto e Beatrice Lorenzin - se ne andranno di loro spontanea volontà o se saranno accompagnati alla porta.

Né sarebbe un problema il veto che da tempo il leader della Lega ha posto su un ritorno di Ap. Il modo per superare questa impasse sarebbe già pronto: ""sacrificare"" Angelino Alfano, non candidarlo, lasciarlo al suo destino, magari a cercare un ""salvacondotto"" con il Pd. L'esperienza lombarda del governo Maroni che tiene tutti assieme aiuterebbe.

“We found it very humorous and a little excited that we would have a baby delivered by The Joker,” Justin Selph told People.
“But I told him, if he came back in it, it’s OK. That’d be a pretty cool story to tell,” Brittany Selph told ABC News.

A doctor dressed like The Joker delivered the baby girl at a Tennessee hospital last week after the mom unexpectedly went into labor on Halloween.

“My actual due date was not until today, but Tuesday morning I woke up and I felt like my water was leaking,” mom Brittany Selph told ABC News on Sunday.

Selph said she and her husband, Justin, sent their two children, ages 10 and 4, to school and then went to Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn.

That’s where they met up with their doctor, obstetrician Paul Locus, who came in dressed like the Batman villain played by the late actor Heath Ledger, complete with greasy green hair and a painted red mouth.

For the parents, his costume couldn’t have been cooler.

“We found it very humorous and a little excited that we would have a baby delivered by The Joker,” Justin Selph told People.

Since the couple still had a few more hours before their baby would arrive, Dr. Locus told them he’d pass out Halloween candy for a bit at home, and would return in his regular clothes and no makeup later.

“But I told him, if he came back in it, it’s OK. That’d be a pretty cool story to tell,” Brittany Selph told ABC News.

Sure enough, when Dr. Locus returned to deliver their baby, he remained disguised as The Joker and performed the delivery in his impeccable costume.

For Justin Selph, who snapped photos of the delivery, the doctor’s costume added another layer of excitement to the whole experience.

“There my wife is, staring the Joker straight in the eyes while delivering our baby, what a sight!” Justin Selph told People. “He was a great sport about the whole situation, and took photos with our family.”

The day after the delivery, Dr. Locus checked in on the couple and continued to play along with the Halloween gag, telling them, “‘Sorry I couldn’t make it in last night, glad to see the delivery went well!’” Justin Selph recalled to ABC News. “He also gave her a card of congratulations, and he signed it, ‘Dr. Joker.’”

According to the hospital, it was in true character for Dr. Locus to go above and beyond for his patients.

“Dr. Locus has mentioned he has been dressing up for his patients for as many years as he has been practicing,” Rhonda Crossett, director of HCMC’s Women’s Center, said in a statement emailed to HuffPost on Monday. “He loves going the extra mile to give them a unique and enjoyable delivery experience.”

He then noted President Donald Trump’s response to the terrorist attack in New York City last week, in which Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, allegedly killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a bike path. After that attack, for which the self-described Islamic State claimed responsibility, Trump decried terrorism, renewed discussion about the death penalty, called for radical vetting of immigrants and attacked political opponents and America’s judiciary.

Responding to the Texas massacre while visiting Japan, Trump said, “This isn’t a guns situation. ... This is a mental health problem at the highest level.”

Im Video oben: Martin reicht der Frau, von der er sich trennen will, ein Mikrofon mit einer unsensiblen Tonaufnahme

Und Kandidat Kevin schenkt Teilnehmerin Nadine statt einer Rose einen Hundeknochen

Die Macher der RTL-Kuppelsendung ""Schwiegertochter gesucht"" laufen in der diesjährigen Staffel wieder zur Höchstform der Menschenverachtung auf. Nachdem sie bereits erfolgreich die minderjährige Teilnehmerin Tutti bloßgestellt haben, ist in der aktuellen Folge Kandidatin Petra dran.

Petra hatte sich neben Catrin für das Wolfgang-Petry-Double Martin beworben. Schon in der Busfahrt zum Haus des Hobby-Sängers und seiner Mutter wurden die beiden mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik beschallt. Die Musik begleitete die Kandidaten von da an jeden Tag im Haus des selbsternannten Doubles.

Da ist es natürlich nur konsequent, dass die Kandidatinnen auch mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik verabschiedet werden. Denn RTL hat sich die wohl geschmackloseste Möglichkeit einfallen lassen, Kandidatin Petra nach Hause zu schicken.

Martin nimmt eine Sprachnachricht der besonderen Art auf

Martin überreichte jeder der Kandidatinnen ein Mikrofon mit einer selbst vertonten Aufnahme. Auf dem ersten Mikrofon sang er in wunderbar schiefer Tonlage: ""Ich habe Sehnsucht nach dir"", auf dem zweiten wiederum: ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"".

Das zweite Mikrofon überreichte er dann in einer Abschieds-Zeremonie der schwer verliebten Kandidatin Petra. Als diese auf den Knopf drückte und Martin fröhlich sang ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"" kamen ihr die Tränen.

Wenn dein Date dir nach dem ersten Treffen per Sprachnachricht nen Korb gibt. #schwiegertochtergesucht pic.twitter.com/0rSP86uzeg — Pascal (@pastables) 5. November 2017

Damit ist es RTL wieder einmal gelungen, eine Kandidatin zum Weinen zu bringen. Denn dass Martin selbst sich diese Idee hat einfallen lassen, ist höchst zweifelhaft.

Als Wiedergutmachung hat sich das RTL-Team dafür etwas ganz besonders Romantisches für Kandidatin Nadine einfallen lassen. ""Ich dachte, ich mache es heute mal so wie der Bachelor"", sagte Kevin zu seiner Auserwählten. Nur leider hatte Kevin keine Rose parat. Also reichte er Nadine ganz einfach einen Knochen. Einen Knochen, an dem normalerweise seine Hunde kauen.

Nadine war gerührt und willigte gleich darauf ein, die Nacht mit Kevin im Zelt zu verbringen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Verdacht: RTL hat einen perfiden Plan für die minderjährige Tutti bei ""Schwiegertochter gesucht""

Wer hätte auch widerstehen können, bei Kevins gekonntem Flirt-Spruch: ""Deine Augen gefallen mir, deine Nase auch, ich würde gerne eine Beziehung mit dir versuchen und später dann zusammen ziehen.""

Das kann man auch gleich beim ersten Date mal so klarstellen. Anschließend werden die beiden in einem Zelt schlafen, das so klein ist, dass Kevins Füße hinten rausschauen. Aber es ist bestimmt nicht die Absicht von RTL, sich über die Größe des Zweimeter-Mannes lustig zu machen. Alles purer Zufall, ganz bestimmt.

Nous verrons si, en appel, la Cour d'assise spéciale suivra l'avocat général qui demandait la perpétuité sur la complicité d'assassinat.","En novembre 2009, le tribunal de grande instance de Toulouse relaxait le directeur de l'usine AZF et la société propriétaire Grande Paroisse de l'infraction d'homicide involontaire faute de preuves suffisantes et au bénéfice du doute. Le tribunal a eu le cran d'écrire dans son jugement une formule qui résume bien notre système judiciaire et ses valeurs démocratiques : ""Le droit pénal est un droit d'application stricte. Et ceci est un des piliers de notre démocratie."" En ajoutant qu'il n'était pas possible de condamner sans preuves.

Et pourtant l'émotion avait été considérable puisque cette catastrophe, la plus grande d'après-guerre, avait fait trente et une victimes et des dégâts considérables, et le règlement aux victimes de 2,3 milliards d'euros d'indemnités par la société exploitante recapitalisée par Total. Huit ans plus tard, les crimes de complicité d'assassinat n'ont pas été retenus contre Abdelkader Merah au motif que ""les charges existant contre l'accusé étaient insuffisantes"", et le jugement a repris comme le tribunal de Toulouse le principe selon lequel le doute devait lui profiter.

L'avant-veille de cette décision de la cour d'assises spéciale, au terme de quatre mois d'audiences, le 31 octobre, la cour d'appel de Paris renversait le jugement du tribunal de Toulouse, dans AZF au terme d'un arrêt ne laissant place à aucun doute, en ne faisant état que de certitudes sans qu'aucun élément nouveau ne soit apparu depuis le jugement du tribunal huit ans plus tôt.

Que fera la cour d'assises d'appel dans l'affaire Merah? Peut-être la même chose, peut-être pas. Que fera la Cour de cassation dans l'affaire AZF? Cassera-t-elle une deuxième fois?

Le signataire de ces lignes est l'un des défenseurs du directeur de l'usine AZF et de la société Grande Paroisse ce qui, selon certains, peut être source de partialité. Mais la question est celle de l'application des principes à tous. Avec ou sans partialité cela revient au même.

Le vrai problème de la justice est le suivant: à quoi sert-elle? Une fois débarrassée des conceptions d'origine religieuses et monarchiques visant à établir sur terre un ordre divin représenté par le monarque, la démocratie apporte une réponse plus simple et terre à terre: la justice sert à assurer la paix civile. Elle est là pour éviter que les citoyens s'étripent dans les conflits privés et faire constater que ceux qui enfreignent le pacte social par des crimes ou des délits sont sanctionnés. C'est ainsi que lorsque l'émotion a été très grande du fait d'une énorme tragédie, comme dans l'affaire AZF, ou de crimes abominables, y compris sur des jeunes enfants, comme dans l'affaire Merah, les citoyens attendent de la justice qu'elle passe.

La facilité pour elle consiste à suivre la vague émotionnelle et à condamner en donnant satisfaction aux victimes, avec une peine maximale implacable, parce que c'est la plus simple façon d'assurer l'ordre public. La tentation est extrême pour les juges de satisfaire l'opinion et de décider ce qu'elle attend. Ainsi, le peuple des victimes d'AZF souhaitait une condamnation et, après de multiples retournements, a fini par l'obtenir au bout de seize ans.

Les victimes des abominables crimes de Mohamed Merah souhaitaient voir condamner son frère Abdelkader à la peine maximum pour complicité d'assassinat. La cour d'assises spéciale a pourtant décidé de l'acquitter sur cette charge, malgré une peine de vingt ans pour association de malfaiteurs qui se justifie en droit, bien que ce texte soit discuté depuis plus de cent ans.

La paix civile peut être satisfaite par une condamnation allant dans le sens de l'opinion mais éventuellement contraire à l'ordre public par ses effets secondaires. En effet, lorsque la justice condamne par facilité, et disons-le franchement par ""démagogie"", elle distribue une sorte de drogue dangereuse pour la paix civile. Car si les principes démocratiques qui fondent notre justice ne sont pas respectés, à savoir qu'on ne peut pas condamner des gens lorsqu'on n'a pas de preuve, la drogue attaque la justice en son cœur car elle n'est alors plus crédible à long terme. Une infection mortelle.

Or la paix civile est assurée parce que les juges sont là pour dire que, quelles que soient les circonstances, la règle est la même pour tous : pas de preuve, pas de condamnation. Si elle enfreint une fois cette règle, elle perd sa crédibilité pour la suite et, après avoir cédé à la facilité, elle rencontre la difficulté. C'est pour cela que le métier de juge est difficile. Il est même héroïque. Il consiste souvent à aller contre l'opinion publique lorsque c'est nécessaire, sans rétribution ni félicitations, mais simplement pour conserver l'honneur et l'estime de soi.

Nous verrons dans l'affaire AZF si la Cour de cassation qui est saisie acceptera l'arrêt de la cour d'appel de Paris qui contredit le tribunal de Toulouse et les principes qu'il a rappelés. Nous verrons si, en appel, la Cour d'assise spéciale suivra l'avocat général qui demandait la perpétuité sur la complicité d'assassinat. Ce sont des débats qui engagent l'avenir d'une société. Il est bon de le rappeler et de ne pas réduire le sujet à la critique personnelle des juges qui décident et des modestes avocats qui ne sont que les auxiliaires de justice et auxquels le public s'en prend plus volontiers qu'aux juges parce qu'il en a moins peur.

The new jobs will include tech and non-tech jobs, such as software development, human resources and marketing roles.

While Dougherty expressed excitement about Amazon's quick growth in his hometown, he remained mum on the possibility the company may choose Vancouver as the site for its planned second headquarters, dubbed HQ2.

""I have no information on HQ2,"" he later told the media.

An Amazon spokesperson added the announcement is separate from the second headquarters plans and there's no connection between the two.

B.C. Premier called it 'great day'

Still, local leaders hailed the news as a possible leg-up for Metro Vancouver's bid.

B.C. Premier John Horgan called it ""a great day"" for the tech sector.

""I believe it's an opportunity for us to look forward again to other challenges and other opportunities presented by Amazon,"" he said at the event.

Metro Vancouver and Langford, B.C., have submitted bids for Amazon's new headquarters.

The premier touted the province's post-secondary institutions and diversity as a big draw.

We are thrilled to be an important city on Amazon's world map and even more so going forward. Mayor Gregor Robertson

Mayor Gregor Robertson also hinted at an expanding relationship with the tech firm.

""We are thrilled to be an important city on Amazon's world map and even more so going forward,"" he said.

Robertson later told the media every job Amazon creates in Vancouver boosts its chances of future growth and the city's strong partnership with the company is an advantage.

""Many other cities competing don't have any Amazon jobs, and we now have thousands,"" he said.

Robertson acknowledged absorbing the company's second headquarters _ along with up to 50,000 new, high-paying jobs it promises — could be challenging, but noted the US$5-billion investment would come in phases spread out over several years giving the winning city time to prepare adequately.

Vancouver would have to continue to increase its housing supply, invest in its transit system and boost its education system, particularly the number of STEM graduates, he said.

Amazon said earlier this month it received 238 proposals from North American cities and regions.

In addition to the two B.C. hopefuls, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax, Calgary and several others submitted proposals earlier this month.

Instead, the deputy president opted for science and technology minister Naledi Pandor as his running mate ahead of the ANC's national conference in December.

Mabuza is said to have a firm grip on most of the 736 voting delegates from his province who will be attending the conference. This makes Mpumalanga the second-biggest voting bloc behind KwaZulu-Natal, and makes Mabuza a kingmaker, or queenmaker, come December.

Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma took heed of this months ago, naming Mabuza deputy president on her slate.

Analysts say although Pandor may have been the better option for Ramaphosa come 2019 -- when the ANC will seek to present a credible leadership in efforts to woo back voters to the party during the national elections -- not offering Mabuza a top spot may cost Ramaphosa his hopes at winning over the ANC in December.

He is not convinced that Mabuza would want to be on Ramaphosa's slate -- even if an offer was made, said commented political analyst Ralph Mathekga.

""[Pandor] has stayed away from the factions and comes with a great deal of credibility. It represents a great winning team for 2019. But is it strategic for now? I don't think so,"" Mathekga said.

""If Ramaphosa gave Mabuza an obscure position in the top six, [Ramaphosa] couldn't say he was fighting corruption while holding Mabuza's hand.""

Mabuza is shrouded in a host of controversies. In 2010, a alleged sum of R14-million in cash was stolen from his house. But the province's organised-crime unit insisted only R1,200 was stolen -- possibly to avoid drawing too much attention to Mabuza.

He has also been accused of being behind several political killings in Mpumalanga.

Mabuza has a serious bargaining chip, said the University of the Witwatersrand's Susan Booysen.

""Mabuza has the political power to force his way to the top; Pandor is not politically ambitious. There is a graphic contrast between the two. So much kingmaking power also comes with so much baggage,"" Booysen said.

Ramaphosa's best political move would have been to take on Mabuza as his deputy, said the University of Johannesburg's Mzukisi Qobo.

""The main consideration for now should be to win 2017. But one has to balance principle and pragmatism in politics, and Ramaphosa veered to the side of principle [in choosing Pandor]. It's a big gamble,"" Qobo said.

However, political analyst Keith Gottschalk said there is still time for changes to be made.

""Ramaphosa can still continue negotiations with Mabuza. Perhaps he may offer him a state post come 2019. At least in this way, Ramaphosa did not have to submit to the take-it-or-leave-it option that Mabuza is offering. Slates are not contracts. Ramaphosa is not obligated to keep to it,"" Gottschalk said.

But Mabuza is still playing his cards close to his chest, as he has not revealed whom he is backing in the presidential race. Despite recent talk of unity, it still remains unclear how he will persuade his branches to vote.

Ramaphosa is clearly looking ahead to 2019, trying to provide the most credible leadership in the hopes of holding on to the reins should he become ANC president. But to do that, he has to be voted into the top spot first.

Mabuza will play a key part in making this happen -- for any candidate. Perhaps Ramaphosa knows something the rest of the country doesn't, or perhaps he feels like he has enough to secure the win without the Mpumalanga boss's help.

However, gender equality does appear to promote better economic performance, according to numerous studies.

Despair shouldn’t be the main takeaway from the index, WEF insisted.","Women will have to wait more than two centuries ― 217 years ― to have the same job and wage opportunities as men around the world, new data suggests.

The annual Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum, published Thursday, makes for more bleak reading to accompany the sexual abuse and harassment scandals plaguing numerous industries and governments.

The survey of 144 countries finds that as a whole, gender equality has worsened globally for the first time since WEF first produced its index in 2006. While income levels are rising, women are not sharing equally in the benefits, even in the most affluent countries.

“There seems to be a slowdown in momentum when it comes to proactive measures being taken to address gender gaps, particularly in the workplace,” said Vesselina Stefanova Ratcheva, an economist at WEF.

The index measures how opportunities and participation differ for men and women across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The most challenging gaps are in economy and politics, according to the report.

The U.S. saw its ranking drop from 45th last year to 49th this year, mostly due to a lack of women in U.S. politics. Men hold nearly 81 percent of the seats in Congress and make up the majority of mayors and governors.

The top 10 countries for gender equality are predominantly European, with four northern European nations in the top five. Iceland is in the top position for the ninth year in a row, followed by Norway and Finland.

World Economic Forum

But it’s not just European countries that scored highly; the top 10 also included Rwanda and Nicaragua. These economies are “putting in place more gender-equal opportunities regardless of their level of economic development,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

None of the big powerhouse economies of the G-20 made it into the top 10, “showing that economic power is not necessarily a recipe for better equality between the sexes,” according to WEF.

However, gender equality does appear to promote better economic performance, according to numerous studies. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis estimated that more equality between the sexes would boost the global economy by $28 trillion. For the U.S. in particular, the WEF index cites a study that economic parity could add $1.7 trillion to the country’s GDP.

Despair shouldn’t be the main takeaway from the index, WEF insisted. “It is important to note that while the global picture is bleak in 2017, there have been some clear signs of progress in the past decade,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

The gender gap in education could be closed within the next 13 years, says WEF. And there are some standout countries that have made rapid improvements ― including Canada, which climbed 19 places for women’s progress in politics and wages.

“What is needed is new energy and commitment at the leader level ― in business as well as political leadership ― to put these into effect,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

Certain.es ont décidé de constituer un collectif Archives LGBTQI au début du mois de septembre 2017.

Nous revendiquons l'idée qu'un centre d'archives, d'exposition, de recherche, de documentation et de mémoire est non seulement indispensable, mais surtout qu'il est possible, et dès 2018. Nous n'attendrons pas plus longtemps!

Parce que bâtir un tel lieu d'archivage et de documentation sur l'histoire des LGBTQI, sur leurs mouvements d'émancipation comme sur leurs vies individuelles, est une ""urgence déjà ancienne"".

Parce que la mémoire des LGBTQI se meurt en silence. La génération qui a mené les luttes des années 1970-90, quand elle n'est pas disparue - notamment décimée par l'épidémie de sida, est vieillissante, parfois précaire, isolée ou malade. Le Centre d'archives doit donc commencer par l'urgent, par les paroles perdues, par les supports fragiles, par ce qui disparaît.

Parce que le récent succès du film 120 battements par minute n'a pas créé cette urgence, mais l'a révélée au grand public. Il a aussi amené beaucoup de jeunes, LGBTQI mais pas seulement, à s'intéresser comme jamais auparavant à ces histoires, ces mémoires, ces cultures, ces fiertés.

Parce que dans une logique participative et militante, les LGBTQI ont toute légitimité pour faire entendre leur voix dans le débat public sur les archives et faire bénéficier des solutions concrètes élaborées au sein de nos communautés.

Enfin, parce que notre calendrier est entièrement indifférent aux enjeux électoraux. Nous refusons donc de rendre la date d'ouverture du Centre prisonnière du rythme de la réforme administrative de Paris.

Nous proposons douze priorités concrètes, pour construire dès 2018 le futur Centre d'archives LGBTQI, permettant son lancement rapide, sans transiger sur son ambition ni ses missions:

1. Elaborer, entreprendre et coordonner la collecte de la mémoire orale des LGBTQI, et appuyer les initiatives en ce sens à travers le pays.

2. Amplifier et coordonner dès maintenant, dans tout le pays, l'information sur les possibilités de dépôt et de don déjà offertes par le Centre d'archives. Un box d'urgence existe, encore faut-il l'utiliser.

3. Conserver et recueillir à la fois des archives au sens strict et toute la variété des objets significatifs des histoires LGBTQI dans leur diversité, y compris l'histoire des LGBTQI-phobies. Seules certaines archives LGBTQI sont aujourd'hui jugées dignes de conservation dans les fonds publics. Pour nous, le champ des mémoires à conserver est plus large, il inclut les archives associatives et individuelles y compris d'""anonymes"", des personnes invisibilisé.es (personnes racisées, étrangères, précaires) ou encore d'entreprises ou de commerces.

4. Rassembler sur un seul lieu, le stockage d'archives, une salle de lecture, un lieu de recherche pluridisciplinaire, un espace d'expositions et de débats, ouvert aux chercheurs.ses comme au grand public. Alimenter un réseau de ressources disponibles partout en France. Le Centre doit être un véritable réseau, qui croise les fonctions et favorise les échanges.

5. Classer, référencer, indexer et numériser l'ensemble des fonds accueillis dans le Centre d'archives, sur la base d'un thésaurus francophone pour permettre le référencement d'archives LGBTQI. Epauler les démarches similaires pour les fonds LGBTQI en régions.

6. Etablir et publier début 2018 un guide des sources conservées dans les institutions publiques, et, dans une démarche active de collecte, solliciter les détenteurs.trices de fonds susceptibles de rejoindre le Centre.

7. Définir une politique culturelle et scientifique autour des LGBTQI et de leur diversité. ""Déplacardiser"" les archives passe par la création de ce lieu nouveau, même si les institutions publiques du patrimoine ont récemment évolué sur ce point.

8. Créer une association loi de 1901 ""type"", associant personnes morales et physiques intéressées pour gérer le Centre. Ce modèle, retenu par les centres d'archives à Amsterdam, Berlin ou San Francisco, permet de créer un ""tiers de confiance"" pour les LGBTQI, qui ne peut être l'émanation d'une institution publique. Il sera ainsi une tête de réseau au plan national pour les diverses initiatives, garantira l'apport du bénévolat et permettra que les fonds ne soient pas divisés lors de leur dépôt.

9. Permettre au Centre, en rythme de croisière, de disposer d'une équipe salariée d'au moins 5 personnes, d'au minimum 750 m², des moyens techniques et financiers adéquats pour mener les missions déjà détaillées. Là encore, ces ordres de grandeur sont ceux des centres / musées qui existent depuis longtemps ailleurs qu'en France. Au regard de ses défis comme de l'expérience accumulée dans d'autres pays, le centre va croître progressivement.

10. Mettre en place des conventions pluriannuelles d'objectifs avec l'Etat et les collectivités locales, des conventions de partenariats avec les institutions publiques du patrimoine, et lancer des projets avec l'Europe, tant en matière de lutte contre les discriminations que pour accompagner le projet culturel et de recherche du Centre.

11. Définir un programme de formations et de coopération avec le monde éducatif ainsi qu'avec des partenaires culturels (cinémas, festivals...).

12. Fixer au premier semestre 2018, sur la base d'une large consultation, le nom du Centre. Oui, les LGBTQI ont aussi des idées pour le nom du futur lieu, et oui, elles et ils sont au moins aussi légitimes que quiconque pour faire des propositions.

Cette ""maison commune"" doit, à chaque étape, refuser toute velléité jacobine et appuyer ce qui se fait déjà ou peut se faire ailleurs qu'à Paris.

Nous voulons un Centre d'archives, un lieu d'exposition et de mémoire, et nous le voulons dès 2018. Le colloque de réflexion tel qu'il est évoqué par la Ville de Paris pour 2018, nous semble un détour, sinon une diversion...

Avec ces douze priorités, nous démontrons que l'obstacle n'est pas, aujourd'hui, du côté des LGBTQI, ou du fait d'incompréhensions avec les futurs partenaires publics et scientifiques.

A tous.tes, nous disons: il est temps !

Emily Eekhoff bemerkte, dass sich ihr ungeborenes Baby plötzlich anders in ihrem Bauch bewegt

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Von Jenna B.

Ihr wisst sicher einiges über Depressionen.

Ihr wisst, dass Menschen mit Depressionen sich oft traurig und leer fühlen, keinen Appetit haben oder schlecht schlafen können. Dass sie müde sind und dass ihnen Dinge keine Freude mehr bereiten, die sie normalerweise lieben würden. Und dass sie vielleicht sogar an den Tod und ans Sterben denken.

Doch ein Symptom von Depressionen, von dem ihr wahrscheinlich noch nicht gehört habt und gleichzeitig eines, das mit am schwersten zu ertragen ist: Einsamkeit.

Wir Menschen sehnen uns nach Nähe. Sogar die meisten Introvertierten wollen mit kleinen Gruppen oder einzelnen Personen in Interaktion treten.

Doch wenn ich mich depressiv fühle, kann ich mich selbst nicht dazu bringen, Verabredungen auszumachen oder einzuhalten. Manchmal kann ich nicht mal duschen und mich anziehen, geschweige denn das Haus verlassen.

Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut

Doch das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Gesellschaft möchte. Im Gegenteil: Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut. Doch ich habe Angst, jemanden zu fragen.

Ich weiß, dass ich andere damit belaste. Und ich weiß auch, dass es keinen Spaß macht, mit mir Zeit zu verbringen, weil ich immer traurig bin und es mir schwer fällt, die Dinge zu genießen, die ich früher gerne mochte.

Ich fühle mich schuldig, dass ich diese Gesellschaft möchte, dass ich jemanden in meiner Nähe brauche.

Wenn ich mich sehr schlimm niedergeschlagen fühle, sehne ich mich nach jemanden, mit dem ich sprechen kann und der mich versteht, ohne mich zu verurteilen. Doch ich bekomme meinen Mund nicht auf, um nach der Hilfe zu fragen, die ich brauche.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt

Ich bin gefangen in meinem eigenen Kopf und ich kann mich innerlich schreien hören. Doch leider kann niemand meine Gedanken lesen.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt und desto weniger Kraft habe ich, mit anderen Menschen in Kontakt zu treten. Doch das ist genau der Zeitpunkt, an dem ich am meisten auf jemanden angewiesen bin, der sieht, was mit mir los ist.

Es ist traurig, dass die Symptome von Depressionen dafür sorgen, dass du so viele Freunde verlierst. Wegen des Stigmas, das der Krankheit anhaftet, oder weil sie nicht verstehen oder Angst haben oder nicht wissen, wie sie helfen sollen. Oder weil sie beschäftigt sind und nicht gestört werden wollen.

Denn manchmal ist der beste Weg, einem Freund oder geliebten Person mit Depressionen zu begegnen, einfach Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen und zu tun, wonach ihm ist.

Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen

Auch wenn das nur ein Netflix-Abend auf der Couch ist oder ein gemeinsamer Kaffee oder ein Abendessen. Allein dadurch, dass du dich um deinen Freund oder deine Freundin kümmerst, hilft ihm oder ihr, sich besser zu fühlen.

Sogar wenn der Andere deine Worte der Beschwichtigung und des Trostes nicht zu hören scheint, kann deine Anwesenheit sehr wertvoll für ihn sein. Es tut immer gut zu wissen, dass jemand sich um dich sorgt und aufrichtige, liebevolle Worte zu hören.

Mir hilft das immer sehr, wenn ich depressiv bin. Es erinnert mich daran, dass ich diese Liebe verdient habe und hilft mir, an meiner Selbstliebe zu arbeiten, die mich aus der Depression herausziehen kann.

Wenn ihr also einen Freund oder Liebsten habt, der unter Depressionen leidet, erinnert euch bitte immer daran: Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen. Depressionen sind eine Krankheit, die sehr einsam macht. Und Nähe zu anderen Menschen ist extrem wichtig bei der Genesung.

Je me permets d'abord de te dire ""tu"", j'espère que ça ne te dérange pas. Je t'ai regardée et écoutée, hier dans 7 à 8 sur TF1, et je regarderai ce soir le téléfilm Mention particulière dans lequel tu joues le rôle d'une jeune fille trisomique qui passe son bac.

Ma fille est petite, elle n'a pas encore trois ans mais elle a comme toi un chromosome supplémentaire qui la rend un peu ""escargot"", comme tu l'as raconté.

Marie, je voulais te dire merci, parce que dans ton interview, tu as dit devant des millions de téléspectateurs des choses très importantes. En temps normal, les personnes avec trisomie 21 ou leurs familles n'ont pas l'occasion de dire tout cela. Les personnes ""ordinaires"" n'ont pas forcément envie de les écouter...

Tu parles de sujets très durs avec ton grand sourire, tu expliques que tu as compris très vite que tu étais trisomique et que ça a été dur. Tu racontes aussi comment le théâtre t'a aidé à être plus forte que les moqueries et que ton handicap, tu expliques que tes parents ont toujours voulu au maximum que tu fasses ""comme les autres""...

Même si c'était si difficile pour toi de faire tes lacets au lieu de mettre des scratchs, même si on t'appelait ""l'escargot"" à cause de ça. Moi, ça me fait pleurer, mais toi tu ris et tu dis que maintenant ça n'est plus ""important"", tu souris encore et tu leur dis à tous qu'au final, demain c'est toi qui passe dans un film à la télé sur TF1.

Tu vois Marie, tu m'as donné un bon petit coup de pied au cul. Je ne sais pas si ma fille aimera le théâtre, si elle pourra parler aussi bien que toi, ni ce qu'elle aura envie de faire, mais tu m'as rappelé qu'il ne faudra jamais, jamais que j'écoute les autres ou mon découragement.

Tu sais Marie, il y a quelques jours je pensais à tout ce que nous devons faire de compliqué pour que Louise entre à l'école ""comme les autres"" dans quelques mois. J'y pensais, et ça me semblait si difficile, effrayant et compliqué que je me suis dit ""En fait je ne sais plus si je veux qu'elle aille à l'école, c'est trop dur, je n'y arriverai jamais"".

Merci Marie de m'avoir rappelé que ça n'est pas parce que c'est dur qu'on doit abandonner. Tu as appris à lacer tes chaussures, et pourtant c'était dur. Tu as fait ton chemin dans la vie en sachant que tu n'étais pas ""comme les autres"", c était dur. Tes parents t'ont poussée à faire ce qui te rendait heureuse, ils n'ont sûrement pas écouté quand on leur disait que tu n'y arriverais pas ou que ce serait trop difficile pour toi.

Mais aujourd'hui tu souris, tu es heureuse et fière de toi - tes soeurs et tes parents le sont aussi, tu l'as dit. Et nous aussi Marie, on est très fiers de toi, nous les familles de personnes trisomiques. Ce soir, je te regarderai, comme plein de personnes que je connais, et je pleurerai et sourirai devant ce film, c'est certain. Je guetterai aussi les réactions des gens qu'on dit ""ordinaires"", car il y en aura! Si leurs commentaires ne me plaisent pas, je penserai à toi et à ta force. Si leurs réactions sont positives et aident à changer les regards sur la trisomie en France, je te dirai à nouveau: merci, merci, merci :-)

Drum prüfe, wer sich ewig bindet... Das gilt für dieses Paar im Besonderen, denn die beiden sind seit November 2007 ein Paar. Schon lange zehn Jahre hält diese Liebe also. Im Dezember 2011 verlobten sich Annemarie Warnkross, wie sie damals noch hieß, und der Sohn des südafrikanischen Schlagerstars Howard Carpendale (71). Ihre persönliche Traumhochzeit feierten sie dann im September 2013 auf Ibiza.

Warnkross und Carpendale Junior waren aber auch zuvor schon jeweils mit prominenten Partnern zusammen. Während die gebürtige Hannoveranerin von 2002 bis 2004 mit Comedian Oliver Pocher (39) liiert war, schaffte es der in NRW geborene Künstler immerhin auf eine dreijährige Beziehung mit Kollegin Yvonne Catterfeld (37).

Auch beruflich zusammengewachsen

Auch beruflich ist das Traumpaar inzwischen zusammengewachsen. Seit 2016 moderieren Annemarie und Wayne Carpendale gemeinsam ""Ran an den Mann"" (Sat.1). Zuvor spielte er vor allem in Serien, Reihen und Soaps wie ""Unter uns"" (2000-2001), ""Unser Charly"" (2005-2007), "" Sturm der Liebe"" (2006-2008), ""Der Landarzt"" (2009-2013), ""Mord in bester Gesellschaft"" (2013-2015) oder ""Heldt"" (2015-2016).

Die öffentliche Karriere von Annemarie Warnkross begann als Tänzerin von Bellini (""Brazil""). Von 2000 bis 2005 war sie Mitglied der Pop-Gruppe. Danach konzentrierte sie sich auf Moderation, Modeln und das Studium. Seit 2005 führt sie durch die Magazine ""taff"" und ""red!"" - kurz vor der Sendung zeigt sie ihren Fans regelmäßig, welches sexy Outfit sie diesmal wieder tragen wird.

Trauen Sie sich also, Ihrem Kind gegenüber Chef zu sein. Das hat nichts mit mangelndem Respekt Ihrem Kind gegenüber zu tun. Sie als Eltern haben nun mal die Richtlinien der Erziehung in der Hand.

This is the goal of the act, to foster adherence to state religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for requests for accommodations on religious grounds in certain bodies, recently given assent in Québec. Some people find that the act goes too far, others that it does not go far enough. The Québec government's legislation aims to strike a balance.

Firstly, the act affirms the religious neutrality of the state.

Secondly, it codifies the principles governing reasonable accommodation, as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada, while adding the criterion of equality between men and women and emphasizing the need for collaboration in the search for a reasonable accommodation.

Lastly, the act promotes inclusion by requiring people to uncover their faces during the interaction involved in the delivery of a public service. This is based on the objectives of security, identification and quality communications. The requirement applies only when there is an interaction with a state employee. For example, people required to uncover their faces when interacting with the bus driver as they board, can then cover their face again, except if the context requires further interaction and if one of the three objectives applies. The goal is not to ban religious symbols. The act promotes the goal of living together in harmony while respecting the rights guaranteed by the Charters.

For a large majority of Quebecers, this progressiveness goes hand-in-hand with high-quality interrelations between individuals, promoting inclusion rather than isolation and withdrawal.

Québec society is not an exception. The European Court of Human Rights ruled, on the basis of social cohesion that the kind of prohibition introduced by this act is not unreasonable in a society aiming to preserve ""the conditions of ""'living together.'"" As recently pointed out by Margaret Wente in the Globe and Mail and Barbara Kay, many free and democratic states such as Norway, Belgium, France, Germany and Australia have enacted similar legislation.

Furthermore, if the debate triggered by Québec's act appears to put Québec's political class in opposition to the rest of Canada, the results of a recent Ipsos Public Affairs survey show that Canadian citizens are far less divided on the question than could be expected. While 76 per cent of respondents in Québec stated their support for this legislation, a majority, or 68 per cent, of respondents in the rest of Canada said they would support the application of a similar law in their own province.

Québec is a plural, open and tolerant nation. For Quebecers, respect for human rights is paramount, as it has often introduced programs and legislation that reflect the eminently progressive nature of Québec society. For a large majority of Quebecers, this progressiveness goes hand-in-hand with high-quality interrelations between individuals, promoting inclusion rather than isolation and withdrawal. The Quebec law is part of this process, and ensures that people will be able to live harmoniously together with respect for all individuals.

Your body processes calories from certain foods differently, depending on whether or not the food (and its ingredients) are nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor. Kelly Hogan, a clinical nutrition and wellness manager at Mount Sinai’s Dubin Breast Cancer center, helped explain why certain foods, such as kale, are processed differently in our bodies than a food like sugary cereal. She said it’s important to focus on the nutrient density of foods.

“A [100-calorie] bowl of kale with an egg is going to give you high quality protein, fiber and a big variety of vitamins and minerals like vitamins, A, C, K, folate, etc,” Hogan said. “A [100-calorie bowl of] cereal that is high in sugar is not going to give you the same quality nutrients. And what’s more, the fact that it is low in protein and fiber but high in sugar can set you up for a blood sugar spike and crash, bringing on more cravings for sweets or refined starches throughout the day.

She added, “It’s easy to overeat when eating these types of food because of these blood sugar fluctuations and the fact that they aren’t typically super filling.”

You can tell you’re having a blood sugar crash if you start to experience irritability, dizziness, weakness or an intense feeling of hunger, Hogan said.

“This is where the term ‘hangry’ comes from as well ― when our blood sugar is low and we need to eat something, we often have difficulty concentrating, focusing and are more likely to snap at others,” she explained. “The body will physiologically crave something sweet or starchy when blood sugar is low because these are the foods that can raise blood sugar quickly.”

To prevent these type of crashes, try eating foods that are nutrient rich, like fruits, veggies, lean proteins, legumes, nuts, seeds, beans and dairy (the Center for Disease Control has a helpful graphic that offers nutrient-dense information for certain ingredients). Hogan likes to call these “whole foods” and you might know some of them by another term ― “complex carbohydrates.”

“Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates that take the body longer to break down into sugar because they have longer, more complex chemical structures compared to sugar,” she said. “They are a more sustainable energy source because of this and won’t raise blood sugar quite as quickly as more simple sugars.”

And no matter what, don’t assign foods labels like “good” or “bad.”

“Giving food labels like that fuels a diet culture and harmful relationship with food,” Hogan said. “In a diet with plenty of these whole foods, there is absolutely room for less nutrient dense but also delicious foods, like cake, for example.”",How Your Body Knows The Difference Between 100 Calories Of Kale vs. Junk Food,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-your-body-processes-100-calories-of-cereal-differently-from-100-calories-of-kale_us_59fc8990e4b0b0c7fa39c362

Amy Allen, then 18, of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, was due to start her first year of a psychology degree at York St John’s University, when she saw her GP because her period had stopped. Not long after, she received the diagnosis. Now 21 and recently graduated, Amy said: “I was the first person in living memory in Yorkshire to be diagnosed with that type of ovarian tumour, a Sertoli-Leydig sex cord tumour. “I went to the hospital appointment alone and hearing the words, ‘It’s cancer’ was incredibly shocking.”

PA Real Life Features Amy Allen (right) pictured with a friend.

Initially, Amy, the eldest of four children, was wrongly suspected of suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as her symptoms were very similar. PCOS causes many small and harmless follicles to grow on the ovaries and has symptoms including irregular or no periods and excess body and facial hair. Recalling the moment her GP told her she needed further tests during freshers’ week, Amy said: “The doctor from home rang me to ensure I was getting checked out. My blood test results had revealed that my testosterone levels were 2.5 times higher than they should be, and my oestrogen levels were significantly lower.” Subsequent ultra-scan and MRI scans carried out at York Hospital in late 2014 indicated that Amy had a suspected cyst on her ovary. In March 2015, she had this biopsied, so it could be examined more closely. Amy continued: “Seven weeks had passed and I’d had my first period in a year and I thought everything was dandy. My periods had started at about 14, but after a few years they gave me very severe lower back pain and I developed bad facial hair. Then they stopped not long after I turned 18.” Contacted about a post-biopsy appointment, Amy went alone, believing everything was fine, only to be told she had cancer. She recalled: “The doctors and nurses were so nice. They explained everything and we had a laugh about the rarity and excitement of the type of tumour – the first one to be diagnosed in Yorkshire. “If I hadn’t laughed I would have cried.” But she saved her tears until she could call her housemates, when she sobbed down the phone. “Getting the diagnosis was the scariest day of my life and a memory that will stay with me for a while,” she admitted. “At 19 years old and coming towards the end of my first year of university, cancer was not something I thought I’d personally have to go through.”",Graduate Reveals How Missed Period And Facial Hair Turned Out To Be Signs Of Rare Cancer,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graduate-reveals-how-missed-period-turned-out-to-be-rare-ovarian-cancer_uk_5a003dcee4b0baea26331b28?k7f&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Emily Eekhoff bemerkte, dass sich ihr ungeborenes Baby plötzlich anders in ihrem Bauch bewegt

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Was das mit Kaffeekapseln zu tun hat, erklärt der Soziologe Stephan Lessenich

Es ist leicht, es ist bequem - und George Clooney macht es auch: der Kaffee aus der Kapsel.

20.600 Tonnen der Kapseln haben die Deutschen 2015 verbraucht. Zehn Jahre zuvor waren es gerade einmal 800 Tonnen. Ein sprunghafter Anstieg.

Dabei gelten die kleinen Kapseln schon länger als wahre Umweltsünder. Das Verhältnis von Inhalt zu Verpackung ist völlig unverhältnismäßig - und das Material, Aluminium, ist häufig umweltschädlich.

Das Ergebnis: 5000 Tonnen Abfall an Aluminium. Wem diese Zahl zu abstrakt ist, der kann sich auch dieses Foto ansehen. Es macht deutlich, welche Schäden ein scheinbar harmloser Genuss wie Kaffeetrinken anrichten kann:

Die Aufnahme zeigt das brasilianische Dorf Bento Rodrigues. Am 5. November 2015 kamen hier 19 Menschen ums Leben, sie wurden von einer Schlammlawine überrollt.

Und neben uns die Sintflut

Ursache war ein Dammbruch im Rückhaltebecken der Eisenerzmine Samarco in der brasilianischen Bergbaustadt Mariana. Durchsetzt mit Schwermetallen überzog eine giftige Schicht von Schlamm das Tal. Die Wasserversorgung für Millionen von Menschen ist seitdem gefährdet.

Schlamm und Tote hier, unschuldiger Kaffeekonsum dort - beides hänge zusammen, erklärt der Soziologe Stephan Lessenich in seinem Buch ""Neben uns die Sintflut"", über das er am Sonntag im Deutschlandfunk sprach.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wie ein Brasilianer seit 40 Jahren Baum für Baum den Regenwald rettet

Am Beispiel des Dammbruchs in Brasilien versucht Lessenich, die Zusammenhänge von Konsum und Ausbeutung der Natur verständlich zu machen.

Kaffeekonsum und die Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen

Für Lessenich dient Samarco als Beispiel für den Rohstoffhunger des Westens in Brasilien. Das Bergbauunternehmen Rio Tinto, das einen Anteil an der Mine hält, hat seine Eisenerzförderung zwischen 2006 und 2014 drastisch gesteigert. Sicherheitsmängel im Rückhaltebecken der Mine seien ignoriert worden, schreibt Lessenich in seinem Buch.

Rio Tinto steigerte auch seine Förderung von Bauxit drastisch. Dieses Erz wiederum dient der Herstellung von Aluminium. Und Aluminium steckt dann etwa auch in den kleinen, fein portionierten und leicht verwendbaren Kaffeekapseln, die in den vergangenen Jahre immer beliebter wurde.

""Da kann man sehen, dass es da bestimmte Verbindungen gibt"", sagte Lessenich im Deutschlandfunk. ""Also der lockerleichte, nebenher betriebene Kaffeekonsum hierzulande und die Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen von vielen, vielen Menschen anderswo in der Welt.""

In der Regel würden die Verbindungen nicht so klar hervortreten. Im Fall des Dammbruchs mit seinen 19 Toten aber bleibe die Verbindung von Rohstoffhunger und die “Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen” nicht verborgen. In der Tat: Sie ist auf den Fotos überdeutlich.

Mit dem Beispiel will Lessenich zeigen, wie sehr kleine Entscheidungen im Alltag größere Folgen nach sich ziehen können - und wie kompliziert das mit dem Konsum in einer modernen, globalisierten Welt geworden ist.

Wenn jede Entscheidung plötzlich zählt

""Konsum ist Politik mit dem Einkaufswagen"", kommentierte kürzlich die Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"" die Verwirrung, die verantwortungsvolle Käufer zwangsläufig überkommt. Wie wahr dieser Satz ist. Der Fortbestand des Regenwalds entscheidet sich eben auch an der heimischen Kaffeemaschine.

Jede Entscheidung will gut überlegt sein, jede Kaufentscheidung kann einen ganzen Rattenschwanz von Folgen mit sich bringen. Manchmal gute, manchmal schlechte, manchmal verheerende.

Im Falle der Kaffeekapseln gibt es allerdings auch mehrere mögliche Lösungen, um den Schaden für die Umwelt zu begrenzen. Man steigt um auf Filterkaffee - oder man gewöhnt sich einen Handgriff an: Man wirft die Kapseln zumindest in den gelben Sack. Nespresso etwa, der größte Hersteller von Kaffeekapseln, bemüht sich darum, das Recyceln so leicht wie möglich zu machen.

Wie viele Kaffeetrinker die Kapseln dort reinwerfen, weiß der Hersteller nicht. Es ist eine Entscheidung, die jedem selbst überlassen bleibt.

Aber auch eine, die Folgen am anderen Ende der Welt haben kann.

Empty calorie foods and drinks include: soft drinks, alcohol, energy drinks, cordial, some white breads, biscuits, sweets, pastries, ice cream, condiments, fatty processed meats and many deep-fried takeaway foods.
What's the opposite of empty calorie foods?
The foods we should replace empty calorie foods with include healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats such as avocado, nuts and seeds.
""When people count calories, they also often avoid foods that are nutrient dense and higher in calories (like those mentioned before -- fatty fish, nuts and so on) and replace them with lower calorie foods that have minimal nutritional benefit.""","When it comes to food and eating, we all have different approaches. There are some of us who see food just as delicious food, while others see it in terms of nutrition or even as energy (calories).

While it's important not to get too caught up in the amount of calories in food (because not all calories are created equal), knowing about empty calories is a helpful way to stay on track and keep your weight in check.

To understand more about empty calories and which foods and drinks they are found in, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

What is a calorie?

""A calorie is a unit of energy. It is the amount of energy or heat that is required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius,"" Rebecca Gawthorne, accredited practising dietitian and nutritionist, told HuffPost Australia. ""One calorie is equal to 4.18 kilojoules.

""In a food and nutrition context, a calorie is the unit of food energy. When people talk about the calories in food, they are referring to how much energy that food provides your body when you eat or drink it.""

What is an empty calorie?

""Empty calories refer to foods that are high in calories (that is, they are 'energy-dense') but are also 'nutrient-poor', meaning they are very low in essential nutrients and have little or no nutritional value,"" Gawthorne said.

""These are foods that are often heavily processed with many additives and we don't require them in our diets -- we can live without them.""

As nutritionist Steph Lowe of The Natural Nutritionist explained, ""an empty calorie refers to nutrient-poor foods and drinks that are usually full of added sugars and poor-quality fats"".

What are empty calorie foods? Empty calorie foods and drinks include: soft drinks, alcohol, energy drinks, cordial, some white breads, biscuits, sweets, pastries, ice cream, condiments, fatty processed meats and many deep-fried takeaway foods.

Do empty calories make you gain weight?

The short answer: yes.

""There is no health benefit to consuming foods that contain empty calories and they can actually have a negative impact on our health, leading to weight gain and chronic diseases, so it's best to limit or avoid empty calories,"" Gawthorne said.

""The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating recommends limiting discretionary foods, which would include empty calories, to only 'sometimes' and in small amounts. There is no specific calorie amount [to stay within] but it's best not to consume empty calories on a daily basis.""

But why exactly do these energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods cause weight gain? Lowe explained this is primarily due to the way refined sugars and poor-quality fats affect our body's processes.

""Refined sugar spikes the fat storage hormone insulin, and poor-quality fats impair mitochondrial function and contribute to inflammatory weight gain,"" Lowe told HuffPost Australia.

Alcohol is packed with energy (calories) but zero nutrition.

What's the opposite of empty calorie foods?

The foods we should replace empty calorie foods with include healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats such as avocado, nuts and seeds.

""Foods that are opposite to empty calories are those that are energy-dense (that is, they contain calories -- but remember calories aren't 'bad' or 'unhealthy' when accompanied by nutrients we need to live) and are high in essential nutrients,"" Gawthorne said.

""For example, foods like salmon, nuts and avocado contain nutrients and calories but are very healthy for us.""

Now, with all this talk of calories, it's important to mention that counting calories isn't the best way to manage or lose weight. While it's good to know about empty calories, both Gawthorne and Lowe recommend focusing on real, whole foods rather than their caloric value.

""I believe it's more important to focus on the health and nutritional value of food instead of calories,"" Gawthorne said.

Stick to these types of meals and leave junk food as a treat.

""It's good to be aware of calories in foods, especially when it comes to empty calories. However, I don't believe counting calories is a healthy way to lose weight. Counting calories can become an obsessive habit and take the focus off health and doesn't always lead to weight loss or improvements in health.

""When people count calories, they also often avoid foods that are nutrient dense and higher in calories (like those mentioned before -- fatty fish, nuts and so on) and replace them with lower calorie foods that have minimal nutritional benefit.""

Further, Lowe highlighted that to describe weight loss as 'energy in versus energy out' isn't telling the whole story. For example, 150 calories of chocolate will not be processed in the body the same way as 150 calories of fruit.

""One of the biggest myths is what we refer to here at The Natural Nutritionist as 'The Calorie Fallacy'. Physiology is not math or physics for that matter,"" Lowe said. ""It's about eating real food.""",What Are Empty Calorie Foods And Why Are They Bad?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/01/what-are-empty-calorie-foods-and-why-are-they-bad_a_23263969/

Ein 23-Jähriger hat einen Rettungseinsatz in Berlin behindert

Er regte sich darüber auf, dass sein Auto eingeparkt war

Bei dem Einsatz ging es um ein einjähriges Kind, das wiederbelebt werden musste

Es ist eine dieser Meldungen, die für empörtes Kopfschütteln sorgen.

Am Freitag hat sich ein 23-Jähriger in Berlin mit Polizei und Rettungskräften angelegt, weil sie sein Auto zugeparkt hatten. Die Sanitäter waren gerade dabei, einen einjährigen Jungen zu reanimieren, der in seiner Kita im Stadtteil Moabit beim Spielen plötzlich ohnmächtig geworden war.

Laut einem Bericht der ""Bild""-Zeitung stellte der Notarzt bei dem Kleinen Kammerflimmern fest und musste ihn an Ort und Stelle wiederbeleben.

""Mir doch egal, wer hier gerade reanimiert wird""

Dass es hier um das Leben eines Kleinkindes ging, scheint dem 23-jährigen Rüpel allerdings herzlich wenig interessiert zu haben. ""Mir doch egal, wer hier gerade reanimiert wird"", soll er laut ""Bild"" zu den Polizeibeamten gesagt haben, die ebenfalls angerückt waren.

Und das, obwohl die Lage völlig offensichtlich gewesen zu sein scheint. ""Ich habe ihm erklärt, dass wir gerade ein Kind reanimieren und den Rettungswagen jetzt nicht wegfahren können"", zitiert die ""Bild"" einen der Sanitäter. ""Doch der hat sich drohend vor mir aufgebaut, als ob er gleich zuschlagen will.""

Feuerwehr erstattet Anzeige gegen den Mann

Außerdem soll der Mann gebrüllt haben: ""Verpisst euch, ich muss zur Arbeit."" Laut der ""Berliner Zeitung"" wurde der Mann zudem handgreiflich und trat den Seitenspiegel des Rettungswagens ab.

Erst als die Polizisten den Mann in Schach hielten, konnten die Sanitäter demnach ihre Arbeit fortsetzen und das Kind reanimieren. Der Einjährige wurde auf die Kinderintensivstation gebracht, gegen den Mann hat die Feuerwehr Anzeige erstattet.

Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor of Hoboken, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. It has a picture of Bhalla, a Sikh who wears the traditional turban, with the words “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” directly above him.

The flyer also warns of a “potential conflict of interest” regarding the city’s water supplier, which is a client of the law firm where Bhalla is a partner. That issue, however, has no connection with terrorism and the explanation of the conflict appears in much smaller print.

“Of course, this is troubling, but I want to be clear: We won’t let hate win in Hoboken,” Bhalla wrote on Facebook. “I want people to know that Hoboken is a welcoming community where my wife and I are proud to raise our two young children.”

Sikhs have repeatedly been the victims of hate crimes and harassment by people who mistake them for Muslims. A 2015 study conducted by the National Sikhs Campaign found that 20 to 28 percent of Americans misidentify Sikh men as Middle Eastern or Muslim. A large part of that is due to the turbans that Sikh men wear as part of their faith.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tweeted in defense of Bhalla to denounce the flyers. Booker served as mayor of nearby Newark from 2006 to 2013, before running for Congress.

“My friend @RaviBhalla is running for Hoboken mayor,” Booker wrote. “This vile hateful flyer was put out. I condemn it! We all must condemn bigotry & hate!”

This isn’t the first racist incident during New Jersey’s local elections this year. Xenophobic mailers circulated earlier in the week over a school board election in Edison. They featured two Asian-American candidates with the word “deport” stamped on their pictures. The anonymous flyers also claimed, “The Chinese and Indians are taking over our town!”

The flyer falsely tying Bhalla to terrorism showed up just days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Language on the flyer claims it was paid for by a rival mayoral candidate, Michael DeFusco, who denies any association with the item.

“I condemn this piece of racist garbage in the strongest possible terms,” he said in a statement. “Political stunts like this are everything that’s wrong with politics today.”

A chiudere il candidato indipendentista Roberto La Rosa, all'1% in base alle proiezioni e allo 0,688 per i dati reali.

Guardando le proiezioni si assiste ad una forte incidenza del voto disgiunto che dalle liste di centrosinistra ha visto una ""migrazione"" di preferenze a favore del candidato grillino. Le liste provinciali del centrosinistra, infatti, hanno raccolto il 26,6%, a fronte del candidato presidente fermo al 18%, facile immaginare che lo scarto di preferenze sia confluito sul nome di Cancelleri. Il movimento 5 stelle, infatti, pur essendo il primo partito dell'isola, è al 28,2%, con quasi 8 punti di stacco dal candidato grillino (36%).

En contra de los pronósticos y encuestas, el partido de gobierno se adjudicó el triunfo en 18 gobernaciones de un total de 23 estados. Solo en 5 gobernaciones la oposición consiguió un mayor número de votos.

Luis Lander, director del Observatorio Venezolano Electoral (OVE).

Estamos leyendo el comunicado suscrito por cuatro españoles que fueron invitados por el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) para actuar como observadores internacionales, uno de los dos grupos que fueron acreditados por el ente electoral. Siendo el otro, el CEELA, Consejo de Expertos Electorales de Latinoamérica, una ONG fundada a instancias del presidente Hugo Chávez en el 2004.

La organización que dirige, el ingeniero Luis Lander, Observatorio Venezolano Electoral, no recibió el beneplácito del ente electoral, asegurando que debido a la premura con la que se convocaron las elecciones, no hubo tiempo para emitir las credenciales a las 500 personas que conforman esta ONG.

El grupo de españoles estuvo conformado por tres dirigentes políticos y por un periodista: Javier Couso, eurodiputado de Izquierda Unida; la senadora Sara Vilà, de Podemos; la parlamentaria gallega Eva Solla de En Marea; y el periodista Carlos Enrique Bayo, del diario Público.

Nuestra primera objeción es la metodología de selección aleatoria de las 120 mesas de votación

Los observadores españoles, aseveran en su comunicado que ""el proceso electoral ha cumplido todos los requisitos y garantías de limpieza y transparencia exigibles a unos comicios"". Una conclusión refutable.

Nuestra primera objeción es la metodología de selección aleatoria de las 120 mesas de votación que ellos observaron ¿cómo se escogió la muestra para representar el universo de 30.274 mesas electorales, distribuidas en un territorio de un millón de kilómetros cuadrados? puesto que no lo explican en su comunicado.

El comunicado de los observadores españoles se refiere a que la oposición contó ""con medios y libertad más que suficientes para desarrollar su campaña""

El ingeniero Luis Lander no desconfía de las máquinas sumadoras, no desconfía de los programas, ni de las máquinas capta huellas, aunque me aclara, que la base de datos de huellas está en construcción. Luis Lander me informa que hubo inconvenientes en la realización de las auditorías que debieron realizarse en un 54% de las mesas electorales, no se realizaron en muchos casos como un acto público, a pesar de que la ley estipula la participación de cualquier ciudadano.

Los problemas surgen cuando el proceso informatizado es interrumpido, continúa explicándome. Varios de los candidatos a las gobernaciones, con copias de las actas de votación en mano, han denunciado que hubo alteración de los resultados por la manipulación de la data en centros de votación que se ubican en aldeas remotas, donde no hay comunicación telefónica y los resultados no son transmitidos electrónicamente.

Destaca el caso del candidato a la gobernación del estado Bolívar, Andrés Velasquéz, del partido La Causa R quien introdujo un recurso por fraude. El CNE todavía no ha respondido a su denuncia.

En la web del Colegio Nacional de Periodistas de Venezuela se puede leer el informe ""Periodistas y medios de prensa de Venezuela son censurados y agredidos durante elecciones regionales""

Otro de los puntos del comunicado de los observadores españoles se refiere a que la oposición contó ""con medios y libertad más que suficientes para desarrollar su campaña"". En la página web del Colegio Nacional de Periodistas de Venezuela, puede leerse el informe titulado: ""Periodistas y medios de prensa de Venezuela son censurados y agredidos durante elecciones regionales."" Donde se hace énfasis en el cierre de 50 emisoras de radio de línea editorial opositora en los últimos meses. Además en dicha página web se reportan los casos de las agresiones verbales y físicas a periodistas que intentaron cubrir las recientes elecciones regionales.

Como es costumbre en las elecciones en Venezuela, los medios de comunicación que son propiedad del estado venezolano, son utilizados para hacer campaña política a favor del partido de gobierno, a través de propaganda y entrevistas. Según la ONG Espacio Público en el 2012, el gobierno controla unos seis canales de televisión, y 200 emisoras de radio, además de numerosos periódicos y diarios.

Las alocuciones del presidente Maduro no estuvieron exentas de propaganda a favor de sus candidatos. En cadena nacional de medios públicos y privados, se refirió a ellos, ofreciéndoles cuantiosos recursos para sus futuras gestiones.

Se produjeron graves incidentes en algunos centros de votación

Se produjeron graves incidentes en algunos centros de votación. Algunos centros de trayectoria opositora, fueron cerrados pocos días antes de las elecciones, obligando a sus votantes a presentarse en otros centros, alejados y de difícil acceso. Unos 700.000 electores se vieron afectados.

Se reportó presencia de los llamados colectivos o las bandas de motorizados armados en Guarenas y Guatire. También se colocaron puntos rojos cerca de centros de votación en la populosa zona de Petare, donde los votantes mostraban su carnet de la patria antes de votar.

Una lectura de la prensa del día nos da una idea de las irregularidades y de los hechos de violencia que se reportaron, a tal punto que muchos testigos de la oposición fueron sacados de los centros de votación a partir de las 6 de la tarde. Los centros funcionaron hasta las 8 de la noche sin su presencia. Así lo ha denunciado el candidato de la gobernación del estado Miranda.

Según la Red de Observación Electoral de la Asamblea Nacional de Educación es ""imposible considerar la elección de gobernadores como expresión fiel de la voluntad ciudadana""

Luis Lander me refiere a los informes de la Red de Observación Electoral de la Asamblea Nacional de Educación, una de las dos organizaciones que sí fueron acreditadas como observadores nacionales. En su informe disponible en internet, esta ONG, asevera que las elecciones regionales padecieron de numerosos vicios y por tal motivo es ""Imposible considerar elección de gobernadores como expresión fiel de la voluntad ciudadana"".

A la fecha, dos semanas después de haberse realizado las elecciones, no se está realizando una auditoría del 100% de las actas como indicaron los observadores españoles. A pesar de que la auditoría de la totalidad de las actas ha sido solicitada por la coalición de partidos opositores.

A single mother will be £2,236 worse off under the government’s Universal Credit benefit than they would have been if Labour’s tax credit system had been left in place, research published on Monday has revealed. According to the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), the government’s flagship benefits reform is a “colossal failure” that will leave a generation of children “scarred” by austerity. The analysis, conducted with the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), also calculated that one million more children are likely to be in poverty in 2020 as a result of cuts to the new benefit programme. According to the data, the freezes and cuts to Universal Credit work allowances will leave lone parents worse off by, on average, £710 a year, couples £250 a year. And a single parent already working full time on the national living wage would have to work an extra 41 days a year to make up for the losses suffered as a result of the cuts.

Theresa May is under pressure from backbench Tory MPs as well as the Labour Party to pause the roll-out of the system - or make significant changes to how Universal Credit operates. The new benefit system, the brainchild of Iain Duncan Smith, combines six of the main welfare benefits into a single payment. It is designed to both simplify the system and encourage people back into work. David Cameron promised in 2009 in his party conference speech that Duncan Smith was the “one person this party can rely on” to tackle child poverty. But Alison Garnham, the chief executive, of CPAG, said today that pledge “has been broken”.","Universal Credit Leaving Children 'Scarred' By Poverty, Warns Think-Tank",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/universal-credit-leaving-children-scarred-by-poverty-warns-think-tank_uk_59ff3f34e4b0baea26324bcf?9ok&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

The man said that Spacey, 24 at the time, “told me how he was in love with me” before he went to the actor’s apartment and began a sexual relationship that comprised several encounters. Spacey attempted unwanted penetrative sex in their last encounter, he said, and it ended when the teenager ran outside.

“I would call him a pedophile and a sexual predator,” the man told New York Magazine.

PREVIOUSLY:

Several men have now shared stories of being sexually harassed by Kevin Spacey after “Star Trek: Discovery” actor Anthony Rapp came forward with his own story earlier this week.

In an interview with BuzzFeed, Rapp said that the “House of Cards” star invited him to a party and made a sexual advance toward him on a bed in the 1980s. At the time, Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. In response, Spacey posted a widely criticized apology to Twitter on Monday that contained his first public declaration of being gay.

On Tuesday, film director Tony Montana told Radar Online that Spacey groped him in 2003. HuffPost confirmed the story with Montana.

“He grabbed me very hard,” Montana told HuffPost.

The “Overnight” documentarian said he was ordering a drink at a bar in 2003 when Spacey put an arm around him and made a joke about the title of a movie he’d recently been in. Then he tried to convince Montana to leave with him, the filmmaker said.

Montana told Radar Spacey “grabbed my whole package.”

“This designates ownership,” Montana recalled the actor telling him.

Montana said that Spacey then followed him into the bathroom, after which Montana told the actor’s friends to take him home, and the group ended up leaving.

Montana hopes that sharing his story has an impact “not just regarding issues of sexual harassment, but people using power in other threatening manners in Hollywood.”

“I would hope that is going to lessen, if not go away,” he told HuffPost. “I hope that this isn’t just a phase, it isn’t just a cycle that’s going to come and go.”

On Wednesday, a man who wished to remain anonymous shared another story, on BBC 2′s “Victoria Derbyshire” program, saying that he spent a weekend at the actor’s New York City home as a 17-year-old in the mid-’80s. Spacey allegedly pressured the teen into sharing his bed and “was sobbing” when his guest refused the offer.

“In the morning, I woke up and [Spacey’s] head was on my stomach and his arms were wrapped around my torso, very affectionately, I would suppose,” the man said. “He certainly wasn’t aggressive, but it was affectionate and certainly not something I was comfortable with as a heterosexual male.”

The two had met at a summer theater program. Spacey would have been in his mid-20s at the time.

“I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst,” the man said, per the BBC.

Another story about the “House of Cards” star appeared in the British tabloid The Sun on Tuesday. The publication reported that Spacey exposed himself in 2010 to a man named Daniel Beal, who was working as a bartender at an English hotel.

The allegations have been enough to concern London’s Old Vic theater, where Spacey served as artistic director from 2004 to 2015. While the theater claims no complaints were made against Spacey during his tenure there, it released a statement Tuesday expressing its “deep dismay” about its former employee’s alleged misbehavior.

“We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level,” the statement read. Old Vic has opened a tip line, confidential@oldvictheatre.com, for those who have been involved with its productions to share any complaints anonymously.

However, a report published Wednesday in the Guardian claims that “a number of people” have contacted the publication with stories about misbehavior by Spacey during his time as artistic director at the Old Vic. Citing stories by one anonymous and one named source, the publication accused the theater of ignoring past complaints.

According to Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, unwanted sexual advances toward younger men were “common” when Spacey was at the Old Vic. In a Spanish-language Facebook post shared Monday, Cavazos said he personally experienced behavior that was “on the borderline of being considered assault.” Spacey would allegedly make his advances after inviting younger actors to meet with him to talk about their careers ― setting up Champagne picnics on stage as a meeting spot ― or else he would approach men at bars.

“Those of us who knew him in London when he was director of the Old Vic Theatre know that there will be many more victims who will dare to tell their stories in the next days and weeks,” he wrote. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the numbers were similar to those of Weinstein.”

Harvey Weinstein, the now former head of The Weinstein Company, stands accused by more than 50 women of sexual harassment and assault.

Netflix, home of “House of Cards,” announced this week that the upcoming sixth season of the fan-favorite series would be its last.

Je considère Houria Bouteldja comme une camarade, parce qu'elle fait partie de ce mouvement-là.

Interrogée sur le fait de savoir si les propos de Mme Bouteldja - qui affirmait en mars 2015 que ""Les juifs sont les boucliers, les tirailleurs de la politique impérialiste française et de sa politique islamophobe"" - étaient des propos racistes ou antiracistes, la députée de Paris a simplement répondu: ""Je ne sais pas"". Quant à la photo présentant la porte-parole du PIR à côté d'une pancarte ""Les sionistes au goulag"", Danièle Obono a jugé qu'il s'agissait d'une ""photo de très mauvais goût"", qui n'était ""pas acceptable"".

Pour autant, la députée ""respecte la militante antiraciste. C'est dans le mouvement antiraciste que je l'ai connue, c'est dans ces luttes-là que l'on s'est battues"". Une ambiguïté immédiatement critiquée sur les réseaux sociaux où circulent des extraits (tronqués) de prises de parole de Houria Bouteldja se comparant à Mohamed Merah.

Des propos qui ""n'engagent qu'elle""

Porte-parole de Jean-Luc Mélenchon sur les questions internationales, Djordje Kuzmanovic a tenu à se démarquer de la position de Danièle Obono. ""Je ne soutiens pas Houria Bouteldja, porte-parole du PIR, parti racialiste, antisémite et communautariste opposé aux valeurs de la République"", a-t-il tweeté, sans citer la députée de Paris. Une prise de distance notable dans un mouvement qui a pour habitude de faire bloc face aux critiques politiques.

""Mon seul programme est celui de la France Insoumise, l'Avenir en commun""

Ce n'est pas la première fois que Danièle Obono est mise en cause pour ses activités militantes présentes ou passées.

""Quand je fais cette déclaration en 2015, c'est dans un débat dans le mouvement antiraciste. Je ne crois pas que Dieudonné fasse partie du mouvement antiraciste, parce que c'est un raciste. Donc nous ne faisons pas partie du même camp, c'est un ennemi et voilà, je ne suis pas d'accord avec lui. Je n'ai rien à voir avec quelqu'un qui défend des idées racistes et antisémites.

Lenders look at your credit score, also known as your FICO score, to gauge how likely you are to pay back the money they lend you for a mortgage, auto loan or credit card. Credit scores range from 300 on the low end to 850 on the high end. A “good” credit score is generally considered something in the low 700s or above. Once you get down below 600, it’s hard to get anyone to lend to you at all. 6. You Should Basically Never Check Your 401(k) Statement

POLITIQUE - D'une promotion à l'autre. Un an après avoir remporté le très prestigieux prix Goncourt pour son roman ""Chanson douce"", l'écrivaine Leïla Slimani va être nommée ce lundi 6 novembre représentante personnelle du président Emmanuel Macron pour la francophonie. L'information dévoilée par Le Parisien a été confirmée par l'Elysée à l'AFP. L'auteure doit être reçue cet après-midi à 15h par le chef de l'Etat pour un entretien en tête à tête à l'issue duquel sa nomination devrait être officialisée.

Ecrivaine franco-marocaine engagée, membre de la société civile, soutien d'Emmanuel Macron, considérée comme une proche du couple présidentiel et un temps pressentie au ministère de la Culture, Leïla Slimani correspond en tous points au profil recherché par Emmanuel Macron pour porter son combat en faveur de la langue française. D'autant que le gouvernement d'Edouard Philippe ne compte aucun portefeuille ministériel dédié au monde francophone.

Peu engagé sur ce thème pendant sa campagne présidentielle, le plus anglophone des présidents de la Ve République a depuis cet été présenté la francophonie comme une ""chance formidable"" et un ""facteur d'attractivité"" pour l'Hexagone. Emmanuel Macron a promis de présenter un plan global ""pour la promotion de la langue française et du plurilinguisme dans le monde"" d'ici le premier semestre 2018. Devant l'Assemblée des Français de l'étranger, le chef de l'Etat a indiqué qu'il recevrait en début d'année ""intellectuels, universitaires, artistes, entreprises engagées de la francophonie à l'Elysée"" pour arrêter une stratégie.

Ein Mann hat Geiseln im Jugendamt von Pfaffenhofen genommen

Medienberichten zufolge soll der Hintergrund ein Sorgerechtsstreit sein

Die Geiselnahme im Jugendamt in des Landkreises Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm hat die Polizei beendet. Ein 28-jähriger Mann, der eine Sachbearbeiterin über Stunden in seiner Gewalt hatte, sei festgenommen worden, sagte ein Sprecher am Montag. Ein Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) nutzte nach den Angaben einen günstigen Moment, um den Mann zu überwältigen.

Der Geiselnehmer hatte sich gegen 8.30 Uhr mit der Sachbearbeiterin am Jugendamt des oberbayerischen Landkreises verbarrikadiert. Er bedrohte die 31-Jährige mit einem Messer mit zehn Zentimeter langer Klinge. Die Frau erlitt eine Schnittwunde am Oberkörper. Ob er weitere Waffen bei sich hatte, war zunächst unklar.

Polizei: ""Der Täter spricht mit uns""

Das Gebäude in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft des Landratsamtes in Pfaffenhofen war am Morgen kurz nach der Geiselnahme geräumt worden. Danach befanden sich lediglich Opfer und Täter in dem Haus, erläuterte der Sprecher.

Es begann ein stundenlanger Nervenkrieg: Die Polizei war mit einem Großaufgebot vor Ort. Auch mehrere Krankenwagen und Ärzte sowie Sanitäter wurden zum Tatort geschickt.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Geiselnahme in dem Jugendamt baten die Ermittler darum, keine Bilder oder Videos vom Tatort zu verbreiten. Solche Bilder im Netz könnten dem Täter helfen, twitterte die Polizei.

Bitte unterstützt uns bei unserer Arbeit in #Pfaffenhofen und verbreitet KEINE Bilder, Videos etc. Ihr helft damit dem Täter. — Polizei Oberbayern N (@polizeiOBN) 6. November 2017

Unterdessen nahm die Verhandlungsgruppe telefonisch Kontakt mit dem Geiselnehmer auf. Die speziell für Geiselnahmen geschulten Beamten versuchten, deeskalierend auf den Mann einzuwirken.

Als die Frau darum bat, dass ein Arzt gerufen wird, griff das SEK zu und überwältigte den 28-Jährigen. Es kam dabei nicht zu einem Schusswaffeneinsatz.

Die 31-jährige Sachbearbeiterin war nach den Angaben psychisch stabil. Sie habe lediglich eine leichte Schürfwunde. Es könne derzeit nicht eingeordnet werden, woher die Verletzung rührt.

Wieso es keine Bilder vom Ort der Geiselnahme geben soll

Das Opfer sei zwar psychisch angegriffen, körperlich aber nicht schwer verletzt, teilte die Polizei weiter mit. Auch der mutmaßliche Täter sei weitgehend unverletzt.

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

Von Jenna B.

Ihr wisst sicher einiges über Depressionen.

Ihr wisst, dass Menschen mit Depressionen sich oft traurig und leer fühlen, keinen Appetit haben oder schlecht schlafen können. Dass sie müde sind und dass ihnen Dinge keine Freude mehr bereiten, die sie normalerweise lieben würden. Und dass sie vielleicht sogar an den Tod und ans Sterben denken.

Doch ein Symptom von Depressionen, von dem ihr wahrscheinlich noch nicht gehört habt und gleichzeitig eines, das mit am schwersten zu ertragen ist: Einsamkeit.

Wir Menschen sehnen uns nach Nähe. Sogar die meisten Introvertierten wollen mit kleinen Gruppen oder einzelnen Personen in Interaktion treten.

Doch wenn ich mich depressiv fühle, kann ich mich selbst nicht dazu bringen, Verabredungen auszumachen oder einzuhalten. Manchmal kann ich nicht mal duschen und mich anziehen, geschweige denn das Haus verlassen.

Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut

Doch das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Gesellschaft möchte. Im Gegenteil: Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut. Doch ich habe Angst, jemanden zu fragen.

Ich weiß, dass ich andere damit belaste. Und ich weiß auch, dass es keinen Spaß macht, mit mir Zeit zu verbringen, weil ich immer traurig bin und es mir schwer fällt, die Dinge zu genießen, die ich früher gerne mochte.

Ich fühle mich schuldig, dass ich diese Gesellschaft möchte, dass ich jemanden in meiner Nähe brauche.

Wenn ich mich sehr schlimm niedergeschlagen fühle, sehne ich mich nach jemanden, mit dem ich sprechen kann und der mich versteht, ohne mich zu verurteilen. Doch ich bekomme meinen Mund nicht auf, um nach der Hilfe zu fragen, die ich brauche.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt

Ich bin gefangen in meinem eigenen Kopf und ich kann mich innerlich schreien hören. Doch leider kann niemand meine Gedanken lesen.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt und desto weniger Kraft habe ich, mit anderen Menschen in Kontakt zu treten. Doch das ist genau der Zeitpunkt, an dem ich am meisten auf jemanden angewiesen bin, der sieht, was mit mir los ist.

Es ist traurig, dass die Symptome von Depressionen dafür sorgen, dass du so viele Freunde verlierst. Wegen des Stigmas, das der Krankheit anhaftet, oder weil sie nicht verstehen oder Angst haben oder nicht wissen, wie sie helfen sollen. Oder weil sie beschäftigt sind und nicht gestört werden wollen.

Denn manchmal ist der beste Weg, einem Freund oder geliebten Person mit Depressionen zu begegnen, einfach Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen und zu tun, wonach ihm ist.

Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen

Auch wenn das nur ein Netflix-Abend auf der Couch ist oder ein gemeinsamer Kaffee oder ein Abendessen. Allein dadurch, dass du dich um deinen Freund oder deine Freundin kümmerst, hilft ihm oder ihr, sich besser zu fühlen.

Sogar wenn der Andere deine Worte der Beschwichtigung und des Trostes nicht zu hören scheint, kann deine Anwesenheit sehr wertvoll für ihn sein. Es tut immer gut zu wissen, dass jemand sich um dich sorgt und aufrichtige, liebevolle Worte zu hören.

Mir hilft das immer sehr, wenn ich depressiv bin. Es erinnert mich daran, dass ich diese Liebe verdient habe und hilft mir, an meiner Selbstliebe zu arbeiten, die mich aus der Depression herausziehen kann.

Wenn ihr also einen Freund oder Liebsten habt, der unter Depressionen leidet, erinnert euch bitte immer daran: Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen. Depressionen sind eine Krankheit, die sehr einsam macht. Und Nähe zu anderen Menschen ist extrem wichtig bei der Genesung.

The satisfying weight, the even heating and cooking, the natural non-stick abilities, the way you can chuck it in a hot oven, and they last for literal lifetimes.

Not to mention the fact that cooking in a cast iron pan can add significant amounts of iron to your food and body.

One thing cast iron pans do require, however, is some love and care every so often. But the positive cooking experience using cast iron certainly outweighs this negative.

If you're confused about looking after your cast iron pan -- including how to season it and what to do when your pan is rusty -- we've got you covered.

How to clean a cast iron pan

Daily clean

When you're washing your cast iron pan after everyday use, wash it with warm water and a kitchen sponge. While cast iron purists recommend not using dish washing liquid as it could remove the seasoning, others are more easygoing about it. Either way, don't go scrubbing your pan too hard.

Once your pan is clean, it's important to dry the pan thoroughly straightaway as water is cast iron's enemy. Simply hand-dry the pan with a tea towel, then place it on the hob over high heat to evaporate the remaining moisture.

Deep clean

So your cast iron pan is looking a little rusty and whatever you're cooking tends to stick more than usual. Don't worry, it's salvageable. It's just time to give your pan a deep clean.

What you'll need is some course salt, water and a stiff brush, steel wool or green cleansing pad. Splash your pan with water, add some salt and start scrubbing away the rust. Then rinse your pan well until the water runs clear, dry it off thoroughly (with a tea towel and place it in the oven for 10 minutes) and it's ready for seasoning.

How to season a cast iron pan

Now that you've got a clean and bare cast iron pan, it's time to re-season it, which doesn't mean rubbing spices on it. Because iron on its own is reactive and will rust (and stick), you need to season the pan by applying oil and heating it so it creates a sturdy layer of non-stick goodness.

The oil you should use to season cast iron is one with a neutral flavour and high smoking point, so vegetable or rice bran oil. Olive oil may become rancid and impart big flavour which you do not want.

When you apply oil to the pan, rub it all over (even the bottom!) and heat it in the oven for one hour at 230°C plus, the oil undergoes a chemical reaction and becomes a polymer (a stronger molecular bond), so you're locking that non-stick layer on the pan. Doing this method correctly makes your cast iron pan stay seasoned and conditioned.

Tip: place the pan upside down in the oven and place a baking tray underneath the baking shelf to catch any excess oil. Leave the pan in the oven for one hour, then you're done.

From this point on, with regular use of your cast iron pan you'll know when it needs to be re-seasoned when food begins to stick or the pan looks more metallic or begins to rust.",How To Clean And Season A Cast Iron Pan,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/02/how-to-clean-and-season-a-cast-iron-pan_a_23264069/

Je n'ai pas crié, je n'ai rien dit à personne, je me suis cachée en entier dans ma honte et mon dégoût de ce premier baiser forcé, volé, humiliant qui disait haut et fort que les hommes pouvaient consommer ma peau et même avoir ma peau.

J'ai seize ans, j'ai raté la correspondance de mon train, je décide de faire de l'auto stop. Très vite un automobiliste s'arrête. Il quitte brusquement la nationale et prend une départementale, il a soit disant un colis à déposer ...j'ouvre la portière et je sauté en marche en prenant tous les risques, notamment qu'il revienne et je cours de peur qu'il me tue...

Je suis étudiante à Paris 7, j'ouvre la porte de mon immeuble et je sens le corps d'un homme qui me pousse en avant, je me retourne et je hurle en donnant un coup avec mon genou dans ses couilles...il s'est sauvé en courant et moi, je le suivais le menaçant.

J'ai grandi en comprenant que c'était la guerre. En stratège féminin, je me suis inventée des armures, des gilets de sauvetage, des ceintures de sécurité, j'ai porté des armes inutiles; j'ai fait du judo et j'ai compris qu'il valait mieux s'entraîner à la course à pied, fuir et ne pas se battre parce qu'à musculature égale, les hommes sont plus forts. Dans les couloirs déserts du métro, j'écoute les pas qui résonnent. La peur s'est glissée sous ma peau et fait bloc dans sa tête. J'intériorise les scénarios de self-défense pour éviter la prédation masculine qu'elle soit visuelle, tactile ou verbale. Dans la rue et ailleurs, les garçons se promènent rêvent et lisent tranquilles.

J'ai quarante ans, les flèches de la cathédrale de Chartres déchirent les lumières du ciel. Le Ter Paris-Le Mans se vide. Dans le compartiment reste deux voyageurs, deux mecs. Si l'un d'eux descend à la prochaine station, je serai seule avec un type forcément capable de tout. La nuit s'installe, la peur aussi. Les femmes disent qu'elles ne veulent plus faire ce trajet en train et préfèrent rester chez elles dans le Perche plutôt que d'aller se divertir à Paris.

J'aime les garçons, j'aime trop quand nos regards se croisent dans ces moments improbables d'assentiments alchimiques sensuels et amoureux, même que c'est trop bien quand on se drague les uns et les autres dans la rue et ailleurs. Sauf que dans l'espace privé ou public, ce n'est pas équitable, les hommes de la famille ou d'autres peuvent abuser de nos corps. Tous les jours dans le Perche que traverse ce Ter Paris-Le Mans des petites filles perdent leur virginité au monde, les assistantes sociales le savent mais soumises au secret professionnel, elles doivent se taire. Malgré les luttes de nos mères pour l'égalité des femmes et des hommes, dès notre naissance nous sommes des proies potentielles, des candidates au silence, des soumises à la domination au boulot et ailleurs, et pourtant on fait la guerre au quotidien pour ne pas vivre en alerte permanente. Les tribunaux ne sont d'aucun intérêt. Le vrai changement doit s'opérer dans les comportements et les mentalités de tous et de toutes, relevons la tête et revendiquons le droit de marcher, de travailler, de rêver sans être victime voire consentante de livrer nos sexes sans désirer celui de l'autre mais parfois avons-nous vraiment le choix.

Parlons, témoignons, touche pas à ma potesse, touche pas à ma mère, touche pas à ma fille si elle en n'a pas envie. Heureusement il y a plein de garçons qui ont compris cela, qu'ils témoignent contre ceux qui les salissent en tant qu'homme et qui compliquent les relations amoureuses entre les hommes et les femmes.

C'est une convocation planétaire, un enjeu pour toutes les petites filles de demain, parlons,répétons...

Souvenez-vous, battez-vous, écrivez même les noms des prédateurs. Si nous voulons que la société change, ne soyez pas complice en restant silencieuse, quant aux mauvais garçons, la prochaine fois si vous ne voulez pas que votre nom éclate au grand jour, demandez mais n'insistez pas si une fille n' a pas envie de votre sexe

Alors, lentement mais sûrement, le fait de naître fille ne sera plus un handicap à la liberté de rêver, de se promener, de travailler sans revêtir des peurs imaginaires ou réelles.

Visti da molti come ""pesi morti"" che lo Stato si ""accolla"" a scapito dei tanti italiani in difficoltà, non vengono considerati per quello che sono: profughi che rischiano la vita attraversando il Mediterraneo su barconi stracolmi perché non hanno alternative.

L'hate speech su queste vicende, come sul caso di Salerno, si sviluppa in crescendo e ciò impone una riflessione e, soprattutto, una reazione. Ferma.

Fast-forward more than a century - and the deep ocean floor around Antarctica still offers a ""white space"", beyond the reach of scuba divers, only partially mapped in detail by sonar from ships and seldom surveyed by robotic vehicles.

So I jumped at the chance to join a team from the BBC on an expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula for Blue Planet II, to help them as a scientific guide. Thanks to the crew of the research ship Alucia, we dived in minisubmarines to 1km deep in the Antarctic for the first time. And while we didn't face anything like the physical hardships endured by early polar explorers on land, those dives did give us the opportunity for some unique science.

The deep ocean around Antarctica is a special place for several reasons. Because Antarctica is pushed down by the weight of its ice sheets, the submerged continental shelf around it is deeper than usual, around 500-600m deep at its edge rather than 100-200m deep. It's also cut by even deeper channels close inshore, some plunging more than 1km, scoured out by larger ice sheets in the past. So although the continent itself is remote, we can reach the deep ocean close inshore here - handy for us diving in minisubmarines, despite the need to dodge icebergs.

Giant sponges found in the deep waters of the Antarctic.

There's a gateway to the deep for marine life here too. Some deep-sea animals come into much shallower depths than usual around Antarctica, because the water temperature near the surface is similar to the cold temperatures elsewhere in the deep ocean. And in the past, shallow-living ancestors of some deep-sea animals spread out across the deep oceans from the Antarctic, via this cold gateway between the shallows and the deep.

One of my favourite animals that we saw on dives was the octopus Graneledone antarctica, whose ancestor ventured down from the shallows around 15m years ago, when the water temperature at the surface cooled to the same chilly temperature as the deep. Her descendants then spread out across the abyss like wagon-train pioneers, giving rise to several different species of deep-sea octopus found around the world today. Some stayed behind, however, becoming the species that we saw.

The ocean around Antarctica is also the lungs of the deep. Much of the life-giving oxygen in deep waters across the world begins its journey from the atmosphere here. As seawater freezes around the white continent in winter, it leaves behind very cold and salty water that sinks and flows into the depths of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans - even the deepest water in the ocean, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench 14,000km away, came from here. As this deep water flows out from the Antarctic, it carries oxygen, dissolved from the atmosphere at the surface. So the Antarctic is where the world's deep oceans breathe in - and its waters are among the most oxygen-rich on our planet.

The #BluePlanet2 team were the first humans ever to dive to a depth of a thousand metres in Antarctica #EarthOnLocation by @jameshoneybornepic.twitter.com/KlyWu0VcbQ — BBC Earth (@BBCEarth) November 3, 2017

Another of my favourite animals from our dives takes advantage of those oxygen-rich waters: giant sea-spiders, with legspans up to 40cm across. Sea spiders lack a respiratory system, which usually limits their size, but can grow much larger in the oxygen-rich conditions here.

'Ancient ocean ecosystems'

Diving in the Antarctic is also a journey back in time, to glimpse what ancient ocean ecosystems were once like. Fish dominate as predators in most marine ecosystems today, but few fish species can cope with the -1.5℃ conditions where we were diving. The ""ice dragonfish"", Cryodraco antarcticus, is a notable exception, however, and another of my favourite animals - with antifreeze proteins that stop its blood from icing up. Its blood is also clear, without any of the oxygen-carrying haemoglobin that gives ours its red colour - in the cold waters, enough oxygen dissolves directly in the fluid of the fish's blood to keep it alive.

But there are few fish with remarkable adaptations like the ice dragon, and so invertebrates have diversified to dominate as predators in the deep ocean here, just as they did throughout the oceans more than 350m years ago. A final favourite from our dives epitomises that: the Antarctic sunstar Labidiaster annulatus, which is a relative of the familiar five-armed starfish. Nicknamed ""the Death Star"" by those inside the subs who watched its behaviour, it has up to 50 arms and grows larger than a dinner plate. It uses those arms like fishing rods, holding them up off the seabed to snag passing krill, thanks to tiny pincers on its skin that snap shut when anything brushes past them. Unlike other starfish, Labidiaster can wave its arms to catch prey here because there are relatively few predatory fish to chew them off.

A feather star dances in the deep waters of the Antarctic Sound.

Overall, seeing the deep Antarctic sea floor close-up from our minisubs should help us to understand how ""dropstones"" shape the pattern of life here. ""Dropstones"" are car-sized boulders that fall from passing icebergs - they provide ""islands"" of rocky habitat for filter-feeding species which otherwise don't get a look-in on the soft mud of the Antarctic seafloor. But where the dropstones settle depends on the undersea terrain. As we found on our dives, they slide down steeper undersea slopes, actually scraping off marine life. But if you're at the bottom of a gully, then lots of dropstones end up there, giving a major boost to local biodiversity. That pattern of life is hard to see from samples collected by nets or trawls in the past, so our first minisub dives to 1km deep in the Antarctic should help to make that ""white space"" no longer such a blank.

Union Power Minister R K Singh, through social media posts, expressed deep anguish at the loss of lives and said that he had directed NTPC Chairman and Managing Director Gurdeep Singh to rush to the site.

The Unchahar sub-division in Rae Bareli, which is represented by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Parliament, is around 110 km from the state capital.

ADG Kumar said that all available ambulances were pressed into service, and the additional district magistrate and the additional superintendent of police were on the spot to supervise relief and rescue operations.

Chief Minister Adityanath, on a three-day official visit to Mauritius, ordered that necessary steps be taken for rescue and relief.

The chief minister has taken cognisance of the Unchahar accident and has directed the principal secretary (home) to ensure that all steps were taken for rescue and relief, principal secretary (information) Awanish Awasthi, who is accompanying Adityanath, said.

Compensation

""The chief minister expressed his condolences over the deaths of workers in the Unchahar NTPC unit and announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the family of those killed and Rs 50,000 for the grievously injured, besides Rs 25,000 for other injured workers,"" Awasthi said.

A National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team was also despatched to the explosion site from the state capital for relief and rescue operations, an official said.

The explosion triggered panic among the employees who ran helter-skelter. Such explosions can generate searing heat, an official said.

An injured employee undergoing treatment at a hospital said that a sudden gush of hot gas with contents of ash-like material engulfed him at the NTPC plant.

The man said he was unable to understand what had happened and found himself on a hospital bed with his body scalded all over, when he regained consciousness.

The plant area was cordoned off by the police to facilitate smooth running of ambulances. Two companies of the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) have been sent to the plant as reinforcement.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi expressed shock and horror at the ""terrible tragedy"" in her Lok Sabha constituency. Conveying her deepest condolences to the families of the bereaved, Gandhi urged upon the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will take a break from election campaign in Gujarat to visit Rae Bareli tomorrow to meet the families of the victims.

""Due to the unfortunate NTPC accident, I will visit Rae Bareli tomorrow morning,"" he said on Twitter.

District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri told PTI that 40 ambulances were immediately pressed into service.

Chief Medical Officer of Rae Bareli D K Singh, along with a team of 10 doctors, was deployed to carry out immediate treatment to the injured, the district magistrate said.

He also said that arrangements have been made to bring the serious cases to KGMU Hospital and the Civil Hospital in Lucknow. Some of the injured were being sent to Rae Bareli, Khatri said.

CMO Singh said that, if necessary, some of the critical cases could be referred to Delhi by air ambulance.","20 Killed, 100 Injured In Massive Boiler Explosion At NTPC's Rae Bareli Plant",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/01/20-killed-100-injured-in-massive-boiler-explosion-at-ntpcs-rae-bareli-plant_a_23264018/

Focuses on mental health.","President Donald Trump responded to the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history by saying the attack was a result of “a mental health problem” and not due to lax gun control laws.

During a news conference Monday in Tokyo, Trump said it was “a little bit soon” to get into a discussion about gun control.

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said, noting that a person in the crowd with a gun shot at the attacker and caused him to flee. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

The president woke on Monday morning in Japan to the news that a lone gunman had opened fire on churchgoers at a small Baptist church in rural Texas and killed at least 26 people and injured another 20. The dead and wounded range in age from 5 to 72 years old.

While answering questions in Tokyo, the president referred to the gunman, who multiple reports identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, as a “very deranged individual.”

Earlier on Monday, Trump tweeted his prayers to the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas, before giving an official statement on the shooting at a meeting with U.S. and Japanese business leaders in Tokyo.

C'è chi dice che Di Maio ha sbagliato, ma la storia politica è piena di candidati in vantaggio che ritardano o rifiutano sfide televisive con competitor che potrebbero solo guadagnare punti in un match pubblico.","Luigi Di Maio aveva paura del confronto con Renzi? Teme il segretario Pd? Non vuole ""bruciarsi"" al primo confronto televisivo con l'ex presidente del Consiglio, che in ogni caso resta un comunicatore brillante? Anche se tutto ciò fosse vero, Di Maio ha colto il momento giusto per ""scaricare"" Renzi.

Nelle ore in cui Musumeci, alfiere del centrodestra in Sicilia, è accreditato della probabile vittoria, e nelle stesse ore in cui l'esito del voto isolano sembra comunque oscillare tra grillini e centrodestra, Di Maio ha buon gioco a dire:

""Avevo chiesto il confronto con Renzi qualche giorno fa, quando lui era il candidato premier di quella parte politica. Il terremoto del voto in Sicilia ha completamente cambiato questa prospettiva. Mi confronterò con la persona che sarà indicata come candidato premier da quel partito o quella coalizione"".

E ancora:

""Il Pd è politicamente defunto. A quello che leggo oggi sui giornali in interviste di esponenti Pd, non sappiamo neanche se Renzi sarà il candidato premier del centro sinistra. Anzi, secondo le ultime indiscrezioni riportate dai media, a breve ci sarà una direzione del Pd dove il suo ruolo sarà messo in discussione. Il nostro competitor non è più Renzi o il Pd. Combattiamo contro l'indifferenza che genera l'astensione"".

Dunque il Pd – dice Di Maio – è morto. Non è in partita e non è lui il competitor per il voto politico. Effettivamente, se le proiezioni troveranno definitiva conferma, i grillini prendono il doppio dei dem in Sicilia e il Pd è in crisi perché ancora non si trova una squadra a sinistra. C'è isolamento intorno a Renzi e Di Maio prova, dall'esterno, ad aumentare questa frattura, ad allargare il divario e a far esplodere le contraddizioni interne al Partito democratico.

Nelle parole di Di Maio, però, manca la legittimazione nei confronti del logico, nuovo, avversario: il centrodestra. Di Maio scrive su Facebook e proverà ancora a dire che il nemico da battere è ""l'indifferenza che genera l'astensione"", ma il gioco durerà poco.

Ciò che è più probabile è che il centrosinistra subisca un progressivo oscuramento come capitò già al centrodestra in occasione delle passate elezioni amministrative, quelle in cui si imposero i grillini a Roma e Torino e il Pd a Milano. In sostanza per qualche anno, successivo alle elezioni del 2013, soprattutto a causa dall'appannarsi della posizione pubblica di Berlusconi, Renzi fu considerato da larga parte dell'opinione pubblica come il solo argine al grillismo montante.

Se la logica del voto utile si imporrà, suggerendo la dicotomia centrodestra-M5S, allora per Renzi sarà ancora più difficile succhiare voti ad Articolo Uno e la battaglia identitaria di Speranza e Bersani potrà acquistare significato. È presto per dire come finirà ma è di tutta evidenza che il piano si è inclinato e il Pd sta scivolando a vantaggio di Forza Italia.

Di Maio ha colto la palla al balzo, comunicativamente e politicamente, e a causa delle divisioni e delle incertezze che caratterizzano il centrodestra sul piano della leadership, potrà ancora per due mesi evitare qualsivoglia confronto tv.

C'è chi dice che Di Maio ha sbagliato, ma la storia politica è piena di candidati in vantaggio che ritardano o rifiutano sfide televisive con competitor che potrebbero solo guadagnare punti in un match pubblico. Le settimane guadagnate saranno preziose per il giovane candidato pentastellato che però non è nuovo a forfait dell'ultima ora e ora dovrà stare molto attento a non declinare più confronti e interviste scomode.",La mossa intelligente di Di Maio,http://www.huffingtonpost.it/andrea-camaiora/la-mossa-intelligente-di-di-maio_a_23267949/

Nel giorno in cui il tavolo tecnico tra il governo e i sindacati sul tema dell'aumento dell'età pensionabile mette in evidenza le distanze tra le parti, arriva dal segretario generale della Cgil, Susanna Camusso, un nuovo affondo contro il governo. Nel corso di un'audizione in Senato sulla manovra, la numero uno del sindacato di corso d'Italia è perentoria: bisognava ""intervenire prima che scatti l'innalzamento automatico dell'età, con un provvedimento di legge che lo eviti"" e poi avere anche ""uno sguardo verso il futuro"" per facilitare i giovani e le donne.

Il tema dell'aumento dell'età pensionabile, previsto dal 2019 (da 66 anni e 7 mesi a 67 anni), è al centro del confronto tra governo e sindacati, ma il tavolo tecnico, seguito all'incontro politico della settimana scorsa a palazzo Chigi, ha suscitato una reazione negativa da parte dei sindacati. ""L'incontro, come temevamo, è partito in salita. Intanto abbiamo appurato che non c'è la volontà di discutere in questa sede dei temi della 'fase due' della previdenza. E abbiamo appurato che non esistono dati, ricerche, statistiche utili al ragionamento sull'aspettativa di vita in rapporto al lavoro svolto"", ha dichiarato il segretario confederale della Cgil, Roberto Ghiselli, al termine dell'incontro. ""La strada è molto in salita. Il governo non vuole affrontare nell'insieme i temi della fase due sulla previdenza"", relativi in particolare alle donne e ai giovani"", ha sottolineato il segretario confederale della Uil, Domenico Proietti. Meno pessimista la Cisl: ""Abbiamo avuto oggi degli scambi di opinioni e compiuto delle valutazioni: c'è l'impegno del governo a presentare una proposta. È un dato di serietà"", ha dichiarato il segretario generale della Cisl, Gigi Petteni.

Il governo è al lavoro per esonerare i cosiddetti lavori gravosi dallo scalino, ma a Cgil, Cisl e Uil potrebbe non bastare perché chiedono un blocco, generale, dello scatto. Lo stesso esecutivo, attraverso il premier Paolo Gentiloni e il ministro dell'Economia, Pier Carlo Padoan, si era impegnato a rivedere i meccanismi che determinano lo scalino, ma i sindacati ora temono che l'intervento di palazzo Chigi e Tesoro alla fine si limiterà solo all'estensione della platea che sarà esonerata dallo scatto, inglobando circa 15mila nuovi lavoratori.

Chi si schiera contro il blocco dello scalino è Confindustria. ""Apprezzabile che il governo si riuscito finora a respingere le richieste in materia di età pensionabile, che avrebbero un impatto significativo sul deficit pubblico"", ha detto il direttore generale di confindustria, Marcella Panucci.

Il Pd, che aveva presentato alcuni emendamenti alla manovra in Senato per chiedere un rinvio di sei mesi (a giugno 2018 ndr) della decisione sull'aumento dell'età pensionabile, apre alla convergenza con il governo. ""Se serve modificare la norma sull'Ape social, per ricomprendere altri lavori, siamo disponibili"", ha sottolineato il capogruppo Pd in commissione Bilancio, Giorgio Santini.

L'Istat intanto avverte: non basta stabilire le categorie lavorative da escludere dall'automatismo dell'aumento dell'età pensionabile, ma anche il percorso del lavoratore. ""È un tema che si può affrontare ma va studiato sia dal punto di vista della misura da scrivere che della fattibilità a implementarla"", ha spiegato il presidente dell'Istituto nazionale di statistica, Giorgio Alleva. ""Non basta stabilire le categorie - ha osservato il presidente dell'Istat - bisogna anche stabilire se una persona sia stata, per una certa durata della vita lavorativa, in quella posizione. Bisogna valutare anche il percorso lavorativo delle persone"".

La Cgil stronca la manovra: ""Ancora condoni, lo Stato si piega agli evasori""

Le riaperture dei condoni rafforzano l'idea di una amministrazione che, incapace di recuperare quanto non versato, si piega all'evasore incentivando nuova aspettativa di condoni futuri e quindi nuova evasione"". È il j'accuse, contenuto nel documento sulla manovra che la Cgil ha depositato alle commissioni Bilancio di Camera e Senato. Il sindacato si riferisce alla riapertura dei termini della rottamazione delle cartelle contenuta nel decreto fiscale, provvedimento che ""appare più come un milleproroghe"", ""una sorta di manovra minima tra nuove entrate ed esigenze indifferibili"".","""Nella manovra c'è il vuoto pneumatico sulle pensioni, lo scatto va fermato""",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/06/nella-manovra-ce-il-vuoto-pneumatico-sulle-pensioni-lo-scatto-va-fermato_a_23268100/

Even as the government in India has campaigned to save the girl child with its Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana, ground reality has changed little. To this day mothers and girl children continue to be abandoned by families because of the baby's gender.

Amir Taghinia is 24, and until last week he was among the 600 refugees and asylum seekers in the Australian-run centre on Manus Island.

The centre has since been officially closed, with power, water and food cut off in an attempt by local PNG authorities to force residents to move to other nearby accommodation complexes. The United Nations reported last week that at least one of these three new facilities is not finished, while the other two still lack security fences.

We speak with Wayne and Linda, who helped bring former Manus Island detainee, Amir, to Canada. #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/iocGYKtRjS — The Project (@theprojecttv) November 6, 2017

Taghinia was last week flown to Coquitlam, near Vancouver, where he will be resettled under a novel Canadian policy which allows private sponsorship of refugees. He was sponsored by the family of Chelsea Taylor, an Australian aid worker who formerly worked on Manus, who have agreed to aid him for one year. Under the Canadian program, the sponsoring family or organisation takes responsibility for providing food, accommodation and living expenses, assisting with enrolling in healthcare and education, finding local doctors, and helping with employment searches.

""I am glad some good people of Canada have brought me to safety, but my heart aches for the many brothers I have left behind in the absolute hell that is Manus Island,"" Taghinia said.

""That ordinary citizens can bring me to safety, with their meagre resources, shines a light on the shameful practices of this government in keeping these other innocent men trapped in such a terrible situation.

""There are clearly many options the Australian Government has to resettle my friends on Manus, it is inhuman that the Australian Government would not take action to give them safety.""

In an interview with Canada's CBC News, Taghinia said ""I still cannot believe that I am in Canada... People are so welcoming ... they are so lovely, especially my sponsors.""

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that Taghinia's case showed why Australia needed to urgently explore third-country resettlement options for the men on Manus, and decried the Turnbull government's refusal to consider the offer of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to take 150 of the refugees. The ASRC said the Canadian example was ""a precedent it could and should extend to those suffering on Manus and Nauru.""

""Amir's Canadian sponsorship demonstrates clearly that it is entirely possible for third countries to step in and provide a workable solution to the current crisis on Manus,"" said ASRC director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero.

""The Turnbull government must get out of the way. Allow food, water and power to be restored. Allow medical services in and then allow third countries to take the refugees, where they will be welcomed to a new life.""

The ASRC said it was a case of ""PM Turnbull dithers while crisis deepens"". Tim O'Connor, communications director at the Refugee Council of Australia, accused Turnbull of ""playing games with peoples lives"".

""Prime Minister Turnbull is saying 'we don't want these refugees, but you can't have them either',"" O'Connor said.

In einem Interview hat der erfahrene Politiker nun Einblicke in die Vorgänge hinter verschlossenen Türen gegeben

Was Trittin beschreibt, mutet bisweilen bizarr an

Die große Zeit von Jürgen Trittin bei den Grünen schien eigentlich längst vorbei. Nach den Bundestagswahlen 2013 schob sich die Partei immer mehr in die bürgerlich-gemächliche Mitte, Jürgen Trittin blieb eher allein am linken Rand zurück. Einen großen Posten hat der ehemalige Bundesminister nicht mehr inne.

Doch jetzt verhandelt Trittin für seine Partei mit über die mögliche Jamaika-Koalition. Plötzlich ist er wieder wichtig - und laut. Die ""taz"" schrieb unlängst in einem Portrait über Trittin, er sei für Union und FDP - aber auch für manche Parteikollegen, ein U-Boot: ""Sie fragen sich, ob er für Jamaika Geleitschutz gibt oder ob er irgendwann den Torpedo auf den eigenen Tanker feuert.""

Trittins Rolle bei den Grünen, so die Zeitung, sei während der Sondierungsgespräche die des ""diabolisch angehauchten Kotzbrockens, den die Gegenseite fürchtet"". In dieser Weise lässt sich auch ein Interview Trittins mit dem ""Spiegel"" lesen, in dem der Grünen-Politiker Union und FDP attackiert - und einen Einblick in bizarre Vorgänge bei den Jamaika-Verhandlungen gibt.

Trittin: ""Das gleitet schon ins Satirische ab""

Gegenüber dem Magazin betont Trittin die Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen während der Verhandlungen - es seien vielmehr die FDP und besonders die Union, die blockieren würden. Im Fall der CDU spricht der Grüne gar von einer ""Totalblockade"" und ""absurden Streitigkeiten über Begriffe"".

So seien die Gespräche beim Thema Zukunft des Verbrennungsmotors an zwei Wörtern gescheitert: ""Entdatum"" und ""Elektromobilität"". Beide Begriffe habe die CDU nicht in den Papieren haben wollen. Lieber wolle man dort über ""alternative Antriebe"" schreiben.

""Das gleitet schon ins Satirische ab"", echauffiert sich Trittin über solche Wortklaubereien. Nach zwei, drei Stunden Streit hätten die Grünen sich dann einen Spaß erlaubt, und den Koalitionsvertrag von CDU und FDP in Nordrhein-Westfalen herausgeholt. ""Da steht, dass NRW zum Vorreiter bei Elektromobilität werden soll. Plötzlich hat die CDU ihren Widerstand aufgegeben.""

Auch die FDP wird von Trittin deutlich kritisiert

Glaubt man Trittin, sei das größere Hindernis für eine Jamaika-Koalition jedoch vor allem die FDP.

Die habe lieber vier Jahre von rechts Opposition gegen eine Große Koalition machen wollen und käme nun aber nicht aus der Verantwortung. ""Also provozieren sie uns, in der Hoffnung, dass wir Grüne die Reißleine ziehen"", sagt Trittin dem ""Spiegel"", ""dabei unterschätzt die FDP unsere Intelligenz.""

Am Ende läuft es nach Trittins Darstellung bei den Sondierungsgesprächen auf folgende Konstellation hinaus: Schwarz-Gelb blockiert, die Grünen seien bereit für Kompromisse, doch Union und FDP ""sind sich offenbar einig, dass die Grünen möglichst wenig, am besten gar nichts durchsetzen sollen"".

➨ Mehr zum Thema: CSU-Politiker Dobrindt wütet: ""Die Grünen provozieren das Scheitern von Jamaika""

Diese Anspannung führe dann dazu, dass man zwei Stunden über das Wort ""Elektromobilität"" streite. ""Das verschwendet unnütze Lebenszeit und trägt nicht zur Verbesserung der Laune bei"", findet Trittin. ""Aber wenn wir Grüne uns treffen, lachen wir ziemlich viel.""

Gerade Jürgen Trittin hat dafür allen Grund - er ist zurück im Rampenlicht.

Das Thema ist nicht neu. Bereits in den frühen 1960er Jahren gab es seitens der Telefonhersteller Vorzeigeprojekte mit Bildübertragung. Ich selbst habe damals noch keine Erfahrungen mit Bildtelefonie machen können. Es hatte sich aber offenbar nicht durchgesetzt.

Vielleicht liegt es an dem Effekt, den man auch den Telefax-Effekt nennen könnte: Obwohl das Telefax bereits 1843 erfunden war, konnte es sich erst 130 Jahre später wirklich nennenswert verbreiten. Woran lag das? Nun, es gibt keinen Grund, ein Faxgerät zu kaufen, wenn man einer der ersten Teilnehmer an diesem Kommunikationsdienst ist. Schließlich müsste man viel investieren und könnte das Gerät kaum zum Einsatz bringen. So ging es auch dem Telefax: Die Kosten für ein Gerät waren hoch und die Chancen, einen Kommunikationspartner zu finden, gering.

Erst in den 1970er Jahren gelang der Durchbruch des Faxgerätes, wobei vor allem japanische Unternehmen diesen Siegeszug verursachten. Endlich gab es ein Medium, mit dem die komplexen japanischen Schriftzeichen sicher übertragen werden konnten. Der massenhafte Erfolg des Faxgerätes in Japan brachte erschwingliche Preise und schließlich eine weltweite Verbreitung.

Video im Vertrieb - Welche Technik eignet sich?

In unserer Zeit haben fast alle Menschen einen Computer im beruflichen Einsatz. Und mindestens genauso verbreitet sind Smartphones, die hervorragend als Endgeräte für Video-Kommunikation geeignet sind. Die Endgeräte sind also schon vorhanden und deshalb steht der Verbreitung der Video-Kommunikation nichts mehr im Wege - wenn man weiß, wie die Technik funktioniert.

Es gibt sicherlich eine große Anzahl von Systemen, mit denen man eine geeignete Verbindung per Video aufbauen kann. Hier möchte ich mich auf einige wenige beschränken, die aufgrund ihrer Verbreitung erwähnenswert sind.

Skype - eignet es sich für Vertrieb per Video-Kommunikation?

Das Unternehmen Skype ist inzwischen im Microsoft-Konzern aufgegangen. Der Name hat sich vielerorts als Kategorie-Begriff durchgesetzt. „Lass uns skypen"" versteht man als Aufforderung, statt dem Telefon die kostenlose Kommunikation per Internet zu wählen.

Um teilnehmen zu können, benötigt man ein Konto bei Skype und bekommt dann ein „Skype Handle"". Das ist ein eindeutiger Name, der aus zusammenhängenden Buchstaben und Ziffern besteht. Bevor man sich kontaktieren kann, muss man sich gegenseitig autorisieren. Das verhindert SPAM und Missbrauch, ist jedoch für Neulinge mühsam zu verstehen. Vielleicht ein Grund, dass sich Skype nur relativ langsam verbreitet. Inzwischen geht man von etwa 1,3 Milliarden Nutzern weltweit aus.

Kürzlich wurden auch Gruppenkommunikationen mit mehr als zwei Teilnehmern möglich, sodass es jetzt einen wesentlichen Nachteil gegenüber Wettbewerbern ausgleichen konnte.

Google Hangouts ermöglicht Video-Kommunikation in Gruppen

Zehn Jahre nach Skype kam Google mit seinem Video-Kommunikations-Dienst Hangouts auf den Markt. Um ihn zu benutzen, benötigt man lediglich ein Google-Konto.

Darüber hinaus ist der Dienst von Google mit Skype vergleichbar, auch wenn er noch weitere Funktionen bietet, die wir später noch behandeln werden.

Zoom bietet einen Meetingraum für den Vertrieb

Meine bevorzugte Lösung für Video-Kommunikation im Vertrieb ist derzeit zoom.us. Es ist kostenlos, wenn man nur mit einem Gesprächspartner kommunizieren will. Bei mehr als zwei Teilnehmern ist die Gesprächsdauer auf 40 Minuten beschränkt. Die einfachste kostenpflichtige Variante bekommen Sie ab 15 Euro. Dann sind bis zu 100 Teilnehmer möglich.

Der besondere Vorteil: Nur einer der Teilnehmer benötigt ein Konto beim Anbieter. Also können Verkäufer sich ein Konto anlegen. Die anderen Gesprächspartner benötigen nur einen einfachen Link. Wenn man darauf zum ersten Mal klickt, wird automatisch eine Software installiert. Das gilt auch für Smartphones. Dann kann man einfach teilnehmen. Alle Beteiligten können eigenständig ihre Kamera und Mikrofon ein- und ausschalten. Ebenso können alle Teilnehmer ihren Bildschirminhalt übertragenen und so beispielsweise Präsentationen allen andern Teilnehmern zeigen.

Die Video-Meetings können automatisch aufgezeichnet werden. Nach Ende der Video-Konferenz dauert es einen kurzen Moment, dann ist eine Video-Datei verfügbar, die das Gespräch und alle Video-Inhalte enthält. Das kann sehr hilfreich sein, wenn man das Gespräch im Nachgang dem Kunden zur Verfügung stellen möchte.

Sales on Camera - So gelingt Vertrieb per Video

Jeder weiß, was zu tun ist, um zu Telefonieren. Bei der Kommunikation per Video sind die meisten Menschen ungeübt. Deshalb hier einige Ideen, um per Video besser zu verkaufen.

In unseren Tagen ist die Kommunikation per Video - zumindest privat - an der Tagesordnung. Jeder kann irgendwie damit umgehen. Denken wir. Ausgebildete Kameraleute schlagen verzweifelt die Hände über dem Kopf zusammen, wenn Sie so manche Videonachrichten sehen. Das muss aber nicht sein. Hier einige einfache, aber wichtige Informationen.

Perspektive erzeugt Emotionen

Die Kamera entspricht im Videogespräch dem Auge des Betrachters. Wenn Sie über Webcam kommunizieren, ist die Webcam das Auge des Kunden. Achten Sie deshalb darauf, dass die Kamera auf gleicher Höhe zu Ihren Augen ist.

Wenn Sie eine normale Haltung einnehmen und einen Notebook verwenden, ist das Bild Ihrer Bildschirm-Kamera nicht optimal, weil es von unten kommt und Ihr Gesicht verzerrt. Wenn Sie einen Notebook verwenden, sollten Sie ihn deshalb besser auf einen Stapel Bücher stellen.

Noch besser ist eine USB-Kamera, die man auf ein Stativ montieren kann. Dann ist die Höhe sehr gut einstellbar. Augenhöhe ist auch aus psychologischer Sicht wichtig.

Wenn die Kamera zu nah ist, kann Ihr Gesicht verzerrt wirken. Stellen Sie die Kamera lieber etwas weiter weg. Wenn Sie die Variante mit dem Notebook auf dem Bücherstapel wählen, sollten Sie eine zweite Tastatur und eine Maus einplanen.

Hintergrund für Video-Kommunikation

Ein neutraler, weißer Hintergrund ist optimal. Bitte keine auffälligen Bilder im Hintergrund. Ihre Gesprächspartner wären abgelenkt.

Für die Beleuchtung ist es wichtig, dass der Hintergrund ähnlich hell ist, wie Ihr Gesicht im Vordergrund. Ein helles Fenster hinter Ihnen ist ebenso schlecht, wie ein dunkler Raum. Für eine gute Video-Kommunikation sollten Sie gut erkennbar sein und kein besonderer Helligkeitskontrast zum Hintergrund bestehen.

Licht für das Verkaufen per Video

Wenn Sie eine weiche, gleichmäßige Ausleuchtung suchen, ist eine großflächige Beleuchtung mit wenig Abstand ideal. Direkt vor einem Fenster sitzend - mit dem Blick dorthin - haben Sie eine gute Ausleuchtung, wenn das Fenster keine direkte Sonneneinstrahlung hat.

Abends sollten Sie eine Lampe nutzen, die Sie anstrahlt. Je größer die Fläche des Leuchtkörpers ist und je näher am Gesicht, je weicher wird das Licht. Umgekehrt erzeugt weit entferntes Licht mit kleiner Fläche ein hartes Licht, das sehr harte Schatten wirft (beispielsweise ein Halogenstrahler an der Decke).

Ton ist entscheidend, wenn Sie per Video verkaufen

Machen Sie beim Ton keine Kompromisse. Ideal ist eine Kombination aus Kopfhörern und einem Großmembran-Mikrofon. So können Sie mit geringem Abstand zum Mikrofon viele Umgebungsgeräusche ausblenden und Ihre Sprache ohne Hall und Rückkoppelung übermitteln.

Ich selbst nutze das Rode Podcaster, das man einfach an einem USB-Anschluss nutzen kann.

Die nächstbeste Variante ist ein Headset mit Mikrofon, das über USB oder den Kopfhöreranschluss angesteckt wird. Eine Variante über Bluetooth ist nicht so optimal, weil es bei Funkübertragung immer kleine Übertragungsverzögerungen gibt (Fachchinesisch: Latenzen), die dann zu Hall und anderen akustischen Störungen führen können. Bei wichtigen Verkaufsgesprächen per Video würde ich nach heutigem Stand der Technik noch immer ein Mikrofon und Headset mit Kabel nutzen.

Verhaltensregeln für das Verkaufen per Video

Verändern Sie Ihre Sprechweise nicht künstlich und verhalten Sie sich wie am Telefon. Jetzt dürfen Sie zusätzlich noch beachten, dass Sie möglichst immer in die Kamera blickten und nur noch peripher den Rest Ihres Bildschirms sehen. Das gilt zumindest so lange, wie Sie selbst sprechen oder Ihr Kunde spricht. Kurze Unterbrechungen des Augenkontakts sind ok, aber ohne diesen - wenn auch virtuellen - ist es kaum möglich eine Bindung zu erzeugen.

Wenn Sie Husten müssen, oder es kurz laut in Ihrem Umfeld wird, können Sie temporär mit einem Klick Ihr Mikrophon stumm schalten und später wieder aktivieren.

Sie sollten auch darauf achten, dass die Internetverbindung während der Unterhaltung nicht unnötig belastet wird. Dazu können Sie alle Programme beenden, die im Hintergrund das Internet nutzen. Typische Bandbreitenfressen sind: Dropbox, E-Mail und andere Programme, die ohne Ihr Eingreifen Dateien synchronisieren.

Scheitern an der Technik - Wie einfach ist es für den Kunden?

Egal mit welchem System Sie arbeiten wollen - wichtig ist, dass Sie dem unerfahrenen Kunden eine Anleitung zukommen lassen, damit er - ohne sich zu blamieren - an der Video-Konferenz teilnehmen kann. Am besten, Sie finden online eine Anleitung in der passenden Sprache oder Sie schreiben selbst eine.

Wie bereits erwähnt ist Zoom.us meine aktuelle Wahl, weil man als Teilnehmer einfach mit einem Klick auf einen Link teilnehmen kann. Aber auch hier gibt es Hürden: Manche Unternehmen blockieren aus Sicherheitsgründen das Installieren von zusätzlicher Software auf den firmeneigenen Notebooks. Daran kann auch eine Video-Kommunikation mit Zoom scheitern. Am besten Sie geben dem Kunden die Gelegenheit, es vorher zu testen.

Auch für Skype und Hangouts kann es Blockaden geben, weil manche Unternehmen Streaming generell aus dem Unternehmensnetz verbannt haben.

Eine Alternative wäre die Nutzung eines Smartphones. Alle genannten Dienste bieten jeweils eine App für iOS und Android an, mit der man einfach teilnehmen kann. Allerdings muss auch diese erst einmal geladen werden.

Wenn alle Stricke reißen, wäre auch eine Einwahl per klassischem Telefon möglich. Wegen des dann fehlenden Bildkanals wäre das ein Rückschritt. Aber wenn ein einzelner Teilnehmer dabei sein will, im Moment jedoch auf Reisen ist und nur so teilnehmen kann, ist das ein akzeptabler Kompromiss.

Inhalte präsentieren - Verkaufen per Video-Kommunikation

Alle hier genannten Dienste bieten die Möglichkeit, Bildschirminhalte zu übertragen. Auf diese Weise können Sie Präsentationen mit Powerpoint & Co. leicht vorbereiten und Ihren Teilnehmern zeigen. Auch andere Inhalte Ihres Bildschirms können auf diese Weise mit einer Gruppe besprochen werden.

Weil beispielsweise bei Zoom daraus automatisch eine Aufzeichnung entsteht, die man herunterladen und ggf. weiterbearbeiten kann, ist es auf diese Weise sehr einfach, einmal durchgeführte Präsentationen ganz oder teilweise auch Dritten zur Verfügung zu stellen.

Verkaufen per Video - Ihre Botschaft geht um die Welt

Google Hangouts bietet mit der Option „on Air"" eine Möglichkeit an, die Inhalte der Video-Botschaft sofort an eine breite Öffentlichkeit auszustrahlen. Gleiches bietet auch Facebook Live. Beide Varianten lassen es auch zu, dass der Teilnehmerkreis beschränkt wird, beispielsweise so, dass nur die Mitglieder einer bestimmten Facebook-Gruppe die Inhalte sehen können. Wenn Sie Erfahrung mit Messen, Roadshows und Konferenzen als Werkzeug für Vertrieb und Marketing gemacht haben, können Sie diese Technik nutzen, um zusätzliche Teilnehmer hinzuzufügen, die live nicht teilnehmen können. Sie müssten lediglich diese Möglichkeit zur Teilnahme ankündigen und vor Ort die Technik dafür schaffen. Für geringe Zusatzkosten können Sie so eine ganze Menge mehr Teilnehmer einbinden.

Video als Werkzeug für den Vertrieb

Wir dürfen die neuen Möglichkeiten nutzen, um dort, wo es sinnvoll ist, das Telefon abzulösen und vielleicht sogar Geschäftsreisen zu ersetzen. Gegenüber dem Telefon können wir sicher die Wirkung der Kommunikation verbessern. Und dort, wo man Geschäftsreisen einsparen kann, werden nicht nur Kosten gespart, sondern vor allem die unproduktiven Reisezeiten verringert. Auch wenn der direkte persönliche Kontakt sicher besser ist, kann man so die ein oder andere Reise durch eine professionell gemachte Video-Konferenz ersetzen.

El futbol es un deporte que provoca una cascada de sentimientos que cuando son cuestionados, a veces ni sabemos qué contestar. Es pasión, amor, desilusión, frustración y enojo. Es tantas cosas que no hay nada más bonito en el mundo que sentarte en la sala y ver un buen partido en domingo, con una chela y unas papitas para botanear.

Algo que a veces no soporto del futbol masculino mundial es que cada vez se ve más displicencia y condescendencia con respecto al juego, simulaciones de faltas y ganas de engañar al árbitro, así como muchos jugadores que no sudan la camiseta.

Mientras el amor que tenía por este deporte se difuminaba, estas pasadas vacaciones tuve la oportunidad de seguir la Eurocopa femenil de fútbol en Holanda... y me pregunté por qué no lo había descubierto antes: unas ganas y actitud de esfuerzo por parte de las futbolistas inigualable. Más fuertes, duras y toscas en las faltas e incluso los partidos son más agradables por la mentalidad de ""ganar"" por parte de todas. En el futbol femenil los partidos son mucho más emocionantes y dinámicos (con decirles que la final quedó 4-2) que muchos de su contraparte masculina.

Este resumen de la final de la Euro entre Holanda y Dinamarca les puede dar una idea de lo apasionantes que se vuelven estos duelos:

Ya que la competición futbolística se está expandiendo en muchos lugares para las mujeres, y con el inicio de la Liga MX femenil en nuestro país apenas el pasado 28 de julio, les traigo a tres de las futbolistas que (aparte de poseer una calidad impresionante en el terreno de juego) tuvieron que superar adversidades que muchos hombres nunca se van a tener que enfrentar, solo por el hecho de ser mujeres:

Nadia Nadim

La danesa Nadia Nadim celebra luego de anotar el primer gol de la final de la Eurocopa Femenil 2017 disputada entre Holanda y Dinamarca el 6 de agosto del 2017.

Una de cinco hermanas, la danesa adoptiva Nadia Nadim tuvo que escapar de su país natal, Afganistán, luego de que su padre fuese asesinado por los talibanes. Ella cuenta que sus padre fue citado por los talibanes (parte del Emirato Islámico de Afganistán) y que nunca regresó, pero que seis meses después su madre descubrió que fue llevado al desierto y ejecutado.

La vida para seis mujeres en un país en esta guerra, provocada por un grupo que se caracteriza por tratar a la mujer más como un objeto que como un ser humano, era prácticamente imposible.

Ella misma dijo que si se hubiera quedado ahí probablemente se hubiera suicidado por ser muy independiente como para conformarse en una sociedad tan represiva.

Luego su madre invirtió todos sus ahorros con el objetivo de escapar, así consiguieron refugiarse en Italia con pasaportes falsos. Posteriormente se subieron a un autobús que se suponía iría a Londres (donde la familia de Nadia tenía familia), pero el bus se detuvo, los sacaron, le preguntaron a un transeúnte en donde estaban y descubrieron que se encontraban en las zonas rurales de Dinamarca.

Los enviaron a un centro de refugiados y Nadia finalmente pudo jugar al balón sin sufrir ningún prejuicio cultural o social, por lo que decidió competir por la nación que no reprimía su gusto por el balompié.

Ahora, a sus 29 años, la delantera se ha convertido en una de las jugadoras más determinantes de su equipo, logrando llevar a su selección a la final de la última Eurocopa y llegando a anotar 22 goles para su país adoptivo.

Charlyn Corral

Charlyn Corral celebra el gol que le hizo en tiempo extra a Trinidad y Tobago en el Premundial Femenino de CONCACAF por el tercer lugar el 26 de octubre del 2014.

La delantera mexicana de 26 años, autodenominada la Cinco Copas del futbol femenil, nació en cuna futbolera. Ella relata que su padre era el que armaba las retas en su barrio, por lo que desde temprana edad pudo entrenar y llegó a su primer club, Pumitas.

Sin embargo, los sacrificios se hacen evidentes para cualquier familia mexicana de clase media para abajo, por lo que tenía que salir (desde los diez años) entre cinco y seis de la mañana todos los fines de semana a jugar partidos, ya que empezaban a entrenar desde las 8 de la mañana.

Charlyn dudó en continuar con su carrera futbolística antes de la operación que le realizaron cuando se le diagnóstico sindrome compartimental en los chamorros.

Los problemas económicos para cualquier jugadora se intensifican cuando el aspecto laboral y salarial del futbol femenil en México no están definidos... y se juntan con la economía mexicana en crisis casi permanente. Por lo que para ella todo es claro: ""Todas las jugadoras que estamos en selección, en algún momento tuvimos que invertir en camiones, uniformes. Por eso muchas nos vamos al extranjero, porque si no ganas, tampoco vas a gastar"".

También ha sufrido de momentos críticos en su vida, como cuando incluso pensó en retirarse luego de que se le diagnosticara sindrome compartimental en los chamorros, antes de la operación dudó en continuar con su carrera futbolística.

No obstante, la no. 9 mexicana superó esa lesión y actualmente milita en el Levante de España donde da cátedra sobre lo que es una verdadera atacante, que no solo vislumbra por su calidad sino también por su entrega. Les dejo una recopilación de sus mejores goles en el Levante:

Considerada como la mejor futbolista de la historia por sus cinco balones de oro consecutivos (entre 2006 y 2010) la brasileña Marta Vieira sufrió la desigualdad de género en su país y las dificultades que se encontró por vivir en una sociedad sexista. Ella explica que desde su infancia sus hermanos la perseguían para que nadie viera a una mujer jugando este deporte, el cual solo podían jugar los hombres en Dois Riachos (ciudad donde ella creció).

Incluso sus propios padres se avergonzaban de ella por todos los comentarios sexistas que recibían de sus vecinos.

Ella incluso mencionó que su familia deseaba otra cosa: ""Querían que jugara a las muñecas o que hiciera algo para volver al mundo femenino"".

Imagínense que tanto talento y calidad se habrían perdido si le hubiera hecho caso a sus padres...

Ya con 14 años salió de su pueblo y fue a Río de Janeiro para poder cumplir su sueño: jugar con el Vasco de Gama. Su origen no solo era sexista, también humilde. Y con la meta en su mente logró recorrer en autobús los 2 mil kilómetros que hay entre Dois Riachos hasta Río (para que se den una idea el recorrido de la CDMX a Acapulco son 378 km en carretera).

Ahora, la 10 de la Canarinha es la jugadora que más anotaciones ha clavado en un Mundial con 15, ha sido campeona de la liga de Suecia en seis oportunidades y dos ocasiones de la Liga de Estados Unidos.

Sin embargo, aunque fue llamada por el CEO de equipo Orlando Pride como ""la mejor futbolista de la historia"", la desigualdad de género en el fútbol femenil es visible en los temas salariales. En el Rösengard (antiguo equipo de Marta) ganaba aproximadamente 500 mil dólares ya contando salario, primas y patrocinios, pero su contraparte masculina en la selección nacional, Cristiano Ronaldo, por ejemplo, de puro sueldo con el Real Madrid gana 50 millones de dólares al año.

Y por último, para continuar quitando prejuicios que se tienen del futbol femenil, les dejo una recopilación que hizo el canal ""Teo CRi"" en YouTube de las mejores habilidades, dribles, regates, goles y asistencias en el futbol femenino mundial. Se darán cuenta que algunas son incluso mejores que en sus contrapartes masculinas:

BHOPAL -- Five days after the gangrape of a 19-year-old college student in Bhopal, the Madhya Pradesh government has transferred two senior officers including Inspector General of Police (IG).

Bhopal IG, Yogesh Choudhary, has been moved to the police headquarters.

Railway police official, Anita Malviya, who had faced strong criticism for allegedly being insensitive during the handling of the case, has also been transferred.

When asked by media persons, she was seen laughing and reportedly said that she had a ""headache talking about case again and again"". After the video of conversation went viral, there was anger among citizens, which was reflected on social media as well.

Malviya, a state police service (SPS) officer, was posted as superintendent of Railway Police. The GRP police station was directly under her supervision. The GRP too had refused to register an FIR initially.

This is the first action that has been taken against senior officials. Till now mostly the lower rank officials including three SHOs apart and a middle-level official had faced action.

The international development secretary has also been reprimanded by Downing Street for her actions.
The BBC was the first to report on Friday that Patel had undisclosed meetings.

The international development secretary has also been reprimanded by Downing Street for her actions.

Labour said Patel must either be investigated by the Cabinet Office or resign.

Patel was accompanied to nearly all of her meetings with Israeli ministers, charities and non-governmental organisations by honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel lobbying group, Lord Polak.

She apologised for setting up and reporting the meetings “in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures” and clarified her claim that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson “knew about the visit”, admitting he did not know about it in advance.

The BBC was the first to report on Friday that Patel had undisclosed meetings.

Patel said in a statement on Monday: “This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself.

“While away, I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations. I am publishing a list of who I met.‎ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was aware of my visit while it was under way‎.

“In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be misread, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it.

“My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world’s poor at the front of our development work.”

Downing Street said Theresa May had spoken to Patel and “accepted her apology for her handling of the matter”.

“The prime minister met the secretary of state this morning to remind her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code,” a No.10 spokesman said.

Downing Street also revealed May did not know about the meeting between Patel and Netanyahu until Friday.

Kate Osamor MP, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said: “Today’s statement is a desperate last-ditch attempt by Priti Patel to save her job. It has now emerged that, contrary to her statement on Friday, the Foreign Secretary was never told in advance about her meetings in Israel - which we have only now discovered included meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and with the Foreign Ministry.

“Not only does it look like she might have breached the Ministerial Code, she has now been caught misleading the British public. If she doesn’t now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation.”

Dfid has admitted that the statement Patel gave to The Guardian on November 3 could have left given the impression Johnson knew about her trip in advance.

“Boris knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip],” she told the newspaper.

However Patel today admitted the foreign secretary “became aware of the visit” but “not in advance of it”.

Dfid also had to acknowledge that Patel may have led people to believe all the meetings she had in Israel had already been publically reported - when they had not.

“The Secretary of State regrets the lack of precision in the wording she used in these statements, and is taking this opportunity to clarify the position,” Dfid said.

'파라다이스 페이퍼스'



What are the Paradise Papers? - The Guardian

이같은 사실은 5일(현지시각) 공개된 '파라다이스 페이퍼(Paradise Papers)'로 세상에 모습을 드러냈다. 1300만개가 넘는 파일로 이뤄진 이 방대한 유출 문건에는 세계 유명 인사와 기업들이 해외 조세피난처와 다국적 기업 등을 활용해 조세를 회피해 온 정황이 자세하게 담겨있다. 지난해 4월 공개됐던 '파나마 페이퍼스'와 유사하다.

유출된 문서 대부분은 버뮤다에 위치한 법률 자문회사 '애플비(Appleby)'에서 나왔다. 애플비는 전세계 조세도피처에 사무실을 두고 고객들에게 페이퍼컴퍼티 설립 등을 통한 조세 회피, 재산 은닉 등을 자문해왔다.

지난해 '파나마 페이퍼스'에 이어 이번에도 문건을 입수한 독일 일간지 '쥐트도이체차이퉁'은 국제탐사보도언론인협회(ICIJ)에 도움을 요청했다. 이에 따라 미국 뉴욕타임스, 영국 가디언, BBC 등 전 세계 언론사(67개국, 96개 언론사, 382명)들의 국제 공조 취재로 그 내용이 드러나게 됐다. 한국에서는 뉴스타파가 이 작업에 참여했다.

""지난 6개월 동안 방대한 데이터를 일일이 분석했다""는 뉴스타파에 따르면, 유출된 자료는 1950년~2016년 기간에 생산된 1343만여건(1.4TB)에 달한다.

물론 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루됐다는 것만으로 모두 '불법'이라고 단정할 수는 없다. 다만 통상 세금을 회피하기 위한 목적임이 분명한 경우가 많고 '검은 거래'를 숨기려는 의도로 조세회피처를 활용하는 사례가 상당하다. 도덕적 책임은 물론, 때에 따라서는 법적 책임을 피할 수 없게 될 가능성도 있다는 뜻이다.





등장인물들

각 언론사들은 분석 결과를 바탕으로 자료에 담긴 내용들을 보도하고 있다. 이 중 현재까지 주목할 만한 내용 중 하나는 바로 영국 여왕 엘리자베스 2세의 조세회피 의혹이다. 이전에는 한 번도 알려지지 않았던 내용이다.

가디언에 따르면, 엘리자베스 여왕은 캐이맨제도와 버뮤다에 개인 자산 약 1000만파운드(약 145억원)를 역외 투자 형태로 보관중인 것으로 나타났다.

이 과정에는 여왕의 자산을 관리하는 '랭커스터공국(Duchy of Lancaster·DL)'이 동원됐다. DL은 영국 최대 가전·생활용품 임대 전문 소매점 '브라이트하우스' 등에 펀드 형태로 투자를 하고 있는 것으로 나타났다.

왕실 측은 이같은 투자로 세금을 회피한 사실이 없다고 해명했다. 그러나 가디언은 왕실의 재정 운영 상황을 보다 투명하게 공개하라는 요구가 다시 빗발칠 가능성이 높다고 전했다.

쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리도 간접적으로 등장한다. 정치자금 모금을 담당한 최측근인 스티븐 브론프맨이 가족 투자기업을 통해 캐이맨제도와 이스라엘, 미국 등에 복잡한 법인 거래 관계를 설립해뒀다는 것. 가디언은 이 법인들 사이의 거래를 통해 그가 '합법적'으로 세금을 회피했을 가능성이 있다고 전했다.

윌버 로스 미국 상무장관 등 트럼프 정부 고위 관계자들의 이름도 다수 등장한다. 특히 로스 장관은 푸틴의 사위인 키릴 샤말로프와 러시아 기업인들이 공동으로 소유한 에너지기업 '시부르'와 계약을 맺었던 것으로 드러났다. 여기에는 미국 정부가 제재 대상으로 분류한 이들도 포함되어 있다.

그밖에도 U2의 보노가 몰타를 경유해 리투아니아의 대형 쇼핑몰을 비밀리에 소유하고 있던 사실 등이 드러났다.

한편 뉴스타파는 ""현재까지 한국인 232명의 이름을 찾아냈다""고 전했다. 또 ""이들 한국인이 조세도피처에 세운 법인은 모두 90개로 나타났""으며, ""코스닥 상장기업같은 중견업체부터 가스공사같은 공기업, 그리고 재벌기업도 적지 않게 발견됐다""고 덧붙였다.

Kevin Spacey has reportedly been dropped by both his publicist and talent agency, after multiple came forward to accuse him of varying levels of sexual harassment.

Accusations against Spacey were made public earlier this week, when actor Anthony Rapp described an alleged incident which transpired between the two of them when he was just 14 years old.

Spacey responded to the allegations in a statement on his Twitter page, in which he admitted he didn’t recall the events described, but offered his “sincerest apologies” for “what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”.

He also came under fire for taking this moment to publicly acknowledge that he was “choosing to live his life as a gay man”, which was perceived by some prominent figures in the LGBT+ community as a way of “deflecting” from the accusations.

Struggling against an orgy of shouting, clapping, and singing, the solemn weight of history dissolves in the deep shadows of the Gol Gumbaz. A royal tomb, the Gumbaz is sublimely grave in a way only maqbaras can be. Yet, after half a millennium it is also the sanctuary of a motley public. Despite its sepia magnificence, it is reinvented daily and is many things and places simultaneously.

And why not? Buildings, after all, do have a life of their own. They breathe and suffer, and are reborn with the communities who live in and around them. They change with the people who come to them as much, perhaps, as people are changed by their experiences of them. This infusion of character is constant and dynamic, and so the original creative intent becomes one amongst an unending matrix of meanings which emerge from brick and mortar.

This flux characterises Bijapur, a palimpsest notable for the legacies of the monumental Adil Shahs. The long shadows of memory and the tangible history of built form make the boundaries of past and present sfumato with constant use. From the Baran Kaman to the Taj Bauri, from Ibrahim Rauza to Gagan Mahal, the past speaks in Bijapur. It whispers of ambition, the seductions of power strange and terrible, desire and aspiration immortalised in stone. Born of vanity and vision, it symbolises a fusion of form, time, and space not only in terms of what was but also of what can be.

How do we imagine — spatially, economically, and affectively — the contours of such a fusion though? Who belongs to a city, and to whom do its edifices, not just its monuments but also buildings and infrastructure, belong? The law shelters the business of conservation from the commerce and traffic of daily life. Our conservation apparatus seems designed to institute alienation, and rarely does a neighbourhood, community, or people claim trusteeship over a building. We care about our homes, the houses we live in, but find it difficult to think of our cities as home, to care for the songs and shadows they surround us with.

The personal, therefore, is exiled from the communal, and the voice of memory and affect is unable to find a niche under the arch of history. In turning deaf to these voices, in seeing our past not as vibrantly alive but as delicately dead, we perform a grave disservice to our future. The Jami Masjid in Bijapur, for example, belongs both to the community of worshipers, as to the conservation apparatus which serves to memorialise it as a beacon of dakhini architecture. These meanings are not necessarily contrary, but that they often can be is a story local not just to Bijapur but to scores of cities across the subcontinent.

What is needed, then, is a marriage of interpretations and practice. Writing in 1889, Henry Cousens, then Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey of India (Western Circle), related that 'Bijapur has been called the Palmyra of the Dekhan'. In almost a century since, as the Palmyra lies devastated, the built legacy of Bijapur is at risk of an oblivion given the splintering of civic belonging and urban development. The manifold significance of the past is often in its ability to overwhelm, to instil a reverential awe which prompts interrogation and introspection. As we cloister these works and stories of our ancestors behind higher walls and turn blindly towards the future, we risk becoming harsher, meaner, and poorer.

Our heritage belongs to all of us. We cannot privilege one meaning and practice, without irrevocably losing the layered richness which grounds us organically to our communities and cities. The processes of use and interpretation have to be contextual, and it is through constant conversation alone that this erosion can be checked. How, for instance, do we make Taj Bauri relevant to the potable needs of residents without losing sight of the public generosity which informed its making? How do we reinvent Gol Gumbaz as a rendezvous point for a citizenry starved of safe public spaces? Can Baran Kaman become the breathing emblem of ambition which soars, and fails, and yet lives? The challenge at hand is to birth a future which sustains as much from the past as it loops back to it, where growth will aspire to be not from but with a common legacy. This challenge is monumental in itself, for it is not specific to Bijapur. It is ours, a shared task: it is a challenge to make the past one with the future.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.
Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.","Seit nunmehr fast sieben Jahren hat P. einen Rechtsanspruch gegen das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis auf zusätzliche Kosten der Unterkunft in Höhe von 580,80 € (12 x 48,40 €), die er aus seinen existenzsichernden Leistungen im Jahr 2010 vorgeleistet hat. Angeblich sei seine Wohnung in Iserlohn zu teuer für das Jobcenter. So hieß es damals.

Eine Gesetzesänderung in den Wohnraumnutzungsbestimmungen (WNB) NRW zum 01.01.2010 begünstigte Sozialleistungsbezieher dahingehend, dass fortan Wohnungen bis 50 m² als angemessen zu gelten hätten.

Davor waren es nur 45 m². Bereits die Differenz von 5 m² machten eine Entschädigungssumme von monatlich 25,05 € aus.

""Alleinstehende Bezieher von Hartz-IV-Leistungen haben in NRW Anspruch auf 50 qm Wohnfläche"" bestätigte das Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen (LSG NRW) in einem Urteil vom 16.5.2011 (L 19 AS 2202/10).

Das Ministerium für Arbeit, Integration und Soziales (MAIS) reagierte in einem Erlass vom 15.08.2012. Auch die Geschäftsführung des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis wurde über die veränderte Rechtslage in Kenntnis gesetzt und zur Korrektur bestandskräftiger Leistungsbescheide von Amts wegen verpflichtet.

In dem Erlass heißt es unmissverständlich:

""II. Von Amts wegen sind bestandskräftige Leistungsbescheide nach § 22 SGB II mit Wirkung für die Vergangenheit nach § 44 SGB X iVm. § 40 SGB II zurückzunehmen, wenn die Rechte der Leistungsberechtigten infolge der Nichtanwendung der ab dem 01 .01.2010 geltenden WNB betroffen und Leistungen nach § 22 SGB II zu Unrecht nicht erbracht worden sind. Ggf. reicht die Rückwirkung in der Regel bis zum 01.01.2011.""

Mittels Überprüfungsantrag gem. § 44 SGB X hatte P. Vorsorge getroffen, dass auch für das Jahr 2010 keine bestandskräftigen Leistungsbescheide vorliegen. Damit erweiterte sich sein Rechtsanspruch automatisch um ein Jahr.

Dazu kam noch die Tatsache, dass das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis über kein „schlüssiges Konzept"" für die Ermittlung der Kosten der Unterkunft verfügte. (Auch das aktuelle Konzept der Firma Analyse & Konzepte ist derzeit noch beim LSG (L 6 AS 120/17) anhängig.)

Bereits die Weisung MAIS war eine Rechtsverletzung in der Absicht der Vermögensschädigung für Tausende von Betroffenen im Jahr 2010.

In den Mühlen der Rechtsverdreher - Jobcenter verweigert Erstattung

Existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen gibt es anscheinend nur auf dem Klageweg.

In der Zeit vom 08.07.2011 bis zum 26.11.2013 führte P. zwei KDU-Klagen vor dem Sozialgericht in Dortmund. In dieser Zeit wechselten dreimal die zuständigen Richter.

Zuletzt musste das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis den erfolgreichen Rechtsanwalt und für die Bewilligungszeiträume vom 01.08.2011-31.01.2012 (S 19 AS 4056/11; W 578/11) und vom 01.02.2012-31.07.2012 (S 19 AS 308/12, W 83/12) 12 x 48,40 € = 580,80 € bezahlen.

Trotz ministerialer Weisung vom 15.08.2012 verweigerte das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis Jahre lang die von Amts wegen angeordnete Erstattung von Januar 2011 bis Juli 2011, also weitere 7 Monate á 48,40 € = 338,80 €.

Am Donnerstag, den 17.07.2014 wurde ein weiteres Hauptsacheverfahren über die Nachzahlung der KDU für das Jahr 2010 im Sozialgericht Dortmund unter Vorsitz der Richterin Sülow verhandelt. Dabei ging es um den Beweis des fristgerechten Zugangs zweier Überprüfungsanträge.

Als Behördenvertreterin des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis behauptete die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch. im Termin ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"". Diese Behauptung wurde ohne jeden belastbaren Beweis vorgetragen und völlig anhaltslos geglaubt.

Richterin Sülow schenkte der unbewiesenen Aussage mehr Glauben als dem Verfasser als Faxversender, obwohl nachweislich drei gesendete Faxe mit Datum, Uhrzeit und Nummer des Jobcenters an das Jobcenter Iserlohn gesandt worden waren.

Untätigkeitsklage trotz unstritigem Rechtsanspruch

Mit dieser Entwicklung hatte niemand gerechnet. 580,80 € verloren, weil die Jobcenter-Mitarbeiterin behauptete ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"".

Im Urteil des Sozialgericht Dortmund vom 17.07.2014 (S 19 AS 357/12) heißt es:

""Zur Begründung führt sie aus, ein Überprüfungsantrag vom 14.06.2011 sei dort weder bekannt noch zugegangen. Empfangsjournale des Faxgerätes mit der Nummer 02371/905799 für den 14.06.2011 seien bei dem Beklagten nicht mehr vorhanden.""

Damit wurde die Untätigkeitsklage für den Zeitraum 01.01.2010 bis 30.06.2011 über 48,40 € monatlich und damit insgesamt 871,20 Euro Existenzsichernde Leistungen abgewiesen, obwohl der Rechtsanspruch auf der Grundlage des WNB NRW unstrittig ist.

Spätere Recherchen zeichnen die Vorgänge jedoch klarer: Die Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags erfolgte durch die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch., die nicht einmal in dem Gebäude Friedrichstraße 59/61, sondern in der Brausestraße arbeitet, in dem das entsprechende Faxgerät steht.

Außerdem war wohl zum Zeitpunkt des Faxzugangs (21:37 Uhr) niemand mehr im Gebäude. Ob die betreffende Beklagtenvertreterin überhaupt nur einmal einen Faxeingang in der Hauptzentrale miterlebt hat? Von der Erfassung im ""Eingangsbuch"" ganz zu schweigen.

Als sicher gelten darf aber, dass die Reinigungskräfte das Büro häufiger betreten als die Wortführende ""Zeugin"" mit ihrer Behauptung.

Auch die Zeit der Faxübertragung, Dienstag, 14.06.2011 um 21:37 Uhr, lässt die Aussage der Jobcentervertreterin unglaubwürdig erscheinen.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.

Diese Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags wertete die Vorsitzende Richterin höher als die Aussage der Person, die das Fax versendet, die ordnungsgemäße Übertragung überprüft hat, die Eintragung der Übersendung eigens dokumentiert hat und anschließend den Überprüfungsantrag in den entsprechenden Ordner einlegt hat.

Berufungsverfahren bei Landessozialgericht in Essen

Am 03.04.2015 wurde eine Berufungsverhandlung beim LSG NRW verhandelt. Die Richter stellten auch einen gravierenden Rechtsverstoß in der Bescheidbearbeitung fest, was zu einer weiteren Nachzahlung von 338,80 € für die Zeit vom 01.01.2011-31.07.2011 führte, wollten aber keine Nachzahlung für das Jahr 2010 entscheiden.

Noch immer sind 580,80 € offen.

Und noch eine weitere Klagerunde

Nachdem weder das SG Dortmund noch das LSG NRW vollständig Abhilfe schaffen wollten, wurde ein drittes Mal in gleicher Sache der Rechtsweg über eine juristische Hintertür beschritten.



Am 01.07.2015 wurden zwei Überprüfungsanträge wegen der Ablehnungsbescheide vom 03.04.2012 & 16.04.2012 per Fax an je drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis (Fax: 02371 905-799; 905-848; 905-859) gesandt.

Um postalische Eingangsbestätigung der Überprüfungsanträge wurde ausdrücklich gebeten.

Am 03.08.2015, 31.08.2015, 05.10.2015, 28.10.2015, 30.11.2015 und 31.12.2015 erfolgten Erinnerungen. Zwei Faxe an jeweils drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis. - Ganz wie beim ersten Mal!

Siebenmal Sechs Fax-Anträge. Bei keinem der 42 Anträge erfolgte auch nur ein Bescheid. Nicht einmal eine Eingangsbestätigung. Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.

Inzwischen ist eine weitere Untätigkeitsklage (Az.: S 14 AS 1515/16) anhängig und die Überprüfungsanträge sind aus der Akte verschwunden.

Wer nicht klagt, bekommt auch nichts - so die erschreckende Erfahrung vieler Leistungsberechtigter.

Die Statistik der BA „Widersprüche und Klagen SGB II - September 2017 listet 407 Jobcenter auf und weist für das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis einen Bestand von 1714 anhängigen Klagen aus, das sind 10% bei 17.149 Bedarfsgemeinschaften (nur 41 Jobcenter verwalten mehr BG's; 50 Jobcenter haben mehr Klagen anhängig)

C'est tout du moins ce qu'a laissé entendre Tony Estanguet, le Président du Comité d'Organisation lors d'une interview:

""Nous devons nous pencher sur la question car nous ne pouvons pas dire 'non, ça ne nous regarde pas, ça n'a rien à voir avec les JO'. La jeunesse est intéressée par l'e-sport et ce genre de pratiques. Nous devons y prêter attention. Nous devons les rencontrer et voir si nous pouvons tisser des liens. Je ne veux pas dire 'non' dès le début. Je pense qu'il est intéressant d'interagir avec le Comité Olympique International, avec les joueurs, avec la famille de l'e-sport, pour mieux comprendre comment cela fonctionne et pourquoi c'est un tel succès.""

Depuis cette déclaration, les grands acteurs du sport mais aussi du milieu des jeux vidéo y vont de leur opinion sur la question et les avis sont partagés chez les sportifs comme chez les joueurs. J'ai d'ailleurs compilé les déclarations de quelques acteurs majeurs de l'e-sport français que vous pourrez trouver sur le blog Gamezine.fr

En tant que passionné d'e-sport et amateur de sport traditionnel, je suis fermement convaincu que la représentation des jeux vidéo compétitifs aux Jeux Olympiques de Paris est concevable. Plus que ça, je pense même que les jeux vidéo ont tout à fait leur place dans la compétition sportive la plus prestigieuse au monde!

L'e-sport est-il un sport?

Il faut avouer que la frontière du sport est vague: l'effort physique est-il une composante indispensable pour qu'une activité puisse être appelée ""sport""? Et si cette question n'avait finalement pas tellement d'importance?

Le tir à l'arc, le tir à la carabine, le golf ou encore le curling sont bien représentés aux Jeux Olympiques. Et de nouvelles activités peu physiques pourraient rejoindre la liste puisque la pétanque et le billard ont aussi candidats pour une intégration aux JO de Paris.

L'e-sport est très similaire aux sports évoqués ci-dessus si l'on se penche uniquement sur les aptitudes qui permettent aux athlètes de performer au plus haut niveau: de l'adresse, un esprit d'analyse, une stratégie efficace et même des réflexes et un solide esprit d'équipe pour certains titres.

Le symbole d'une nouvelle génération de compétiteurs

L'e-sport est loin d'être un effet de mode récent et passager. Si les médias ne s'y intéressent que depuis quelques années avec l'explosion de l'audience et des cash prizes de jeux comme League of Legends, Dota2 ou CS:GO, les jeux vidéo compétitifs sont pratiqués activement depuis près de 20 ans.

Aujourd'hui, si les jeux vidéo ont encore mauvaise réputation aux yeux du grand public, ils sont devenus un support de loisir et de compétition incontournable pour une grande partie de la population, notamment les 15-25 ans. Comme l'a indiqué Tony Estanguet dans son interview, l'e-sport a aujourd'hui trop d'ampleur pour être simplement ignoré... et l'évolution de cette discipline n'est pas prête de s'arrêter!

Les Jeux Olympiques ont cette image de graal ultime pour tout compétiteur: la plus prestigieuse des compétitions de sport au monde. C'est donc tout naturellement que la possibilité de voir de l'e-sport aux JO remplit d'étoiles les yeux de nombreux passionnés.

Un message important à passer

Alors que notre société est plus sédentaire que jamais, le Jeux Olympiques promeuvent le sport et ses bienfaits pour la santé. Les jeux vidéo quant à eux sont au contraire l'un des symboles de cette sédentarité poussée à ses extrêmes et néfaste pour notre santé.

Cette opposition entre jeux vidéo et bonne santé doit-elle empêcher l'e-sport d'intégrer les Jeux Olympiques? Surtout pas, au contraire!

Certains éditeurs de jeux vidéo, à l'image de Riot Games et son célèbre jeu League of Legends, tentent au fil du temps de mettre en avant l'importance de l'activité physique dans la vie d'un joueur. Au travers de différents spots publicitaires et documentaires sur les joueurs professionnels, la société américaine vante les vertus d'une activité physique sur les performances en jeu. Le dicton ""un esprit sain dans un corps sain"" s'applique parfaitement à l'e-sport.

Intégrer l'e-sport aux Jeux Olympiques serait un pas de géant pour mettre une bonne fois pour toute l'accent sur l'importance de l'activité physique dans la vie d'un joueur de jeux vidéo. La mise en avant de l'exercice physique auprès des communautés les plus sédentaires est une mission d'intérêt général et les Jeux Olympiques sont la compétition idéale pour avancer sur le sujet.

Réconcilier le grand public avec les jeux vidéo

L'image négative que transporte les jeux vidéo aux yeux du grand public (français tout du moins) est loin de s'être totalement résorbée au fil des années. Demandez à une personne âgée ce qu'elle pense des joueurs d'échecs et des joueurs de jeux vidéo. Elle aura souvent une image radicalement différente des deux disciplines alors qu'elles ont de nombreuses similitudes: pas d'activité physique intense, une grande demande de concentration, d'analyse et de stratégie (tous les jeux ne demandent évidemment pas ces mêmes aptitudes). Non, les faits divers alarmants sur les excès d'une poignée de joueurs ne sont pas représentatifs de l'ensemble de la communauté!

Et si on montrait au monde les jeux vidéo comme une activité compétitive, prônant l'esprit d'équipe, le dépassement de soi et le respect d'autrui? Ces valeurs sont partagées par l'e-sport et par le sport traditionnel, et il serait grand temps que le grand public en soit informé. Alors que cette discipline concerne aujourd'hui des millions de joueurs à travers le monde, l'exposer sous son meilleur jour à un public aussi large que celui des JO serait une belle avancée pour atténuer l'image injustement négative des jeux vidéo.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Ameziane's Edmonton-based lawyer, Nate Whitling, said the government's recent out-of-court settlement — worth a reported $10.5 million — with Khadr over violation of his rights has prevented scrutiny of Canada's alleged complicity in abuses at Guantanamo Bay.

According to his claim, Ameziane left Algeria in the 1990s to escape rising violence there.","TORONTO — An Algerian man is set to sue the federal government for the abuses he says he suffered at the hands of American security forces after he left Canada 15 years ago.

The unproven allegations by Djamel Ameziane, who was never charged or prosecuted, raise further questions about Canada's complicity in the abuse of detainees at Guantanamo Bay — a topic his lawyer said demands a full-scale public inquiry.

""My current situation is really bad, I am struggling to survive,'' Ameziane, 50, said from near Algiers. ""I was repatriated from Guantanamo and left like almost homeless. I couldn't find a job because of the Guantanamo stigma and my age, so a settlement would be very helpful to me to get my life back together.""

In a draft statement of claim obtained by The Canadian Press, Ameziane seeks damages of $50 million on the grounds that Canada's security services co-operated with their U.S. counterparts even though they knew the Americans were abusing him.

I couldn't find a job because of the Guantanamo stigma and my age, so a settlement would be very helpful to me to get my life back together. Djamel Ameziane

""The Crown's conduct constituted acquiescence and tacit consent to the torture inflicted upon the plaintiff,"" the lawsuit alleges.

Canadian intelligence, the suit alleges, began sharing information with the Americans after failing to pick up on the 1999 ""Millennium plot"" in which Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian who had been living in Montreal, aimed to blow up the Los Angeles airport. After 9/11, Canadian agents interrogated Ameziane at the infamous American prison in Cuba, as they did Canada's Omar Khadr, according to the claim.

Ameziane's Edmonton-based lawyer, Nate Whitling, said the government's recent out-of-court settlement — worth a reported $10.5 million — with Khadr over violation of his rights has prevented scrutiny of Canada's alleged complicity in abuses at Guantanamo Bay. A judicial inquiry is needed, Whitling said.

""Only then can the Canadian public come to understand the extent to which Canada is responsible for the torture of innocent detainees in the aftermath of 9/11,'' Whitling said.

More lawsuits from others could be coming

The lawyer, who said he planned to file the lawsuit in Court of Queen's Bench in Edmonton on Monday, said Ameziane would be prepared to put the claim on hold in exchange for an inquiry. Whitling also said two other people planned similar suits that name the federal government, RCMP and Canadian Security and Intelligence Service.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale had no comment given the pending legal proceedings.

The U.S. detained Ameziane at Guantanamo Bay for more than 11 years until his release in December 2013.

""For many years, I had the idea of suing the Canadian government but didn't know how and honestly didn't know it was possible until I read the news about the settlement of Omar Khadr, who was my fellow inmate in Guantanamo Bay,"" Ameziane said. ""The action I am taking may also make (Canadian officials) think twice before acting against the interests of Canada and Canada's human values.""

According to his claim, Ameziane left Algeria in the 1990s to escape rising violence there. After working as a chef in Austria, he came to Canada in December 1995 and asked for refugee status. He lived in Montreal for five years, attending mosques where the Americans said members of al-Qaida prayed.

Claims Canadian intel sent him to Gitmo

When Canada rejected his request for asylum, Ameziane opted to go to Afghanistan rather than Algeria, where he feared abuse. He left Afghanistan for Pakistan in October 2001 when fighting erupted, but was captured and turned over to American forces in exchange for a bounty, his claim states.

The Americans first took him to a detention facility in Kandahar, where he alleges guards brutalized him, then sent him to Guantanamo Bay based partly on information provided by Canadian intelligence, according to his claim.

Ameziane, who denies any terrorism links, says Canadian agents interviewed him in Guantanamo in February and May 2003 and turned over recordings of the interrogations to the Americans. They did so, he claims, despite widespread allegations that U.S. forces were abusing detainees and even though they knew he faced no charges and had no access to a lawyer or the courts.

I refused to answer questions, after that I was subjected to a worse treatment by the Americans. Djamel Ameziane

Ameziane alleged American officials interrogated him hundreds of times and abused him when they decided he wasn't co-operating. The abuse, he alleges, included sleep-deprivation, intrusive genital searches, pepper-spraying, waterboarding, being left in freezing conditions, and having his head slammed against walls and the floor, dislocating his jaw.

""Canadian officials came to interview me on two occasions (and) they not only shared information about me with my American torturers but even tried to get information out of me that had nothing to do with Canada in order to help my American torturers,"" Ameziane said. ""I refused to answer questions, after that I was subjected to a worse treatment by the Americans.''

Actually, the fact that Harry is somewhat of a Horcrux became the center of a popular theory a couple of years ago, and it seemed to finally explain why the Dursleys were so horrible to the wizard all this time.

According to the theory, the Dursleys were such turd buckets because Harry was a Horcrux and they had to live with him for years. Just like Slytherin’s Locket adversely affected Ron’s mood during “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Harry may have had a similar effect on the Dursleys. Though Ron and Hermione spent a lot of time with Harry at Hogwarts, the Dursleys were with him constantly over a much longer period of time.

In an interview with Daniel Radcliffe about his new movie “Jungle,” we brought up the theory and asked if it could explain why the Dursleys were so mean.

“Oh OK, so it affects the behavior of people around it,” he said. “That’s interesting, yeah.”

Radcliffe continued, “Yeah, that’s definitely the first time I’ve heard that one. It’s definitely interesting because it sort of posits a world where these people only known to be a certain way. Actually if you remove him from the situation, [they] would have been quite a nice, friendly family.”

OK, maybe “friendly family” is a stretch.

“Having been there for Richard Griffiths’ (Vernon) and Fiona Shaw’s (Petunia) performances,” Radcliffe said, “I feel like it was more they just hated having this kid around.”

“But I think that’s definitely a cool theory,” he added. “Has anyone asked Jo Rowling what she thinks of that one yet? I feel like that one ― that’s definitely a good one.”

Though it’s not in the books, J.K. Rowling has written about the Dursleys’ dislike for Harry on Pottermore, calling them “reactionary, prejudiced, narrow-minded, ignorant and bigoted.” Rowling explained that Petunia’s loathing stemmed from jealousy of her sister Lily’s magical abilities, and that Vernon hated anything out of the ordinary. The couple also had a falling out with Harry’s parents and never made up.

Rowling doesn’t mention whether or not Harry being a Horcrux contributed to the Dursleys’ hatred; however, the theory does make a lot of sense and offers a unique way of looking at the family.

Kelley was previously a member of the United States Air Force, serving at a base in New Mexico.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas ― More than 100 people gathered outside the post office here on Sunday night, just blocks away from the First Baptist Church where a lone gunman killed 26 members of this tight-knit community on Sunday morning. It was the worst mass killing in the state's history.

""Who are we going to be tomorrow?"" Stephen Curry, a pastor from a nearby church, asked the crowd. ""We're going to be people of love.""

""Amen!"" the audience exclaimed.

Mourners held candles and raised their open palms in the air as religious leaders urged them to help their neighbors heal. Reminders of the tragedy were all around them. Behind the vigil, the lights of a police car continued to flash, and the road toward the church remained blocked off.

Officials responded to reports of a gunman at the church at around 11:20 a.m. A young white male wearing black clothing and tactical gear ― identified in multiple media reports as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley ― had opened fire with a Ruger assault-type rifle outside the church and then entered the building as he continued to fire.

As the gunman left the church, a resident began firing with his own weapon, causing the suspect to flee in his car, officials said. The suspect was later found with a fatal gunshot wound in his vehicle in nearby Guadalupe County. Authorities said they did not know who fired the fatal shot. Multiple weapons were found inside the suspect's vehicle.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott confirmed that 26 people had been killed in the shooting during a press conference on Sunday afternoon. A pregnant woman and several children ― including the church pastor's 14-year-old daughter ― were among the dead. At least 20 people were injured. The ages of the wounded and dead ranged from 5 to 72 years. A witness told San Antonio TV station KENS 5 that the fatalities accounted for about half of the church's congregation.

Shocked community members were still reeling from the massacre that took place just hours before. They described the unincorporated community, home to cattle ranches and oil fields, as the type of place where everyone knows each other. People move there to avoid crime, residents told HuffPost.

Kelley was previously a United States Air Force member who served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, from 2010 until his bad conduct discharge in 2014. He was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child.

Well we have some good news because not only is backing up your iPhone incredibly quick and easy, but it also comes with some big benefits which are: You’ll never lose your photos if you drop your phone down the toilet. Your shiny new iPhone X can literally set itself up without you having to do a thing. All your downloaded music won’t be lost when you switch phones. Never lose your messages or WhatsApp messages if (again) you drop your phone down the toilet. You could actually increase the storage space on your iPhone. Now we’ve cleared that up, here are some simple steps for backing up your entire iPhone. What is iCloud? Before we get started on the specifics it’s probably good to quickly explain where you’re going to be storing all this information. Apple has a cloud-based ecosystem called iCloud. Think of it as a safe deposit box where a virtual clone of your phone and its entire contents are stored safely away from any puddles, toilet-based accidents or boxes filled with rice.

Turn On iCloud Backup Whereas before you might backup your iPhone via iTunes, iCloud Backup allows your phone to do it wirelessly and in the background Once turned on it will automatically backup everything on your phone when it’s plugged in and connected to a WiFi network. For the majority of us that’s when we go to bed, so it’ll just backup your phone while you’re asleep. 1. Settings - iCloud

And, more precisely, the chemical compounds which allowed it to happen.

We may have had several billion years under our belts to figure it out, but scientists today continue to be puzzled by how early cellular life on Earth first came to be.

Researchers have long speculated that a chemical reaction called phosphorylation was a crucial step in the arrival of early life forms.

This is because in order for life to come into existence it needed a few simple ingredients - strands of nucleotides to store genetic information, chains of amino acids for cell function, and lipids to form cell walls and other structures.

These are just basic requirements of all biological structures.

Despite knowing this, scientists had never been able to find a phosphorylating chemical agent that would have plausibly been around at this time, in the right quantities, in the right place, to serve as the trigger.

But now researchers at the Scripps Research Institute have found one that could have played this central role: diamidophosphate (DAP).

Senior author Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy and his colleagues have previously shown how DAP is able to generate a variety of simple sugars that are present in early life forms.

“That in turn would have allowed other chemistries that were not possible before, potentially leading to the first simple, cell-based living entities,” said Krishnamurthy.

“It reminds me of the fairy godmother in Cinderella, who waves a wand and poof, poof, poof, everything simple is transformed into something more complex and interesting,” he added.

It might have been able to do what early life forms required, but is there evidence that this compound even existed in this period?

Ο John Galsworthy* είχε πει πως: «Ο ιδεαλισμός αυξάνεται ευθέως ανάλογα με την απόσταση που έχει κανείς από το πρόβλημα».

Και δεν είχε καθόλου άδικο**. Οι εκφράσεις αυτού, άλλωστε, είναι διάσπαρτες στην καθημερινότητά μας και εύκολο να εντοπιστούν.

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να γνωρίζει προβλήματα και λύσεις για καταστάσεις που εξελίσσονται μακριά του και δεν τον αφορούν άμεσα, από τον πόλεμο στο Αφγανιστάν και τις τρομοκρατικές επιθέσεις στην Ευρώπη, έως την κλυδωνιζόμενη οικονομία της Κίνας και τα τεκταινόμενα στην Αμερικανική πολιτική σκηνή;

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να υποστηρίζει με θέρμη (αδιαπραγμάτευτα θα έλεγε κανείς) ένα ευρύ σύνολο αρχών/αξιών, από την αριστεία και την αξιοκρατία (σ.σ. δύο από τις πιο γλυκιές «ιδεολογικές καραμέλες» της εποχής μας), έως την ελευθερία της έκφρασης και την ελευθερία της αυτοδιάθεσης;

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να είναι άτεγκτος έναντι αυτών που έχουν οδηγήσει στον εκμαυλισμό του σύγχρονου βίου, από τους λαοπλάνους και τους διεφθαρμένους πολιτικούς, έως τους φοροφυγάδες και τους ανεπαρκείς δημόσιους λειτουργούς;



Και πόσες φορές, ανατρέχοντας με ειλικρίνεια στη δική σας συμπεριφορά, δεν έχετε υπάρξει εσείς αυτό ο «κάποιος»;

Η σημασία την εν λόγω στάσης, καθώς και των προεκτάσεων που αυτή έχει στη ζωή του σύγχρονου ανθρώπου, είναι δύσκολο να αναλυθεί σε ένα τόσο σύντομο κείμενο. Μία σχετικά «αθώα» έκφανσή της, ωστόσο, μπορεί να αναγνωριστεί στην προσωπική ιστορία μίας παλαιότερη συζήτησης που είχα με τον παππού μου, η οποία και ακολουθεί.

Ο παππούς Χρήστος, συνταξιούχος δάσκαλος, ετών 90 σήμερα, υπήρξε - με βάση όχι μόνο της οικογενείας αλλά κυρίως έξωθεν μαρτυρίες - υπόδειγμα δασκάλου στο Νομό Γρεβενών όπου και υπηρέτησε. Άτεγκτος, ευσυνείδητος, διατελέσας Επιθεωρητής... Δε σήκωνε μύγα στο σπαθί του ως δάσκαλος, δικαιολογημένα, και ακόμη δε σηκώνει.

Κάποια χρόνια μετά το ξεκίνημα της κρίσης, λοιπόν, κι ενώ έβλεπε τη σύνταξη του να μειώνεται με εκθετικό ρυθμό μου είπε σε μια κουβέντα μας: «Ας τις μειώσουν κι άλλο τις συντάξεις αν είναι να πάει καλύτερα το κράτος... Εμείς ως δάσκαλοι, ενώ με τους μισθούς μας απλά ζούσαμε αξιοπρεπώς (σ.σ. η αναφορά αφορά τις δεκαετίες του '50-'70), με τις συντάξεις μας κάναμε σπίτια, αγοράσαμε αυτοκίνητα, βοηθήσαμε παιδιά κι εγγόνια...Ας τις μειώσουν κι άλλο.»

Παππού του λέω μετά από σύντομη σκέψη...«Αν όπως λες όλα αυτά τα χρόνια παίρνατε υψηλές συντάξεις, δυσανάλογες δηλαδή των εισφορών σας, και αύριο βγει μια απόφαση που θα λέει ότι δικαιούσασταν αρκετά χαμηλότερες, όσες οι τωρινές, και σας ζητήσει το κράτος να επιστρέψετε αναδρομικά τα πλεονάσματα που έχετε λάβει, θα τα δώσεις; Έχεις να τα δώσεις;»

Κάπου εκεί σάστισε και χαμογέλασε αμήχανα, καταλαβαίνοντας τι ήθελα να του πω.

Στην ιστορία που σας μετέφερα ο παππούς μου διατύπωσε μία άποψη κινούμενος από τη διάθεσή του να συνεισφέρει ώστε να βελτιωθούν τα δημόσια οικονομικά. Ακόμη και στην περίπτωση αυτή, όμως, στην οποία ο ίδιος έβαζε το προσωπικό του οικονομικό συμφέρον κάτω από αυτό του συνόλου, το έως ποιο βαθμό ήταν διατεθειμένος να φτάσει είναι και αυτό που αγγίζει την ουσία του ζητήματος στο οποίο αναφέρθηκε μέσω του γνωμικού του ο Galsworthy. Σε μια - όπως προείπα - σχετικά «αθώα» έκφανσή του με πολλά θετικά στοιχεία.

Επεκτείνοντας ωστόσο αυτή τη συλλογιστική, είναι εύκολο να διακρίνουμε και ένα βασικότατο μας πρόβλημα ως πολίτες και ως άνθρωποι. Το γεγονός, δηλαδή, ότι ιδεολογούμε και επιχειρηματολογούμε με χαρακτηριστικά μεγαλύτερη ευκολία από όση θα έπρεπε να μας επιτρέπει η διάθεσή μας να συμβάλλουμε στην αλλαγή της υφιστάμενης κατάστασης. Όχι από πονηρία, ατιμία ή ανικανότητα πάντα, αλλά αρκετές φορές και μόνο από την απλή αδυναμία μας να έρθουμε κοντά στο πρόβλημα, να το σκεφτούμε σαν να είναι δικό μας, και να βάλουμε τους εαυτούς μας στη θέση του συνόλου αυτών που καλούνται να το αντιμετωπίσουν.

Να το θέσουμε ακόμη απλούστερα και προσαρμοσμένο στην καθημερινότητά μας;



Είσαι υπέρ της αριστείας;



Επίλεξέ την όταν ως επιχειρηματίας επιλέγεις συνεργάτες ή εργαζομένους, όταν ως πελάτης επιλέγεις προμηθευτές, όταν ως επαγγελματίας συναγωνίζεται με καλύτερούς σου.

Είσαι υπέρ της αξιοκρατίας;



Στήριξέ την σε κάθε περίπτωση, ακόμη και όταν θα αφορά τους φίλους σου, τα παιδιά σου, ή κι εσένα τον ίδιο.

Είσαι υπέρ της δίκαιης φορολόγησης;



Μη φοροδιαφεύγεις και επίμενε στην τήρηση της ορθής φορολογικής συμπεριφοράς από όλους, ανεξάρτητα από το όποιο βραχυπρόθεσμο δικό σου όφελος.

Είσαι υπέρ της κοινωνικής δικαιοσύνης;



Απαίτησε την ανάλογη στάση από τους πολιτικούς σου, τους συνεργάτες σου, τους φίλους σου, την οικογένειά σου, και μην ψάχνεις «παραθυράκια» για να δικαιολογήσεις την αδικία όταν άμεσα ή έμμεσα σε ευνοεί.

Οι φίλοι μας οι Αμερικανοί μέσα στον (υπέρμετρο) υλισμό τους θέτουν το όλο ζήτημα αρκετά εύστοχα.

«Put your money where your mouth is», λένε, με το «money» να χρησιμοποιείται κυριολεκτικά όσο και μεταφορικά.

Αν θέλουμε δε να κάνουμε αναφορά και στο ελληνικό δαιμόνιο (sic) επάνω στην παραγωγή συνθημάτων, μπορούμε να ανατρέξουμε στην παλαιότερη τηλεοπτική διαφήμιση τσίχλας η οποία κατέληγε πως:

""Μερικές φορές είναι καλύτερο να μασάς παρά να μιλάς"".

Toronto researcher and photographer Kyler Zeleny has a new book out on Polaroid photography.

""My mind goes pretty wild thinking of all the possibilities,"" the photographer told HuffPost Canada in an email. ""This image ... is telling us that a story took place, that this man lived a life — we can see that in his auburn hair and the wrinkles on his face.""

Zeleny grew up on a farm in central Alberta and is usually based in Toronto. He's currently in London, doing a fellowship at Goldsmiths, University of London.

His obsession with mysterious Polaroids grew from a hobby to making a website to publishing a book. He spent years collecting more than 6,000 Polaroids from shops in Calgary, Toronto, New York and Amsterdam, and then on eBay. His new book, Found Polaroids, matches these pictures with flash fiction (very short stories) contributed by strangers online.

Kyler Zeleny collected 6,000 Polaroid pictures in the hopes of identifying their subjects.

""The original intent of the project was to return the found images back to their original owners, although that has proved mostly futile,"" Zeleny said. ""Understanding how futile it was to try to return these images, I thought it was quite a shame to allow the Polaroids to live in a state of limbo ... So I came up with the idea to allow people to contribute flash-fiction stories in response to the Polaroids, answering for who [the people in the photos] could have been, where they could have gone and what they might have known.""

Found Polaroids includes 35 of the 400 short stories Zeleny received online, as well as essays on Polaroid photography.

Photographer Kyler Zeleny's new book 'Found Polaroids' gives new life to old pictures.

Zeleny says Polaroids are unlike any other type of photograph.

""It has no negative and cannot be reproduced,"" he said. ""It really is the only photographic medium that allows us to make that claim.""

From his thousands of images, Zeleny was able to track down a total of four subjects. In one case, he got in touch with two former cheerleaders by looking up the team's logo, identifying the school they went to, and then reaching out to the current cheerleading squad.

""One thing that still remains a mystery in all the cases is either who took the image, or how it came to be in my possession,"" Zeleny said.

Read a story from FoundPolaroids.com:

By Christin Peter ""How to tell them?"" I wonder. I haven't even been sitting on this couch for an hour, and I've already smoked three cigarettes. Jack is in the other room, and I'm afraid I've made him angry because he acts like the whole thing is a joke. At twenty-one, I'm not a baby by any means, but since I'm her youngest child my mama thinks I am. And right now I feel like one. I just want to curl up with the plush frog Karen made me, close my eyes, and be someone new, someone younger. Or maybe just someone smarter. Jack enters the room, fiddling with his camera. ""So just tell them,"" he says. ""It doesn't have to be a big deal. You're an adult. You can make your own decisions."" Yes, I'm legally an adult, but I'm still in college. And I'm also in his apartment instead of my dorm. I try to do the math in my head, trying to figure out if there is some way to still graduate, but I know it's impossible. It's still only January. ""We can go to the courthouse this weekend. Tell them after; I don't care."" Jack raises his camera to his face. ""Come on, smile. This should be a happy day."" My mother got married young—at a mere nineteen years of age—but it was not what I had envisioned for myself. I was going to get a degree and then join the Peace Corps. I was going to travel, then get a teaching job, then get married and have children. But it was too late for that now. ""Come on, Lizzie. Show me a smile."" I can't find one. I still don't know how I'm going to tell my parents.

Ein Mann hat Geiseln im Jugendamt von Pfaffenhofen genommen

Medienberichten zufolge soll der Hintergrund ein Sorgerechtsstreit sein

Die Geiselnahme im Jugendamt in des Landkreises Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm hat die Polizei beendet. Ein 28-jähriger Mann, der eine Sachbearbeiterin über Stunden in seiner Gewalt hatte, sei festgenommen worden, sagte ein Sprecher am Montag. Ein Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) nutzte nach den Angaben einen günstigen Moment, um den Mann zu überwältigen.

Der Geiselnehmer hatte sich gegen 8.30 Uhr mit der Sachbearbeiterin am Jugendamt des oberbayerischen Landkreises verbarrikadiert. Er bedrohte die 31-Jährige mit einem Messer mit zehn Zentimeter langer Klinge. Die Frau erlitt eine Schnittwunde am Oberkörper. Ob er weitere Waffen bei sich hatte, war zunächst unklar.

Polizei: ""Der Täter spricht mit uns""

Das Gebäude in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft des Landratsamtes in Pfaffenhofen war am Morgen kurz nach der Geiselnahme geräumt worden. Danach befanden sich lediglich Opfer und Täter in dem Haus, erläuterte der Sprecher.

Es begann ein stundenlanger Nervenkrieg: Die Polizei war mit einem Großaufgebot vor Ort. Auch mehrere Krankenwagen und Ärzte sowie Sanitäter wurden zum Tatort geschickt.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Geiselnahme in dem Jugendamt baten die Ermittler darum, keine Bilder oder Videos vom Tatort zu verbreiten. Solche Bilder im Netz könnten dem Täter helfen, twitterte die Polizei.

Bitte unterstützt uns bei unserer Arbeit in #Pfaffenhofen und verbreitet KEINE Bilder, Videos etc. Ihr helft damit dem Täter. — Polizei Oberbayern N (@polizeiOBN) 6. November 2017

Unterdessen nahm die Verhandlungsgruppe telefonisch Kontakt mit dem Geiselnehmer auf. Die speziell für Geiselnahmen geschulten Beamten versuchten, deeskalierend auf den Mann einzuwirken.

Als die Frau darum bat, dass ein Arzt gerufen wird, griff das SEK zu und überwältigte den 28-Jährigen. Es kam dabei nicht zu einem Schusswaffeneinsatz.

Die 31-jährige Sachbearbeiterin war nach den Angaben psychisch stabil. Sie habe lediglich eine leichte Schürfwunde. Es könne derzeit nicht eingeordnet werden, woher die Verletzung rührt.

Wieso es keine Bilder vom Ort der Geiselnahme geben soll

Das Opfer sei zwar psychisch angegriffen, körperlich aber nicht schwer verletzt, teilte die Polizei weiter mit. Auch der mutmaßliche Täter sei weitgehend unverletzt.

Capite che sono ipotesi campate in aria che non si realizzeranno mai.","Non ci voleva la debacle delle elezioni siciliane per capire lo stato di salute della sinistra. Il male di quella parte politica è storico: dividersi quando non si riesce stare in minoranza e si vorrebbe che le proprie ragioni, minoritarie, fossero assunte dalla maggioranza, senza fiato ferire. Quando tutto questo non si realizza si evocano fantasmi, si fa appello alla democrazia che non c'è più, all'ideologia in disuso pur di fare testimonianza e rinfocolare i rancori. Questo è avvenuto nel Pd. La ditta Bersani e D'Alema ha fatto più danni che Bertoldo in guerra. I primi cento passi siciliani non si sono visti e oggi la sinistra è punto a capo.

Renzi potrà fare anche un passo indietro e lasciare spazio a una persona che raccolga i rimasugli ma, dubitiamo, come sempre abbiamo sostenuto, sull'efficacia del dopo, un percorso fatto di mediazioni, posti da dividere salvo poi accorgersi che dialoghi e programmi fumosi, tutto e niente, sono merce di qualità taroccata dalla quale gli elettori si tengono alla larga.

È sostanziale che Renzi abbia zero colpe in un presepe così desolante. E lo sosteniamo a ragion veduta perché l'ex Presidente del Consiglio, malgrado la sua alterigia intellettuale, che non è sempre un male in un paese gerentocratico e caotico fino al midollo, è stato fin troppo tollerante con le minoranze dentro il Pd, lasciandole fare nell'opposizione al leader-segretario accentuando così quell'opera di decostruzione d'immagine che ha condotto alle dimissioni di Renzi dalla carica di premier.

Si profila all'orizzonte un ulteriore processo a Renzi, confermando così che la Ditta di sinistra-sinistra ha in mente solo le messa a riposo del leader del Pd. Settimane su settimane di discussioni, convegni, caminetti di cui Bersani&D'Alema sono maestri professionali.

Avremo una candidatura del presidente Grasso a capo dell'arcipelago della sinistra-sinistra? Ho già spiegato in un post i limiti dell'ex magistrato di Palermo. Non ha consenso dentro il suo patchwork di riferimento ma nemmeno fuori, in zona Pd, visto che era stato proposto candidato unitario dallo stesso Renzi - appunto giusto per ricordare chi divide e chi unisce la sinistra - ma probabilmente il presidente Grasso aveva già in mente altro, o gli era stato promesso altro di più allettante, sempre però con l'obiettivo di tenersi lontano da eventuali unioni sotto il marchio renziano.

Sia chiaro. La legge elettorale in vigore non prevede l'elezione del premier. E nemmeno un leader di coalizione. È una discussione di lana caprina starci su. L'obiettivo è quello di superare soglia 40% per vincere. Ma con spirito proporzionale si va verso questo traguardo. Quindi a regime potenziato di singolo partito e capo di quel partito. Dopo il risultato della cabina elettorale si vedono le forze in campo e Mattarella sceglie il premier, certo indicato dai partiti. Ma prima del rush finale non servono nemmeno le primarie di coalizione, ma il solo principio che vale è sintetizzato da quel genialone di Berlusconi che per arrivare al dunque e farsi capire è imbattibile: il partito della coalizione che prende più voti indica il premier. Questo dovrebbe essere il principio ispiratore anche nel centrosinistra, senza perdersi nei meandri dell'ovvio e del banale.

Ma i preludi futuri non sottintendono nulla di confortante: a meno che Bersani e D'Alema se ne vadano dalla scena politica e con loro rimangano a riposo eventuali ritorni come quello di Vendola, che ha già lisciato il pelo all'avvento di Grasso premier. Capite che sono ipotesi campate in aria che non si realizzeranno mai. Troppo il livore in circolo, la voglia di rivincite impossibili, l'odio politico verso Renzi. La palla passerà al leader democratico che dovrà ritrovare carica e convinzione per farcela da solo con alcune liste importanti che facciano leva su movimenti, stati d'animo diffusi, a sinistra come al centro, slegate dai partiti ma con la disponibilità di correre a fianco del Pd in una alleanza inedita di Governo.",La ditta Bersani-D'Alema fa più danni che Bertoldo in guerra,http://www.huffingtonpost.it/maurizio-guandalini/la-ditta-bersani-dalema-fa-piu-danni-che-bertoldo-in-guerra_a_23267710/

It might be your favourite comfort food when you're sick, but it's not going to become India's national dish.

Following multiple reports that announced the Indian government's intention to designate khichdi as the country's national dish, the union food minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said it was all ""fictitious"".

Enough Khichdi cooked up on a fictitious 'National Dish'. It has only been put for a record entry in #WorldFoodIndia. — Harsimrat Kaur Badal (@HarsimratBadal_) November 1, 2017

She had earlier been quoted as saying, ""Khichdi is considered nutritious, healthiest food in India and it is is eaten by poor and rich alike, irrespective of their class. It symbolises India's great culture of unity in diversity. So it has been selected as the brand of Indian food.""

Badal had been speaking at an event before the World Food India conference, where celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor is expected to cook 800 kilograms of khichdi in an attempt to set a world record. However, news reports soon appeared suggesting that this was part of a decision to make khichdi a national dish.

Instead, it will be reportedly promoted as a ""Brand India Food"" globally.

There are still three weeks until the November 25 ballot, which means that Australia will have to endure at least some One Nation-branded campaigning.



Here are three things you should expect in the coming weeks:

1. Electricity, Electricity, Electricity

According to Hanson, keeping electricity bills down is the single most important issue for One Nation in the election.

The senator is set to announce a plan for Queensland One Nation to use $1.4 billion worth of profits from government-owned assets to create electricity subsidies for households. The proposal will aim to undercut the Labor Party's proposed electricity policy, which planned to shave off $50 from each household electricity bill.

Speaking to The Australian, Hanson said that the cost of electricity was ""the main thing affecting the whole state"".



""I have travelled all over Queensland and people are suffering across the state, businesses are closing down and it's hurting ordinary families,"" she said.

On Sunday Queensland Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls threw his hat into the ring, pledging to reduce household power bills by $160 over two years.

2. Less Criticism Of Islam

This one might come as a bit of a shock. One Nation's most recent 30-page Queensland policy booklet doesn't even mention mosques, halal food, or Islam.

And even more suprisingly -- One Nation candidate Shane Holley recently campaigned outside Logan Mosque alongside local Muslims, calling for ""harmony"" in the seat of Stretton.



Holley told the crowd that it was ""fantastic to be able to dispel some of the myths out there"" about One Nation, according to SBS.

IMMIGRATION POLICY | @PaulineHansonOz speaks for the silent majority but the other parties refuse to listen. #auspolhttps://t.co/V4nlojwOh1 — Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) October 26, 2017

This stance is at odds with the party's past calls for a Royal Commission into Islam and a ban on Muslim immigration into Australia -- and there's no knowing whether it will hold as Hanson joins the campaign trail on Monday.

3. Malcolm Roberts!

If you thought the High Court decision that kicked Malcolm Roberts out of Federal Parliament would get rid of him for good, think again -- he's campaigning to be the candidate for the state seat of Ipswich.

Ipswich has traditionally been seen as a Labor safe-haven, with the LNP only winning the seat once in the past 34 years. The close-by seat of Lockyer was almost won by Hanson when she ran for it in 2015.

Election analyst Antony Green told the Sydney Morning Herald that it would be ""highly surprising if One Nation won there on first preferences, which would mean they would have to come from behind on LNP preferences"".

He suggested that One Nation has a greater shot at grabbing the Ipswich West and Lockyer seats. Labor currently holds the seat by a 16-point margin.

Das ändert sich allerdings gerade, was nicht zuletzt auf Bücher wie „Das geheime Leben der Bäume"", „Gebrauchsanweisung für den Wald"", „Das geheime Netzwerk der Natur"" des schreibenden Försters Peter Wohlleben zurückzuführen ist. Wälder sind für ihn nicht nur „Holzfabriken und Rohstofflager"", sondern auch Lebensräume für viele Tier- und Pflanzenarten, die miteinander verwoben und voneinander abhängig sind. Immer, wenn sie sich artgerecht entfalten können, bieten sie Schutz und Erholung. Mit seinem Engagement setzt er ein hoffnungsvolles Zeichen für die Zukunft, dass das geheime Leben der Wälder und der Bäume weiterhin stattfindet und auch unsere Nachfahren noch staunend zwischen den Bäumen spazieren können.

Der Aufenthalt in der Natur verbessert die Stimmung und entlastet die Atemwege. Deshalb ist es wichtig, in die Stadtbebauung mehr Grün zu integrieren - das beeinflusst positiv Herzschlag und das vegetative Nervensystem. „Es geht dabei nicht um Sauerstoff, sondern offensichtlich um einen Reiz, der unser vegetatives Nervensystem runterfahren lässt"", sagt Peter Falkei, Direktor der Klinik und Poliklinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie am Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in München. Wenn man durch einen Wald geht, werden die neuronalen Netze „heruntergefahren"". Er vermutet, dass dies mit einem Gefühl von Geborgenheit zu tun hat, einem Schutz vor Lärm und Stress. Auch regenerieren sich Hirnareale, die zuständig für Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration sind, während eines Spaziergangs, der uns hilft, wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu kommen in der Schräglage der Welt.

Städte machen nervöser und lassen Menschen schlechter schlafen. Auch Lichtverschmutzung ist ein enormes Gesundheitsrisiko. Im Gehirn kommen die beiden Schaltstellen Mandelkern und Cingulum ins Spiel: Der Mandelkern reagiert auf Dinge, die er nicht kennt und nicht verorten kann; das Cingulum macht den Relevanzcheck: Ist etwas wichtig für die eigene Person oder nicht? Aktuelle Studien belegen, dass beide bei Menschen, die in Städten mit mehr als 100.000 Einwohnern aufwachsen, aktiver sind, was zu einer Grundunruhe der Städter führt, „einer Art unproduktiven Aufmerksamkeit"" (Falkei). Meistens sind Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen auf private Stressfaktoren und berufliche Probleme zurückzuführen.

Viele Menschen greifen dann auf Antidepressiva zurück. Laut Depressionsatlas der deutschen Techniker Krankenkasse hat sich zwischen 2000 und 2013 die verschriebene Tagesmenge an Antidepressiva verdreifacht. 2015 zahlten die gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen dafür rund 750 Millionen Euro an die Pharmaindustrie.

Statt auf Medikamente zu setzen verordnen Ärzte in Japan ihren Patienten Waldtherapien, denn bewusstes Gehen durch den Wald ist gesundheitsfördernd. Inzwischen hat der Trend auch Deutschland erreicht. Auf Usedom darf sich seit September 2017 ein Wald „Kur- und Heilwald"" nennen.

Für 94 Prozent der erwachsenen Deutschen gehören die Natur und insbesondere der Wald zu einem guten Leben. Das ist das Ergebnis einer Studie des Bundesamtes für Naturschutz (BfN) zum Naturbewusstsein der Deutschen, die 2016 erschien. Die Nähe zur Natur ist mit einer größeren Lebenszufriedenheit verbunden.

Bäume haben bis heute nur deshalb überlebt, weil sie eine enorme (Widerstands-)Kraft bzw. Resilienz und genetische Vielfalt innerhalb einer Art aufweisen. „Fest und stark ist nur der Baum, der unablässig Winden ausgesetzt war, denn im Kampf festigen und verstärken sich seine Wurzeln"", schrieb schon der römische Philosoph Seneca. Wo sich Bäume wieder erneuern, erleben sich auch die Menschen als selbst regulierendes Prinzip. Bäume, die bis heute einzigartig sind, dienten den Menschen als Heiligtum, als Nahrungs- und Inspirationsquelle. Prominente Baumliebhaber waren Goethe, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Bismarck, Hermann Hesse, Kurt Tucholsky, Winston Churchill, Ruth Maria Kubitschek oder Michael Gorbatschow.

Der Wald hat heute neben der Holzproduktion seine größte Bedeutung im Klimaschutz - nämlich die (über)lebensnotwendige CO2-Sequestrierung. Deshalb muss eine nachhaltige Optimierung zwischen der Holzproduktion und der Klimawirkung gesucht werden. Viele große private Waldbesitzer in Deutschland haben (häufig im Gegensatz zu den Staatsforsten) seit langem einen hohen Holzvorrat im Wald angestrebt. Damit verbunden ist die Befolgung einer dynamischen Nachhaltigkeitsregel (Holz + CO2-Sequestrierung). In absehbarer Zukunft muss viel weniger Holz geschlagen werden, denn für den Klimaschutz ist es zwingend, die Biomasse im Wald mindestens bis ins Jahr 2150 so hoch wie möglich anwachsen zu lassen.

Der Begriff Nachhaltigkeit kommt aus der Forstwirtschaft und bezeichnet die Nutzung eines regenerierbaren Systems, so dass es in seinen wesentlichen Eigenschaften erhalten bleibt und sich auf natürliche Weise erneuern kann. Der US-amerikanische Songwriter, Country- und Folk-Sänger Songwriter John Denver gründete die Organisation „Plant It 2000"" zur Wiederaufforstung hunderttausender Bäume, der Unternehmer und Umweltaktivist Douglas Tompkins, Gründer und ehemaliger Chef der Textilmarken The North Face und Esprit Holdings Limited, kaufte ein großes Gebiet in Argentinien und Chile auf, um Nationalparks zu schaffen. Und der ehemalige Chefdirigent der Berliner Philharmoniker Claudio Abbado ermöglichte mit zwei Konzerthonoraren die Anpflanzung von 90.000 Bäumen in seiner Heimatstadt Mailand.

In seinem Privatgarten am Landsitz Highgrove spricht Prinz Charles regelmäßig mit seinen Bäumen und behandelt sie fast wie Persönlichkeiten. Zudem setzt er sich seit Jahrzehnten mit seinen Stiftungen für Naturschutz und Artenvielfalt ein.

Als der Reformator Martin Luther im April 1539 in seinem Garten die Bäume betrachtete, sprach er: „Gelobt sei Gott, der Schöpfer, der aus toten verstorbenen Kreaturen im Lenz alles wieder lebendig macht!"" Er liebte Bäume aber nicht nur wegen ihrer Erhabenheit und Schönheit, sondern auch wegen ihres nachhaltigen Nutzens. Sein berühmter Satz „Wenn ich wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, würde ich heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen."", lässt sich zwar nicht belegbar nachweisen, weil der erste schriftliche Nachweis erst in einem Rundbrief der hessischen Kirche aus dem Jahre 1944 zu finden ist - dennoch wäre diese Aussage sicher in seinem Sinne gewesen.

Ein immerwährender Neuanfang.

Bailey, a former member of Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee, came forward last week to say she was raped at a party event in 2011, when she was 19, and was discouraged from reporting the incident by a senior official.",LabourToo Sexual Harassment Probe To Report Findings To New Victim Support QC,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labourtoo-sexual-harassment-probe-to-report-findings-to-new-victim-support-qc_uk_5a005b67e4b0c9653000d9bb?uq&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

NEW DELHI -- All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who made the observation, also said even an accidental physical contact, though unwelcome, would not amount to sexual harassment.

""Similarly, a physical contact that has no undertone of a sexual nature and is not occasioned by the gender of the complainant may not necessarily amount to sexual harassment,"" the court said.

The observations by the Bench came during the hearing of an appeal by a Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) scientist challenging the clean chit given by the complaints committee and disciplinary authority to her former senior colleague, whom she had accused of sexual harassment.

Both of them were working in the CRRI, which is a part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).

The allegation pertained to an incident of April 2005 when the man had entered the laboratory where the woman was working and had snatched samples from her hand, thrown the materials and pushed her out of the room.

The woman had contended that any unwelcome physical contact would amount to sexual harassment.

The Complaints Committee after examining her complaint had concluded that ""it was a case of altercation in the background of the uncongenial environment prevailing in the division.""

Terming the man's conduct as deplorable, it had also said while there was evidence of physical contact by the man, ""the same was not a sexually determined behaviour but was in the nature of an altercation.""

The disciplinary authority had accepted the committee's report and passed an order in October 2009 giving clean chit to the man accused of sexual harassment.

Agreeing with the committee's finding, the High Court said, ""Undoubtedly, physical contact or advances would constitute sexual harassment provided such physical contact is a part of the sexually determined behaviour. Such physical contact must be in the context of a behaviour which is sexually oriented.""

The court also rejected the woman's challenge to the constitution of the committee and the disciplinary authority, saying it finds no infirmity in their set-up.

BHOPAL – A 19-year-old college student was on the way back from her coaching class when she was kidnapped by four youths, dragged to a desolate spot near a railway track close to Habibganj station, and raped for hours.

The woman is pursuing her graduation and preparing for the civil services exam.

The youths escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station. The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Still, none of the two police stations — MP Nagar and Habibganj — both in the heart of New Bhopal, registered an FIR, passing the buck, saying that the area of the crime did not fall under their jurisdiction.

The alleged rapists took gutkha, cigarette and tea breaks between the horrific assault, the TOI report said.

The ordeal didn't end even after her ordeal. According to reports, at the Habibganj GRP, an officer allegedly accused the victim of ""making up a filmy story"".

The incident had occurred on late Tuesday night, and throughout Wednesday, the traumatized family had tried to get an FIR registered, until railway police took action.

The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Bhopal has ordered a probe into the incident of negligence in conducting their civic duty and SI RN Tekam of MP Nagar police station has been suspended.

The incident has led to shock in the state capital. The MP Human Rights Commission has sought a report from Bhopal police. The Opposition has targeted the state government for poor law-and-order.

But by 2007, researchers began to understand how disruptions in this rhythm can lead to health problems.
Secondary consequences — known as sequelae — also were investigated and showed symptoms such as weight gain and poor decision making were directly linked to a lack of proper rest.
Yet close to 20 years of research has revealed this tiny region seated deep in the brain is the primary regulator of the circadian rhythm.","You no doubt have heard about the need to get a proper amount of sleep. Public health authorities continually declare we all need on average seven hours of slumber every night to be at our best. Yet while these recommendations come with a warning about the troubles stemming from a lack of sleep, when it comes to what happens inside our bodies, the details are usually few and far between.

Now, thanks to a team of Australian researchers, we have a clearer understanding of what happens at the molecular level when we disrupt these needed times of rest. The work reveals the impact goes far beyond grogginess and irritability. In many cases, sleep loss can give certain diseases the upper hand.

The team focused on the effects of what is known as the circadian rhythm. This biological phenomenon exists in all living organisms — even bacteria — and dictates when bodies should be active or at rest. The discovery was considered of such great importance the original researchers were awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine.

When the circadian rhythm was discovered, it was a mystery and any connection to health was speculative at best. But by 2007, researchers began to understand how disruptions in this rhythm can lead to health problems. A new branch of sleep medicine was developed in which disorders such as jet lag and altered timing of sleep became conditions worth documenting and treating based on our wake-sleep schedules.

Yet the studies did not stop there. Secondary consequences — known as sequelae — also were investigated and showed symptoms such as weight gain and poor decision making were directly linked to a lack of proper rest. As for the Australian researchers, they focused on a different problem with a much wider scope for health. Their interest lied in inflammation, one of the most troublesome issues in health today.

Body temperature, blood pressure, feeding times... are all affected.

The author's investigations stems from a relatively recent finding from 2015. Researchers learned of a connection between our immunity and a small section of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus, more commonly known as the SCN. At just under two millimetres in length, you might think this region would have little effect on us. Yet close to 20 years of research has revealed this tiny region seated deep in the brain is the primary regulator of the circadian rhythm. As studies have shown, the area also impacts almost all of our bodily processes.

The extent of influence on our bodily functions by the SCN is fascinating. Body temperature, blood pressure, feeding times and (not surprisingly) the feelings of wakefulness and tiredness are all affected by this little region. The 2015 study shows the immune system also responds to the calls from this region, altering how it functions during the course of a day. During the day and into the early evening, our immunity is active. Late at night and into the early morning hours, it is at rest. The balance ensures the forces maintain a proper balance and do not end up hyperactive or fatigued.

With this in mind, the Australian researchers explored the consequences to immune balance as a result of sleep deprivation. They found studies both in animals and humans revealing even a slight change in our regular circadian rhythm can lead to the development of low-level inflammation. For the authors, the rise of inflammation could worsen chronic diseases such as allergies, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No to mention the inflammation also leads to a poorer response to infection.

Thanks to this overview, the Australian researchers have shown at the microscopic and molecular levels why getting those seven hours of sleep is so important. They underscore the necessity of making sure people take better care of their health when faced with disruptions to the sleep cycle as a result of shift work, time zone travel and other disturbances. Perhaps most importantly, for those who cannot change their sleep schedules, the inner struggles may require us to be more observant of our behaviours.

As to how to accomplish this balance, the authors suggested treatment options focusing on inflammation as a target. While this direction will no doubt take years to achieve, there may be more natural options to improve the outlook. Proper diet and exercise can help to minimize the extent of inflammation. In addition, the use of melatonin also can provide some assistance. Then there is the potential for probiotics. While still in the early stages, we may be able to one day find a mixture designed to help us stay balanced when the world around us is being disrupted.

At least two people were killed and one wounded in a shooting inside a Walmart store in suburban Denver on Wednesday, police said.

Police in Thornton, Colorado, did not immediately release any information about the circumstances of the shooting or who was responsible for the gunfire.

In a Twitter post about 90 minutes after the shooting, police said investigators had confirmed that two men were dead and a woman was taken to a local hospital, but no further details were given.

The situation appeared potentially ominous from authorities' initial reports.

""We've got multiple parties down, we're still trying to ascertain what their conditions are,"" Officer Victor Avila of the Thornton Police Department told Reuters by telephone not long after police arrived on the scene.

#BREAKING Police in Thornton Co search @Walmart store after gunfire reported. Police also believe multiple people are down #fox5atl pic.twitter.com/jDI0MhWrRE — Paul Gourley (@pgFox5) November 2, 2017

About an hour after the initial alert, police said on Twitter that the threat of gunfire had ended at the store, which was surrounded by police and fire crews.

""At this time this is NOT an active shooter. Active crime scene. We will update as info becomes available,"" the police department said in that tweet. Confirmation of the two fatalities came about 20 minutes later.

Thornton is city of about 120,000 people roughly 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown Denver.

Avila said police were called to the store at about 6:30 p.m. Mountain time (8:30 p.m. ET) and that the gunshots had ceased by the time the first officers arrived at the scene.

A Walmart customer, Aaron Stephens, 44, of Thorton, told Reuters he was inside paying for groceries at a self-checkout stand when he heard gunshots and the sound of ricocheting bullets.

""The employees started screaming and the customers started screaming"" as people began to flee the store, he recounted. ""I ran out, too, because I didn't want to get shot.""

Stephens said he did not see where the shooting had come from and did not see anyone struck by bullets.

Local NBC television affiliate 9NEWS reported that a woman whose son was in the Walmart had told her that he had heard about 30 gunshots and was still inside.

A video posted on Twitter showed the Walmart, which is situated in a large complex of big-box stores and other retail outlets adjacent to U.S. Interstate 25, apparently empty except for police officers with guns drawn.",At Least Two Dead In Shooting Inside Walmart Store In Suburban Denver,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/01/at-least-two-dead-in-shooting-inside-walmart-store-in-suburban-denver_a_23264036/

Consequently, Zuma wrote to Abrahams demanding he explain why the president should not suspend him as NPA head and institute an inquiry into his fitness to hold office.
Hence, his appointment as NPA head raises eyebrows on two accounts.
First, consider what former NPA head Vusi Pikoli says in the book ""My Second Initiation"", co-authored with renowned South African journalist Mandy Wiener.
Suspending Pikoli as NPA head, Mbeki cited clause 179 (6) of the Constitution, according to which, he said, Mabandla ""exercised final responsibility for"" the NPA.","Before the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) could call for the Guptas to leave our country, I had made that call in an opinion piece, ""The time has come to send the Gupta family packing"". However, the news outlet took it offline the following day. This, to me, amounted to a sort of censorship. Hence, I have included it in my book ""The Thoughts of an Ordinary Citizen"" as an addendum, to let the readers decide whether it warranted censorship.

Fast forward, and I do not support the call anymore –– not until the Guptas have cleared their names on innumerable charges laid against them. While the evidence contained in the Gupta emails exposé, popularly known as the GuptaLeaks, may be inadmissible in a court of law due to their disputed acquisition and authenticity, Ajay Gupta, Duduzane Zuma, and Fana Hlongwane should by now at least have appeared in the court of law to face a charge of bribery.

Following his revelation that Ajay Gupta, in the presence of Duduzane Zuma and Hlongwane, offered him a whopping R6-million bribe to supersede Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister, former deputy minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas deposed an affidavit to that effect. In other words, a prima facie case of bribery exists for NPA head Shaun Abrahams to prosecute the trio. Duduzane and Hlongwane are accomplices.

Perhaps it would have emerged in the court of law whether Ajay, or any of the Gupta brothers, in the presence of this duo or someone else, made the same offer, if not more or less, to David van Rooyen, who succeeded Nene as finance minister. This seems even more probable, given that a night before his startling appointment as finance minister, he was in infamous Saxonwold, drinking tea with the Guptas.

At the same Saxonwold home, the Guptas offered former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor the position of public enterprise minister, on the condition that she would cancel a South African Airways route to their homeland India and give it to them, while President Jacob Zuma was sitting in another room. There is more to Van Rooyen's appointment as finance minister than meets the eye.

Most importantly, it would have emerged in the court of law whether the trio is a flight risk or not. The court would have made an appropriate ruling thereon.

If the Guptas, the Zumas, and those whose names appear in the GuptaLeaks skip the country to Dubai, Abrahams should face prosecution for obstruction of justice, which is tantamount to treason.

By selling the ANN7 and ""The New Age""(TNA) to their chief lackey, Mzwanele Manyi (if indeed they owned them in the first place), and Tegeta to Charles King SA, the Guptas and Zuma seem to be destined for Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where, as revealed in the GuptaLeaks, they have acquired luxurious residences.

Once in Dubai, it would be very difficult to extradite them to South Africa to clear their names. South Africa and the UAE have not signed the extradition and the Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) treaties into law. This would frustrate a commission of inquiry into state capture, if not render it futile.

If the Guptas, the Zumas, and those whose names appear in the GuptaLeaks skip the country to Dubai, Abrahams should face prosecution for obstruction of justice, which is tantamount to treason. In fact, the General Council of the Bar (GCB) should strike him off the roll of advocates for this obstruction of justice.

How he dealt with trumped-up charges of fraud against former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashule, and deputy former SARS commissioner Ivan Pillay, did not necessarily warrant the EFF lodging a complaint with the GCB to strike him off the roll, but his failure to prosecute the trio on the charge of bribery and obstruction of justice on state capture do. The decision to prosecute the trio on the trumped-up charges of fraud was also vested chiefly in him.

Announcing this decision, Abrahams was at pains to convince South Africans that the days of disrespecting the NPA are gone. Yet succumbing to public pressure a few weeks later, he dropped the charges against the trio, thus proving his unfitness to hold office.

Consequently, Zuma wrote to Abrahams demanding he explain why the president should not suspend him as NPA head and institute an inquiry into his fitness to hold office. However, there is nothing to write home about in this matter thus far. It is understandable, though, as his disinclination to prosecute Zuma on 783 counts of corruption, fraud, money laundering, racketeering and tax evasion benefits the president in the main. Hence, his appointment as NPA head raises eyebrows on two accounts.

For Zuma to become South African president, Mbeki and Pikoli had to go.

First, consider what former NPA head Vusi Pikoli says in the book ""My Second Initiation"", co-authored with renowned South African journalist Mandy Wiener. Pikoli says that while he was on suspension, Zuma's backers, including a lawyer and senior ANC leaders in KwaZulu-Natal whom he does not mention by name, paid him a visit to relay a message that ""the man"" wanted to see him.

In September 2007, citing an ""irretrievable break down [sic] in the working relationship"" between him and the Justice Minister, Brigitte Mabandla, and Pikoli's decision to grant convicted drug dealer Glen Agliotti and other members of his syndicate immunities so that they could become state witnesses in a case of corruption and fraud against former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi, former President Thabo Mbeki suspended Pikoli as NPA head, and instituted an inquiry into his fitness to hold office, chaired by former parliamentary speaker Frene Ginwala.

Having refused to go and meet Zuma, Pikoli says his backers wanted to know whether he would reinstate the charges against ""the man"" if he were to be kept as NPA head, despite Ginwala's finding on his fitness to hold office. No wonder caretaker President Kgalema Motlanthe, who was part of an ANC internal task team to advise on Zuma's case, removed him as NPA head and the ANC in Parliament rubberstamped his removal, despite Ginwala having declared him fit to hold office.

For Zuma to become South African president, Mbeki and Pikoli had to go. It would have been difficult for then-acting NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe, whom Pikoli says ""was put under political pressure"", to drop the charges against Zuma with Mbeki at the helm.

Suspending Pikoli as NPA head, Mbeki cited clause 179 (6) of the Constitution, according to which, he said, Mabandla ""exercised final responsibility for"" the NPA. Mabandla acted on behalf of the government, which, as Mbeki drew to Pikoli's attention, ""must and does have an interest in ensuring that the prosecuting authority services the public interest"".

Second, Abrahams' predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, said Zuma removed him amid the rumours that Nxasana would reinstate the charges against him. In other words, Abrahams may lose his job if he reinstates the charges against Zuma.

Inescapably, the question comes to mind whether Zuma's backers had also paid both Mpshe and Abrahams a visit, to cajole them into dropping the charges and not pursuing the case against ""the man"" respectively. Disappointingly, Pikoli stops short of mentioning who put Mpshe, who plagiarised an irrelevant Hong Kong-based judgment, under political pressure to drop the charges against Zuma.

The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) should investigate Mpshe, whose decision to drop the charges against Zuma the courts have declared irrational, for judicial misconduct. Admittedly, I'm on a wild-goose chase in this regard, as the JSC is, in colloquial terms, in the same WhatsApp group with the NPA and the Hawks. Nearly a decade later, the JSC has yet to investigate a case of judicial misconduct against Cape Town Judge President John Hlophe, not to mention that of Judge Mkola Motata for drunk driving.

Abrahams cannot drop the charges against Zuma based on a disputed KPMG audit report. The onus would lie with Zuma's lawyers to discredit the report in the court of law. He has no choice but to set a date for Zuma's day in court.

By announcing Naledi Pandor as his deputy, presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa is thinking ahead to the national elections in 2019, where the ANC will have to display a credible leadership structure to win back voters.

However, the decision may be detrimental to his own campaign for the number one spot come the ANC's national conference in December 2017, as Pandor does not have the backing of any significant constituencies in the party.

Political analysts say this was a very risky move on the part of the deputy president.

Ramaphosa's rationale to choose Pandor, who is currently the minister of science and technology, as his presidential running mate may form part of his bid to build a slate that has credibility, said the University of Witwatersrand's Susan Booysen.

Naledi Pandor is an excellent choice. Forget celebrities, think about good governance and delivery. She's a committed civil servant #CR17 — mrsberry (@berryricegp) November 5, 2017

""Pandor ticks the box of having senior women on the slate, which is a non-negotiable part of the current narrative. She has not expressed her own serious political ambition to get to the top of the party, and she has credibility,"" Booysen said.

""There is also an absence of corruption in her political career and this, coupled with her non-ambition for top posts, is what the ANC needs. She is not in the position for the sake of her own political ambitions.""

Nominating Pandor as deputy may have been motivated by gender considerations and perceptions that a person who is ""clean of corruption, and confident"" would enhance Ramaphosa's slate, said Mzukisi Qobo from the University of Johannesburg.

""The best move politically would have been to take on [the Mpumalanga premier] David Mabuza. The main consideration would be to win [the ANC presidential race in] 2017. One has to balance principle and pragmatism, and it seems Ramaphosa has veered to the side of principle,"" Qobo said.

Pandor would suit well as deputy president of South Africa, but not deputy president of the ANC, Qobo added.

""She does not have the temperament to fight internal party politics. She is more suited in government, but in the party, she may not do so well,"" he said.

Pandor as deputy president may inspire confidence in the ANC come 2019, said independent political analyst Ralph Mathekga.

""She has stayed away from the factions and comes with a great deal of credibility. It represents a great winning team for 2019. But is it strategic for now? I don't think so,"" Mathekga said.

""I don't know what she brings in terms of ANC constituencies. I'm not aware of her relationships with, and her political power over branches. Maybe this move will inspire ANC members to look beyond factions come December. But it is a risk.""

It is ""interesting"" that Ramaphosa's campaign managers announced a finalised slate a month before the conference, instead of keeping his cards on the table, politics expert Keith Gottschalk commented.

ÉDUCATION - Tous les devoirs faits au collège plutôt qu'à la maison pour les élèves qui le souhaitent: cette promesse, censée contribuer à réduire les inégalités entre familles, est entrée en vigueur ce lundi 6 novembre et sera étendue l'an prochain au primaire.

""Avec la mesure 'devoirs faits', nous offrons un soutien scolaire gratuit à tous les collégiens pour lutter contre les inégalités"", a déclaré le ministre de l'Education Jean-Michel Blanquer dans un entretien au quotidien 20 Minutes.

Certains élèves ne peuvent en effet pas se faire aider à la maison pour effectuer leurs devoirs, d'autres ne disposent pas d'un cadre serein pour les faire. ""Il s'agit d'aider les élèves qui ne bénéficient pas des circonstances familiales leur permettant de bien travailler à la maison"", a expliqué Jean-Michel Blanquer.

""La mesure est intéressante car on sait très bien que la question des devoirs est un facteur d'inégalités sociales"", estime Catherine Nave-Bekhti, secrétaire générale du Sgen-CFDT. ""Mais sa mise en oeuvre est un peu précipitée, elle intervient alors que les emplois du temps sont déjà calés, et il va falloir s'assurer que ce sont bien les élèves qui en ont le plus besoin qui en bénéficient"", souligne-t-elle.

Il s'agit d'un nouveau chantier pour le collège, après l'assouplissement de la réforme du collège (avec le retour des classes bilangues) et une modification probable du brevet pour la session 2018.

Quatre heures d'accompagnement par semaine

Cette mesure, qui rejoint une promesse de campagne d'Emmanuel Macron de rétablir des études dirigées au collège, sera appliquée dans les 7.100 établissements français, avant d'être étendue au primaire à la rentrée prochaine.

Elle devrait dans un premier temps concerner environ le quart des collégiens mais ""cela pourrait monter à 35% des élèves lorsque le dispositif sera mieux connu"", estime le ministre de l'Education.

Concrètement, une heure par jour d'accompagnement -soit quatre heures par semaine- sera proposée aux élèves. Selon les premiers retours, 35% des collèges mettront en œuvre la mesure en fin de journée et 65% lors de la pause de midi ou des heures de permanence.

Il y aura a minima un accompagnant pour 15 élèves.

Professeurs volontaires payés en heures sup et assistants d'éducation seront mobilisés. Le monde associatif, déjà très présent dans le domaine de l'aide aux devoirs, devrait aussi être impliqué.

S'y ajoutent 7.000 jeunes en service civique. ""Mais notre objectif est d'atteindre 10.000"", indique le ministre.

""S'agit-il d'études surveillées, d'une simple mise à disposition aux élèves d'un lieu pour faire leurs devoirs ou bien d'une véritable aide méthodologique?"", s'interroge Frédérique Rolet, secrétaire générale du Snes-FSU, pour qui les objectifs de cette mesure doivent encore être précisés.

En fonction des buts recherchés, une qualification des personnels assurant sa mise en œuvre pourrait s'avérer nécessaire.

Un coût de 220 millions d'euros en 2018

Une analyse partagée par Hervé-Jean Le Niger, vice-président de la FCPE (fédération de parents d'élèves): ""Il faut un accompagnement pédagogique de qualité"", a-t-il dit sur RTL, insistant sur le nécessaire ""lien"" entre ""l'équipe qui fait travailler les élèves et leurs professeurs habituels"". ""Sinon cela n'a aucun sens"".

""Il va falloir une vraie coordination au sein des collèges, avec quelqu'un capable d'animer l'équipe de volontaires"", prévient aussi Claire Krepper, secrétaire nationale du Se-Unsa.

Elle rappelle que la mesure n'est ""pas nouvelle"": ""Il y a déjà eu moult dispositifs, comme l'accompagnement éducatif"", mis en place en 2008 dans les écoles des quartiers défavorisés puis étendu aux collèges, qui proposait aux élèves des activités pédagogiques et éducatives après la classe.

""Là on a un recentrage sur le scolaire"", relève Claire Krepper. ""Si cela peut déboucher sur une réflexion, en équipe, sur la meilleure manière de faire travailler les élèves en dehors des heures de classe, c'est intéressant"", juge-t-elle. Mais ""encore faut-il que la mesure soit correctement financée"".

Die Familie Guttenberg soll während der NS-Zeit an den Enteignungen deutscher Juden mitverdient haben

Das berichtete das Magazin ""Bunte"" nach Sichtung mehrerer Archivdokumente

Ex-Verteidigungsminister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg hat viel Geld. Das ist kein Wunder, möchte man meinen, schließlich stammt er aus einem Adelshaus mit einem Millionenvermögen.

Ein Teil des Vermögens könnte allerdings durch großes Unrecht während der NS-Zeit entstanden sein - das legt ein Bericht der Printausgabe des Magazins ""Bunte“ nahe: Denn die Familie Guttenberg soll an den Enteignungen deutscher Juden kräftig mitverdient haben. Die überlebenden Erben seien dagegen teils leer ausgegangen.

Die Banken seien bei 600 ""Arisierungen“ beteiligt gewesen

Urgroßvater Enoch Buhl Freiherr zu Guttenberg war Miteigentümer von Banken, die offenbar Juden, die im KZ ermordet wurden, enteignen ließen – das würden laut ""Bunte"" mehrere Archivdokumente zeigen.

Enoch Guttenberg ließ sich damals von der reichen Familie Buhl adoptieren, die Mitbegründer der Pfälzischen Hypothekenbank in Ludwigshafen war und Aktien an der Disconto-Gesellschaft hielt.

Dadurch saß Enoch während der Reichsprogromnacht am 9. November 1938 im Aufsichtsrat der Hypothekenbank und in einem regionalen Gremium der Disconto-Gesellschaft, die später in der Deutschen Bank aufging.

Nur drei Tage nach der Reichsprogromnacht beschloss Herrmann Göring die ""Verordnung zur Ausschaltung der Juden aus dem deutschen Wirtschaftsleben“. Die Banken halfen dabei tatkräftig mit, denn sie verdienten bei der Enteignung sogenannte Vermittlungsprovisionen. So seien laut ""Bunte“ die Banken, in deren Kontrollorganen Enoch saß, bei 660 sogenannten ""Arisierungen“ beteiligt gewesen.

Die Hypothekenbank nahm der Familie Klugmann ihr Mietshaus weg

Diese ""Arisierungen“ trafen auch die Familie Klugmann, die ein Mietshaus in Ludwigshafen besaß. Die Pfälzische Hypothekenbank beantragte 1940 eine Zwangsversteigerung des Hauses und sicherte es sich dabei selbst, schreibt das Magazin. Die Besitzer und deren jüngstes Kind waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon von den Nationalsozialisten ermordet worden.

Die beiden älteren Kinder der Familie Klugmann hatten es jedoch geschafft, ins Ausland zu fliehen. Den Kaufpreis zahlte die Bank allerdings nicht den Erben, sondern verrechnete ihn laut der ""Bunten"" mit angeblichen Kosten und Gebühren.

Als Miteigentümer der Hypothekenbank sei Enoch damit nach dem Bericht nicht nur an Enteignungen wie dieser beteiligt gewesen – er habe auch davon profitiert. So konnten sich die Guttenbergs nach dem Ende des zweiten Weltkrieges die Vermögensanteile an den beiden Banken, die sich an den Enteignungen bereichert haben sollen, weiter sichern. Noch 2016 besaß die Familie laut ""Bunte"" Anteile an der Deutschen Bank.

Anders erging es den Erben Sarah und Karl Klugmann: Sie klagten vor der Wiedergutmachungskammer gegen die Hypothekenbank. Obwohl sie in einem Zwischenurteil Recht bekamen, wurde die Zwangsversteigerung schließlich für rechtens erklärt.

""Ich werde prüfen, ob das Unrecht gesühnt werden kann“

Sara sei an dem Urteil zerbrochen und habe sich zurückgezogen, erzählt Karls Enkelin Galia der ""Bunten“. Sie sagte über Karl: ""Er kämpfte fast zwei Jahrzehnte um eine Entschädigung und um die Ehre seiner Eltern und seines Bruders. In seinem Andenken werde ich prüfen, ob unserer Familie Ansprüche zustehen und ob das Unrecht gesühnt werden kann.“

Viele Unternehmen und Banken profitierten von den Enteignungen – einige davon, wie die Familie Quandt, arbeiteten ihre Verstrickungen mit dem NS-Regime und ihren Anteil an dem Leid der Opfer selbst auf. Eine Anfrage der Bunten an die Guttenbergs sei jedoch unbeantwortet geblieben.

La prossima settimana Montecitorio sarà chiamato a votare la proposta di legge a tutela di chi segnala corruzione e illeciti sul posto di lavoro, nel settore pubblico come in quello privato, provvedimento di recente approvato al Senato da un'ampia maggioranza trasversale dopo uno stallo di oltre 600 giorni.

Se alla Camera verrà confermata la stessa composita maggioranza (le forze di governo più Mdp e Sinistra italiana, con l'aggiunta del Movimento 5 Stelle, a cui si deve la proposta), l'Italia potrebbe finalmente dotarsi di una legge che tuteli i whistleblower, presidio fondamentale per prevenire la corruzione sul posto di lavoro. Questo termine inglese, per ora privo di una efficace traduzione in italiano, indica letteralmente chi suona il fischietto (to blow the whistle) segnalando frodi o illeciti a cui assiste sul posto di lavoro.

Nonostante il ruolo importantissimo svolto dai whistleblower nel far emergere corruzione e illegalità, le tutele su cui essi possono contare sono attualmente limitate se non inesistenti. Forme di protezione si rendono indispensabili perché chi segnala illeciti sul posto di lavoro corre il rischio di gravi ritorsioni che vanno dal demansionamento al mobbing fino al licenziamento.

La lunga paralisi al Senato ha se non altro consentito di negoziare un testo migliorato rispetto a quello votato da Montecitorio che, seppur perfezionabile, potrà davvero garantire protezione a chi oggi si espone per segnalare illeciti. Un risultato ottenuto anche grazie alla mobilitazione della società civile che, con la campagna #vocidigiustizia di Riparte il futuro e Transparency International Italia ha portato il whistleblowing sui media e nelle piazze: il 13 settembre le due organizzazioni hanno tenuto una performance davanti al Pantheon, cui ha preso parte anche il presidente dell'Anac Raffaele Cantone, che ha aggiunto la sua firma alle oltre 65.000 raccolte in poco più di un anno.

Il testo emendato dal Senato introduce alcune significative novità: in primis il cosiddetto rovesciamento della prova, per cui sarà a carico del datore di lavoro dimostrare che la ritorsione subita dal lavoratore-whistleblower non è in alcun modo conseguenza della segnalazione. Altro miglioramento, l'eliminazione dal testo del concetto di buona fede: non verrà lasciata al giudice la discrezionalità di valutare la condizione soggettiva (la buona fede) in cui il segnalante ha effettuato la denuncia, bensì solo la validità dell'oggetto della segnalazione. Il focus dovrà quindi essere posto sulla rilevanza dell'informazione portata a conoscenza dal whistleblower e non invece sulle ragioni che lo hanno condotto a segnalare.

Anche il quadro sanzionatorio è stato rivisto: da una parte con l'aumento dell'ammenda amministrativa nei confronti di chi mette in pratica misure discriminatorie nei confronti del segnalante; dall'altra con l'introduzione di un nuovo illecito destinato a colpire, nel settore pubblico, i responsabili anticorruzione che non svolgano le dovute indagini a seguito della segnalazione. Infine, il provvedimento approvato dal Senato ha fatto un passo avanti significativo nel sancire il divieto a rivelare l'identità del segnalante sia nel procedimento disciplinare, sia in quello contabile e penale.

Non è solo l'Italia a rivedere finalmente le proprie leggi in favore dei whistleblower: negli ultimi mesi le istituzioni europee si sono mostrate particolarmente attive nel riconoscere il determinante contributo dei segnalanti nel prevenire la corruzione. Una recente analisi pubblicata dalla Commissione Europea ha dimostrato che nei Paesi che hanno messo in piedi un apparato normativo che tuteli chi segnala illegalità e corruzione i costi sono ben inferiori ai vantaggi economici derivanti dalle segnalazioni stesse.

Lo studio stima infatti in una cifra compresa tra i 5.8 e i 9.6 miliardi di euro i vantaggi potenziali derivanti da una effettiva ed efficace protezione dei whistleblower a livello continentale. Dati tanto più rilevanti considerando un sondaggio dell'Eurobarometro del 2014 secondo il quale ben 3 europei su 4 testimoni di illeciti o corruzione non avrebbero fatto denuncia.

Per rispondere ai giustificati timori di ritorsioni da parte di cittadini potenzialmente onesti, le istituzioni europee stanno cercando di correre ai ripari. A fronte dell'attivismo già da tempo dimostrato dal Parlamento di Strasburgo, ora sembra muoversi anche la Commissione europea, che per la fine del 2017 ha promesso di rendere pubblici i dati di un'analisi continentale che valuti l'impatto di una regolamentazione sulla protezione dei whistleblower estesa a tutti i Paesi membri della Ue. La valutazione d'impatto viene subito dopo una consultazione pubblica lanciata la scorsa primavera che ha ottenuto risultati davvero sorprendenti: oltre 5.000 soggetti hanno partecipato, molti dei quali privati cittadini che considerano evidentemente la protezione dei whistleblower una battaglia prioritaria che l'Unione Europea dovrebbe affrontare presto.

In attesa che la Commissione europea sveli il suo piano, il Parlamento ha votato a maggioranza il 24 ottobre un rapporto che - seppur non vincolante - ribadisce la necessità di una protezione a livello continentale che non riguardi solo specifici ambiti professionali o settori economici, ma che sia orizzontale e tuteli tutti quei lavoratori che oggi, facendo il loro dovere nell'interesse pubblico, rischiano di subire torti e ritorsioni.

Un'indagine condotta da Demopolis per Riparte il futuro a settembre 2017 conferma su scala nazionale quanto già emerso a livello europeo: il 52% degli italiani fra i 18 e i 40 anni ritiene la tutela del dipendente pubblico o privato che segnala illeciti sul posto di lavoro uno degli strumenti più importanti per prevenire e combattere la corruzione. Il 51% dei soggetti intervistati dichiara inoltre che denuncerebbe sicuramente un tentativo di corruzione alle forze dell'ordine, mentre il 30% lo farebbe probabilmente: appare chiaro come una legge a tutela dei whistleblower creerebbe i presupposti per fare emergere sempre di più i casi di corruzione e per creare una cultura della legalità diffusa.",Proteggere chi segnala la corruzione in Europa vale più di 5 miliardi di euro,http://www.huffingtonpost.it/federico-anghela-/proteggere-chi-segnala-la-corruzione-in-europa-vale-piu-di-5-miliardi-di-euro_a_23268005/

Que révèlent les ""Paradise papers""?

Cette nouvelle enquête du Consortium international des journalistes d'investigation (ICIJ) s'appuie sur la fuite de 13,5 millions de documents, provenant notamment d'un cabinet international d'avocats basé aux Bermudes, Appleby. Elle détaille les dispositifs et les circuits planétaires d'optimisation fiscale permettant aux particuliers fortunés et aux entreprises de ne pas payer d'impôt.

Parmi les noms cités figurent la reine Elizabeth II, le ministre américain au Commerce Wilbur Ross, ou des multinationales telles que Apple ou Nike.

Plus encore que les ""Panama papers"" qui braquaient les projecteurs sur des dispositifs illégaux, cette enquête montre que ""les riches contribuables et les entreprises s'arrangent avec les différents paradis fiscaux, pour échapper de manière industrielle à l'impôt"", souligne Lison Rehbinder, chargée de plaidoyer Financement du développement au CCFD-Terre Solidaire.

Quels sont les mécanismes utilisés?

Dans ces documents, le recours à des ""sociétés offshore"" apparaît régulièrement. Il s'agit de sociétés enregistrées à l'étranger, mais qui à la différence des filiales internationales d'entreprises, n'exercent aucune activité économique dans le pays où elles sont domiciliées.

L'utilisation de structures intermédiaires, comme les ""trusts"" (permettant de déléguer la gestion de ses actifs à une personne de confiance) ou les sociétés ""prête-noms"" (permettant de dissimuler l'identité du bénéficiaire réel), apparaît quant à elle comme quasi systématique.

Le point commun de ces différentes structures, c'est ""l'opacité"", souligne Lucas Chancel, co-directeur du Laboratoire sur les inégalités mondiales à la Paris School of Economics (PSE), qui décrit des organisations ""en cascade"", avec des mécanismes ""extrêmement complexes et sophistiqués"".

Des circuits qui privent les finances publiques de montants colossaux: selon les calculs effectués pour l'ICIJ par l'économiste Gabriel Zucman, professeur à l'université de Berkeley en Californie, l'évasion fiscale des entreprises et des grandes fortunes engendrerait près de 350 milliards d'euros de pertes fiscales par an aux Etats du monde entier.

Est-ce illégal?

""On est clairement dans le domaine de la faille juridique"", déclare Lucas Chancel, qui estime que les faits décrits dans les Paradise Papers relèvent avant tout de stratégies ""d'optimisation fiscale"", se jouant des zones grises du droit international.

Tout le monde, en effet, a le droit de créer une société offshore, du moment que les profits sont déclarés. Même si généralement, ce type de société est créé dans des Etats où la fiscalité est particulièrement avantageuse, dans ce que l'on appelle les ""paradis fiscaux"".

""Les Panama papers étaient le scandale de l'illégalité"", a souligné Pascal Saint-Amans, directeur du Centre de politique et d'administration fiscales de l'OCDE, interrogé sur France Inter. Avec les Paradise papers, ""on est dans quelque chose de plus raffiné, de plus distingué, de plus élaboré, on est sur des schémas légaux"".

Où en est-on de la lutte contre ce phénomène?

Depuis la crise financière de 2008, plusieurs initiatives ont été mises en place, notamment sous l'égide de l'OCDE: fin septembre, l'échange automatique d'informations bancaires est ainsi entré en vigueur dans 50 pays.

Pour Lucas Chancel, on est malgré tout ""encore loin du compte"". ""L'échange d'information va à l'encontre des intérêts d'un certain nombre d'acteurs"", explique-t-il. ""Cela ne peut se faire de manière efficace que s'il y a une réelle contrainte"".

Les ONG appellent pour leur part les gouvernements à des actions plus résolues, alors que les révélations de type ""Offshore Leaks"", ""Lux Leaks"" et autres ""Malta Files"" se succèdent dans la presse depuis quatre ans. ""Des mesures doivent être prises dès maintenant pour agir en établissant une liste noire des paradis fiscaux et en imposant la transparence pour que l'on sache clairement si les sociétés et les grandes entreprises payent leur juste part d'impôt"", a estimé dans un communiqué Manon Aubry, porte-parole d'Oxfam France.

Lison Rehbinder, de CCFD, plaide pour obliger les multinationales à publier leurs données financières pays par pays, une mesure censurée par le Conseil constitutionnel fin 2016. Elle appelle aussi à lutter contre la ""concurrence fiscale"" entre les Etats.

Das ändert sich allerdings gerade, was nicht zuletzt auf Bücher wie „Das geheime Leben der Bäume"", „Gebrauchsanweisung für den Wald"", „Das geheime Netzwerk der Natur"" des schreibenden Försters Peter Wohlleben zurückzuführen ist. Wälder sind für ihn nicht nur „Holzfabriken und Rohstofflager"", sondern auch Lebensräume für viele Tier- und Pflanzenarten, die miteinander verwoben und voneinander abhängig sind. Immer, wenn sie sich artgerecht entfalten können, bieten sie Schutz und Erholung. Mit seinem Engagement setzt er ein hoffnungsvolles Zeichen für die Zukunft, dass das geheime Leben der Wälder und der Bäume weiterhin stattfindet und auch unsere Nachfahren noch staunend zwischen den Bäumen spazieren können.

Der Aufenthalt in der Natur verbessert die Stimmung und entlastet die Atemwege. Deshalb ist es wichtig, in die Stadtbebauung mehr Grün zu integrieren - das beeinflusst positiv Herzschlag und das vegetative Nervensystem. „Es geht dabei nicht um Sauerstoff, sondern offensichtlich um einen Reiz, der unser vegetatives Nervensystem runterfahren lässt"", sagt Peter Falkei, Direktor der Klinik und Poliklinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie am Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in München. Wenn man durch einen Wald geht, werden die neuronalen Netze „heruntergefahren"". Er vermutet, dass dies mit einem Gefühl von Geborgenheit zu tun hat, einem Schutz vor Lärm und Stress. Auch regenerieren sich Hirnareale, die zuständig für Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration sind, während eines Spaziergangs, der uns hilft, wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu kommen in der Schräglage der Welt.

Städte machen nervöser und lassen Menschen schlechter schlafen. Auch Lichtverschmutzung ist ein enormes Gesundheitsrisiko. Im Gehirn kommen die beiden Schaltstellen Mandelkern und Cingulum ins Spiel: Der Mandelkern reagiert auf Dinge, die er nicht kennt und nicht verorten kann; das Cingulum macht den Relevanzcheck: Ist etwas wichtig für die eigene Person oder nicht? Aktuelle Studien belegen, dass beide bei Menschen, die in Städten mit mehr als 100.000 Einwohnern aufwachsen, aktiver sind, was zu einer Grundunruhe der Städter führt, „einer Art unproduktiven Aufmerksamkeit"" (Falkei). Meistens sind Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen auf private Stressfaktoren und berufliche Probleme zurückzuführen.

Viele Menschen greifen dann auf Antidepressiva zurück. Laut Depressionsatlas der deutschen Techniker Krankenkasse hat sich zwischen 2000 und 2013 die verschriebene Tagesmenge an Antidepressiva verdreifacht. 2015 zahlten die gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen dafür rund 750 Millionen Euro an die Pharmaindustrie.

Statt auf Medikamente zu setzen verordnen Ärzte in Japan ihren Patienten Waldtherapien, denn bewusstes Gehen durch den Wald ist gesundheitsfördernd. Inzwischen hat der Trend auch Deutschland erreicht. Auf Usedom darf sich seit September 2017 ein Wald „Kur- und Heilwald"" nennen.

Für 94 Prozent der erwachsenen Deutschen gehören die Natur und insbesondere der Wald zu einem guten Leben. Das ist das Ergebnis einer Studie des Bundesamtes für Naturschutz (BfN) zum Naturbewusstsein der Deutschen, die 2016 erschien. Die Nähe zur Natur ist mit einer größeren Lebenszufriedenheit verbunden.

Bäume haben bis heute nur deshalb überlebt, weil sie eine enorme (Widerstands-)Kraft bzw. Resilienz und genetische Vielfalt innerhalb einer Art aufweisen. „Fest und stark ist nur der Baum, der unablässig Winden ausgesetzt war, denn im Kampf festigen und verstärken sich seine Wurzeln"", schrieb schon der römische Philosoph Seneca. Wo sich Bäume wieder erneuern, erleben sich auch die Menschen als selbst regulierendes Prinzip. Bäume, die bis heute einzigartig sind, dienten den Menschen als Heiligtum, als Nahrungs- und Inspirationsquelle. Prominente Baumliebhaber waren Goethe, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Bismarck, Hermann Hesse, Kurt Tucholsky, Winston Churchill, Ruth Maria Kubitschek oder Michael Gorbatschow.

Der Wald hat heute neben der Holzproduktion seine größte Bedeutung im Klimaschutz - nämlich die (über)lebensnotwendige CO2-Sequestrierung. Deshalb muss eine nachhaltige Optimierung zwischen der Holzproduktion und der Klimawirkung gesucht werden. Viele große private Waldbesitzer in Deutschland haben (häufig im Gegensatz zu den Staatsforsten) seit langem einen hohen Holzvorrat im Wald angestrebt. Damit verbunden ist die Befolgung einer dynamischen Nachhaltigkeitsregel (Holz + CO2-Sequestrierung). In absehbarer Zukunft muss viel weniger Holz geschlagen werden, denn für den Klimaschutz ist es zwingend, die Biomasse im Wald mindestens bis ins Jahr 2150 so hoch wie möglich anwachsen zu lassen.

Der Begriff Nachhaltigkeit kommt aus der Forstwirtschaft und bezeichnet die Nutzung eines regenerierbaren Systems, so dass es in seinen wesentlichen Eigenschaften erhalten bleibt und sich auf natürliche Weise erneuern kann. Der US-amerikanische Songwriter, Country- und Folk-Sänger Songwriter John Denver gründete die Organisation „Plant It 2000"" zur Wiederaufforstung hunderttausender Bäume, der Unternehmer und Umweltaktivist Douglas Tompkins, Gründer und ehemaliger Chef der Textilmarken The North Face und Esprit Holdings Limited, kaufte ein großes Gebiet in Argentinien und Chile auf, um Nationalparks zu schaffen. Und der ehemalige Chefdirigent der Berliner Philharmoniker Claudio Abbado ermöglichte mit zwei Konzerthonoraren die Anpflanzung von 90.000 Bäumen in seiner Heimatstadt Mailand.

In seinem Privatgarten am Landsitz Highgrove spricht Prinz Charles regelmäßig mit seinen Bäumen und behandelt sie fast wie Persönlichkeiten. Zudem setzt er sich seit Jahrzehnten mit seinen Stiftungen für Naturschutz und Artenvielfalt ein.

Als der Reformator Martin Luther im April 1539 in seinem Garten die Bäume betrachtete, sprach er: „Gelobt sei Gott, der Schöpfer, der aus toten verstorbenen Kreaturen im Lenz alles wieder lebendig macht!"" Er liebte Bäume aber nicht nur wegen ihrer Erhabenheit und Schönheit, sondern auch wegen ihres nachhaltigen Nutzens. Sein berühmter Satz „Wenn ich wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, würde ich heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen."", lässt sich zwar nicht belegbar nachweisen, weil der erste schriftliche Nachweis erst in einem Rundbrief der hessischen Kirche aus dem Jahre 1944 zu finden ist - dennoch wäre diese Aussage sicher in seinem Sinne gewesen.

Ein immerwährender Neuanfang.

“Call It What You Want” is a soft love song that talks about being completely lost in a romance. Swift teased the song’s release on her social media Thursday with a snippet of the lyrics, sending all of her fans into yet another tailspin. The 27-year-old pop star has dropped four singles and two music videos since announcing her sixth studio album, which will be released Nov. 10.

“I’m doing better than I ever was, ’cause my baby’s fit like a daydream walking with his head down,” Swift sings. “I’m the one he’s walking to, so call it what you want, yeah call it what you want to.”

This latest single from Swift has softer tones than her previous singles, which all took on an electronic pop feel. “Call It What You Want” is a melodic ballad that will have you feeling like you’re falling head over heels all over again.

“And I know I make the same mistakes every time, bridges burned, I never learn. At least I did one thing right,” the lyrics continue. “I did one thing right.”

Yes, we’ll take a million more of these beautiful lyrics, please.

“Look What You Made Me Do,” the first single off Swift’s new album, shattered streaming records on Spotify in less than 24 hours. Since then, the singer has dropped singles “Ready for It” and “Gorgeous” in addition to “Call It What You Want.” Each of her other songs has showcased a new sound for Swift, digging into the trend of new pop music. The singer has gotten both criticism and praise for her new sound and attitude.

But as always, Swifties were up late holding out for the newest single and posting their roller-coaster emotions to Twitter.

In lieu of endorsing weight-loss teas and hitting every D-list red carpet going - choices that Camilla is careful not to judge or look down on, we should add - she headed straight to Greece with former co-star Jamie Jewitt, to lend her hand to helping refugees. She later joined the cast of HuffPost UK original series ‘New Activists’, documenting her recent trip to the site of the former jungle camp in Calais, alongside Help Refugees.

HuffPost UK Camilla Thurlow

HuffPost UK recently caught up with the former bomb disposal worker about how ‘New Activists’ felt the like the right fit for her, why the refugee crisis means so much and what it’s like breaking the reality TV star mould... What made you want to get involved with ‘New Activists’? Having seen the other ‘New Activists’ and what they’d been working on, you could see that it was really opening people’s eyes to a whole different side of activism. Like, it was humanising the people involved. In some instances there’s been a bit of a stigma attached to activism, and people would consider activists to be only a certain type of person. But actually this documentary series has really given an insight into the fact it’s just about normal people who feel very strongly, and there’s so many different sides to that person. It’s all about big ideas but with very real people. People know you best from ‘Love Island’, and after being on a show like that, you get a lot of offers. How did you decide what to do next? I think it’s all about authenticity, really, on that side of things, and I know what I think I’m good at, and it tends to be stuff that I feel passionately about. If I’m going to do something, I like to do it justice. For me it was just important to find the right thing, and also to try and make sure that I was using any platform that I might have to raise awareness for certain issues that I don’t think necessarily always get seen. It’s that thing, interestingly, of different horses for different courses. I have so much admiration for the other things that people have done, and this seemed like the right opportunity for me. On ‘Love Island’, we saw how much you wanted to do more activism. Did you ever worry that being on a show like that would limit your options? Of course there were concerns in my mind in terms of going back to the work that I did before, and I think obviously it’s always worth having those concerns and having a healthy level of worry about what you’re going to do next, because it makes you stay on the right track. So I guess I was worried to an extent, but I think it was the same for all of us who were in it from the beginning. When we came out we just didn’t realise how successful the series had been, and how successful it had been across so many different demographics. It was really a very diverse audience and… I think there was definitely something in the timing, this summer was quite an interesting time on many different levels with domestic and foreign politics, and somehow in that. ‘Love Island’ became this really engaging escapism. So I’ll say that I did have concerns, but in the same way I would have had concerns about many different things and how that could affect my work.

ITV Camilla and her 'Love Island' co-stars this summer

Do you hope that your involvement in ‘Love Island’ and ‘New Activists’ can possibly inspire a new breed of celebrities who start on reality shows? I think the thing is, it’s really interesting because I feel like there are comparisons being drawn that aren’t as clear as it might appear. I don’t feel as different [to other reality stars] as sometimes people perceive it. I’m struggling to explain myself, but I think it’s very easy to label someone as a “typical reality TV star” but that person will have many other sides to them. The only thing that I sort of hope will happen is that... if I can raise any awareness of the issues that are important to me, that will make me very happy. What is it about the refugee crisis in particular that spoke to you? I think part of it comes from my previous work, pre- ‘Love Island’. When you go to an area where there’s been a conflict and you can see people have been forced to leave their homes behind, and then you’re involved in trying to make the area safe so they can come back… you start to think about what it must mean for that person. To have literally got to a point where they had no choice but to leave, but also what growing up against that backdrop of violence can do to a person. Also, because I was on the EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] side, I wasn’t seeing much of the people who had been forced to leave, so it was really important to me to build up that whole picture of what the results of conflict are. So, I initially took the trip to Greece with Jamie [Jewitt, her boyfriend and fellow ‘Love Island’ star] and that was certainly an eye-opener, from that point on we just realised how much we could be doing to help people, and i just wanted to be a part of that. So how did your trip to Calais come about? I spoke to Josie [Naughton], who’s the co-founder of Help Refugees about supporting them. It’s been a year since the demolition of the Jungle camp in Calais, and since then, people have been homeless, living rough - not that they had homes before, but there was some form of camp, some form of protection, and they are now completely exposed. And that includes a number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping rough, completely unprotected, no one to stop anything happening to them. The more I discussed it with her, the more I realised first of all that I needed to see it for myself, and secondly that I wanted to be a part of trying to highlight the fact that there is a legal route for these children to come here, there is a safe way and that needs to happen urgently. Especially now it’s coming up to winter. In the year since the jungle camp closed, how has the situation in Calais changed? I think it’s worse, for the people who are there at the moment. It would be wrong for me to draw any sort of straight of judgement, because I didn’t see it before. But we spoke to a gentleman called Stu in the distribution centre, and he had been in the jungle camp, and he said for him the conditions are worse. Now, they’re not even allowed tents to sleep in, so now they get a sleeping bag and a blanket at best, and even those are often taken away by the police, so the conditions are really really bad. In terms of keeping track of people, in making sure that they haven’t been hurt or harmed, that they haven’t attempted to cross and then not made it back and they’re stranded somewhere on their own, it’s just so much harder when there’s no formalised systems.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia. The magnitude of this latest Rohingya refugee crisis may be comparable to two other acute refugee crises this subcontinent saw in the past.

First was the massive human relocation following the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947, and the next was the refugee exodus to India during the 1971 Bangladesh war. The exodus of Afghans into Pakistan is another massive but a more steady, long-standing process.

Among these, India was both a victim and the host during the first one and a gracious host during the second one. During the first refugee crisis, India was a newborn state, during the second one it was a young 'third world' developing democracy. Fifty years elapsed since the second refugee crisis, when the major Rohingya refugee crisis developed. And last 50 years have changed India.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now. To the Western developed states, India is the face and gateway to South Asia. It seems the world elites and the Western democracies have outsourced the job stabilising the region to India. In this changed scenario, it's essential to assess and evaluate India's performance in the Rohingya refugee crisis.

While India's expected role was to play a neutral arbitrator and a stabilising force to contain the crisis, it clearly failed to do so. Although under pressure from the friendly government of Bangladesh, India has later tried to take a less one-sided stand, its continued position has been to take the Myanmar side in this conflict and undermine the ethnic cleansing and the massive humanitarian crisis that was fermenting in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner.

By failing to take the anticipated role of a neutral mediator in this crisis, India failed itself, its people as well as many others who want to see India play the role of a 'grown-up' in this part of the world. India, in sharp contrast to its arch-rival Pakistan, rightfully projects itself as an exceedingly diverse society and tolerant democracy with basic human rights, religious freedom and freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. But, in taking the wrong side of the genocidal anti-democratic forces in Myanmar, India betrayed its own creed and fundamental constitutional philosophy.

India failed its values

India definitely sees Myanmar as a neighbour of high economic and strategic potential. It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner. And this narrow economic interest may have forced India to shun its broader 'regional superpower' aspiration, at least in the case of Bangladesh and Myanmar. India has made a conscious decision to abandon its closer neighbour Bangladesh with a friendly government to court a distant neighbour Myanmar, which is more likely to pick China as its economic and strategic partner.

If Myanmar can get its way removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religion will be the next targets.

The present government of Bangladesh took an immense political risk and spent almost all its remaining political capital in giving in to every single demand India had. Bangladesh paid heed to India's security concerns and did all it could to ensure India's security. Now when Bangladesh is under a serious security threat caused by this influx of refugees, it naturally expected India to stand beside her. But now, to pursue its own narrow interests, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the bus.

Another problem with India's pro-Myanmar stand is that the populations those are being persecuted in Myanmar are people of subcontinental ethnic heritage. Basically, the Rohingyas are people of mostly Bangladeshi origin who have lived in the Arakan region of Myanmar for centuries. The main reason they are being persecuted, ethnically cleansed and killed is the fact that they don't look like their neighbours of 'Bamar' ethnicity, the main ethnic group that makes up Myanmar's population. They look like they are from the Indian subcontinent, and they have very distinct east Indian culture. The common slur the non-Rohingya Rakhines use to denote the Rohingya is the term 'Kala (black)', alluding to the darker skin colour of the Rohingyas.

Among the refugee camps in Bangladesh, there are Rohingya of Hindu denomination along with overwhelming majority Muslims. And there is a reason that reports of Hindu-Rohingya persecution are being staged and widely publicised by Myanmar authorities, for now, Myanmar Junta wants to project the issue as a Buddhist-Muslim communal issue. But if Myanmar can get its way, removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religions will be the next targets.

There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion.

Most of the Rohingyas are from the Muslim minority in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. One reason the Rohingyas are so helpless is the fact that they are Muslims.

A group of Muslims, mainly under the banner of terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, have done despicable things over the last two decades. Their brutality on innocent people all over the world and the gruesome way they publicised these acts made it clear that they wanted to earn global hatred and fear. Beheading innocent captives on camera, photos of them burning people alive, photos of suicide/truck bombs got them what they wanted. The world hates them. The problem is they pulled the whole religion down too. Over 1 billion Muslims are now seen by the rest of the world, reasonably so, with suspicion, unease, and sometimes fear.

Hate always follows fear

India's PM and current policymakers are probably blinded by the fact that the Rohingya victims are Muslims, i.e. 'terrorists'. The Indian foreign policy establishment and PM Modi probably did not see the humanitarian side of the brutal ethnic cleansing, and the genocide-proportion persecution — all they are seeing is an influx of 'potential terrorists'. There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that the Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion. Failing to contain the events leading to this tragedy that has fallen on a marginal Muslim population, India risks creating a goldmine for future terrorist recruits in its backyard.

If political advisors of PM Modi hope that a successful expulsion of Bengali-speaking Rohingyas from Myanmar will be a prelude to do similar thing from the Indian states neighbouring Bangladesh, their political acumen must be short-sighted. Neither India nor Myanmar would benefit from a chaotic festering refugee crisis in a country located between them.

For PM Modi, it is a missed opportunity to claim his stature as the first 21st-century statesman of India. And for India, the continued plight of the Rohingyas is a testament against the claim that India is the regional superpower and stabilising factor in South Asia. While India approvingly watches over the unabated ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, it fails people of its own ethnic heritage too.

Downing Street said on Sunday evening that Pincher had also “voluntarily stood down” from the Whips’ Office.

The Tamworth MP has been accused of acting like a “pound shop Harvey Weinstein”.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Story said in 2001 Pincher had untucked his shirt, massaged his neck and told him: “You’ll go far in the Conservative Party.”

Pincher told the newspaper: “I do not recognise either the events or the interpretation placed on them by The Mail on Sunday.

“Whatever may or may not have happened or been said was obviously many years before I became an MP. If Mr Story has ever felt offended by anything I said then I can only apologise to him.​”

Pincher’s resignation from the Whip’s Office comes amid denials that the party enforcers have a secret “black book” detailing sexual assaults by MPs.

Amber Rudd told the BBC on Sunday she had seen no evidence that the party was covering up abuse. “I was a Whip myself and I don’t recognise some of those more lurid stories that are told about the sort of things Whips knew and did,” she said.

The Home Secretary also revealed that the investigation into Damian Green, the first secretary of state, would be expanded to include allegations pornography was found on computers in his parliamentary office in 2008. Green denies the accusations.

Tory MP Anna Soubry told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme Theresa May should call in the Whips and find out what information they have on MPs.

“All the stuff that they know must be given to the Prime Minister and we must do things properly, and not behind the scenes, in some instances covering up, which is totally unacceptable,” she said.

Also on Sunday, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski was referred to the party’s disciplinary committee.

He faces allegations he pressured a young woman who worked in parliament into meeting a wealthy businessman. Kawczynski denies anything inappropriate took place.

Tory MP Dan Poulter is under investigation following allegations he behaved inappropriately towards women in Westminster. He denies the allegations.

CATALOGNE - Le président catalan destitué Carles Puigdemont et ses quatre conseillers ont été laissés en liberté, sous conditions, par la justice belge, dans l'attente de l'examen des mandats d'arrêt européens émis par l'Espagne à leur encontre, après s'être rendus d'eux-mêmes à la police dimanche.

Conformément aux réquisitions du parquet de Bruxelles, un juge d'instruction a laissé libres les cinq Catalans, après une journée d'audition qui s'est poursuivie tard dans la soirée.

Puigdemont et ses conseillers (ministres) ont interdiction de quitter le territoire belge, doivent avoir une adresse fixe, et devront se présenter ""personnellement"" à toute convocation de la justice et de la police. L'avocat de Puigdemont, qui a quitté les locaux du parquet de Bruxelles vers 23H45, n'a fait aucun commentaire.

Il revient maintenant à une autre juridiction, la Chambre du conseil, de se prononcer sur l'exécution du mandat d'arrêt, dans les 15 prochains jours.

""Prêt à collaborer pleinement avec la justice belge""

Carles Puigdemont et les quatre membres du gouvernement catalan déchu se sont rendus d'eux-mêmes au siège de la police fédérale, dimanche peu après 09H00.

""Nous avions des contacts réguliers avec les avocats des cinq personnes et il avait été convenu un rendez-vous au commissariat"", a expliqué Gilles Dejemeppe, substitut du procureur du Roi et porte-parole du parquet de Bruxelles lors d'une conférence de presse. ""Ils ont honoré ce rendez-vous"", a-t-il ajouté.

Un peu plus d'un mois après le référendum d'autodétermination interdit du 1er octobre, les cinq Catalans ont été officiellement informés des mandats, qu'ils ont pu consulter avec leurs avocats afin de prendre connaissance des faits reprochés par la justice espagnole: sédition, rébellion et détournement de fonds.

Le chef séparatiste catalan avait écrit sur Twitter samedi qu'il était ""prêt à collaborer pleinement avec la justice belge"".

""Je vais aller à la justice mais à la vraie justice""

Le mandat d'arrêt européen a été créé pour faciliter l'extradition entre Etats membres, mais une procédure judiciaire probablement assez longue devrait cependant s'ouvrir. Puigdemont et son avocat ont en effet déjà annoncé leur volonté de s'opposer à ce mandat.

""Je vais aller à la justice mais à la vraie justice"", avait déclaré à la télévision belge RTBF Carles Puigdemont, pour qui il n'existe pas à Madrid les garanties d'une ""sentence juste, indépendante qui puisse échapper à cette énorme pression, à cette énorme influence de la politique sur le pouvoir judiciaire en Espagne"".

Un porte-parole de son parti politique, le PDeCAT, a souligné depuis l'Espagne l'attitude ""volontaire"" de Puigdemont qui dénote la volonté ""de se défendre dans un procès juste et impartial, possible en Belgique, hautement improbable en Espagne"".

Selon la loi, une décision sur l'exécution du mandat d'arrêt européen doit être prise dans les 60 jours suivant l'arrestation de la personne visée. Mais si tous les délais et recours sont utilisés au maximum des possibilités, la procédure peut prendre jusqu'à trois mois, a rappelé le ministère belge de la Justice dans un communiqué.

""The single-family home and plex markets are becoming increasingly favourable to sellers, as selling times for these property categories are falling,"" said Mathieu Cousineau, president of the Greater Montreal Real Estate Board.

Single family homes sold last month were on the market on average for 78 days, almost two weeks less than a year ago.

Buildings with two to five units sold three days quicker at 81 days. Condominiums took the longest to sell at 103 days, but that was 17 days fewer than in October 2016. That signals a balanced condo market, said Cousineau.

Most active October in eight years

The number of homes sold in the month increased seven per cent to 3,270, led by a 13 per cent increase in condo sales and three per cent for single homes.

Last month was the most active October in eight years, the real estate board said.

The strong activity came ahead of the federal government's plans to tighten mortgage requirements.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will implement new lending guidelines at the beginning of next year. Among the changes being considered is a requirement that homebuyers who do not require mortgage insurance still have to show they can make their payments if interest rates rise.

Paul Cardinal of the Quebec Federation of Real Estate Boards has attributed monthly housing gains this year to strong job creation, consumer confidence and foreign migration.

Dans sa dernière édition, parue mercredi, l'hebdomadaire satirique représente le théologien le pantalon déformé par un énorme sexe en érection, et proclamant: ""Je suis le 6e pilier de l'islam"". ""VIOL La défense de Tariq Ramadan"", peut-on lire au-dessus du dessin signé Juin.

Cette Une vaut (une nouvelle fois) à Charlie Hebdo des centaines de menaces de mort. Soutenons-les et diffusons-la. pic.twitter.com/wd2YIkhgE7 — Hugo Clément (@hugoclement) 4 novembre 2017

Interrogé sur l'angle choisi pour ce dessin, Riss a fait valoir, sur Europe 1, que Tariq Ramadan se présentait lui-même comme ""un islamologue, comme un sachant"", c'est pourquoi le dessin fait référence au ""6e pilier de l'islam (....), le jihad"".

Les cinq piliers de l'islam constituent le fondement du mode de vie islamique: la profession de foi, la prière, la zakat (l'aumône), le jeûne du mois de Ramadan et le pèlerinage à la Mecque une fois dans la vie pour ceux qui en ont les moyens. Le jihad est considéré comme le sixième pilier de l'islam par une minorité au sein du sunnisme bien qu'il n'en ait pas le statut officiel.

Sur les messages de haine et les menaces adressées à Charlie Hebdo, Riss a déclaré qu'ils n'ont ""jamais vraiment cessé"". ""Mais c'est vrai que parfois, il y a des pics où on reçoit sur les réseaux sociaux des menaces de mort explicites: c'est le cas une fois de plus"", a-t-il ajouté. ""C'est toujours difficile de savoir si ce sont des menaces sérieuses ou pas, mais par principe, on les prend au sérieux et on dépose plainte"", a-t-il dit.

""On n'accepte pas d'être traité de cette manière-là. Il y a une ligne rouge à ne pas franchir"", a poursuivi Riss. ""Menacer de mort quelqu'un, ce n'est ni autorisé dans la rue, ni dans un journal, ni nulle part, c'est 'poursuivable'"", a-t-il ajouté, déplorant ces ""bouffées de haine"".

""Au-delà du sérieux de ces menaces de mort, c'est une question de climat"", a souligné le dessinateur. Il juge ""étonnant qu'après tout ce qui s'est passé depuis 2, 3, 4 ans, il y ait encore des réactions aussi violentes, des appels au meurtre"". ""Ce n'est pas simplement de la contestation ou de la discussion, ce n'est même pas de l'injure, c'est au-delà de ça: c'est que maintenant, ça s'est banalisé d'appeler au meurtre"", déclare-t-il. C'est ""assez inquiétant"" et ""révèle un climat assez lourd"", estime-t-il.

Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova says President Donald Trump is not so different from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

In an interview Friday night with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, the founder of the Russian punk rock group, which often criticises Putin, said both leaders were intent on ""eroding"" their respective nations' institutions.

""I think they make us forget that citizenship is not just using things that your government is giving to you but giving back to your government and protecting those institutions like democracy,"" Tolokonnikova said.

The two presidents also share similar views about their critics and the media, she added.

""I've seen how badly it can turn. I've seen it, in front of my eyes, for the last 17 years, and I hear it from Donald Trump the same words about media that Putin was using for 17 years,"" said Tolokonnikova. ""That it's fake news, that are paid by foreign governments and whoever.""

Tolokonnikova also claimed that Trump's supposed lack of any true political beliefs played perfectly into Putin's hands.

""He's (Trump) really concerned with himself, with his fame and his wealth. And that's perfectly understandable for Putin as a (former) KGB agent,"" she said. ""He knows how to deal with people who are easy to understand or easy to bribe.""

The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the Queen, was found to have millions of pounds invested in offshore arrangements.

Around £10m from the Queen’s private fund was paid into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda between 2004 and 2005, according to the so-called Paradise Papers leak.

Corbyn suggested the Queen’s finances should fall within the scope of an investigation into the leak.

Asked on Monday if the Queen should apologise, Corbyn said:

“Anyone that is putting money into tax havens in order to avoid taxation in Britain, and obviously investigations have to take place, should do two things: not just apologise for it but also recognise what it does to our society. “If a very wealthy person wants to avoid taxation in Britain and therefore put money into a tax haven somewhere, who loses? Schools, hospitals, housing, all those public services lose and the rest of the population have to pay to cover up the deficit created by that.”

A spokesman for the Labour leader said Corbyn did not mean the Queen should say sorry herself.

“Jeremy did not call for the Queen to apologise, but said anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should, and that they should recognise the damage done by avoidance to society,” the spokesman said.

Later he told Bloomberg TV there should be “an inquiry into all the revelations about the Paradise Papers”.

Asked if that included the Queen, Mr Corbyn replied: “Everybody. The Royal Household are subject to taxation. I don’t know what has happened in that case. These issues all must be part of that.”

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

Christmas can be a time for indulgence, but eating, drinking and making merry can cause you to seriously pile on the pounds over the course of a few short weeks. In fact, on average people gain between one and five lbs (0.5-2.5kg). And, you only need to take in 500 additional calories (kcals) a day over five weeks to see the scales register an extra 5lbs. 500 kcals may sound a lot but it doesn't take much; just a glass of homemade mulled wine (271 kcals) and a minced pie (246 kcals). But, don't despair, eating, drinking and being healthy this festive season doesn't mean that you have to compromise on fun:

Start the day with a healthy breakfast. It's easy to miss this important meal, or indulge to ease your Christmas party hangover. But, eating a good breakfast - protein rich smoked salmon or a bowl of wholegrain porridge topped with fresh berries and a swirl of a sugar-free liquid sweetener like SPLENDA® ZERO (if you like a little extra sweetness, without extra calories) - will help kick start your metabolism and keep you feeling full.

Get creative with advent. Even big kids love opening those little advent calendar doors - it's the perfect excuse to eat chocolate daily (and at breakfast!) till Christmas. But, enjoying 25 days of chocolaty goodness will do your waistline no favours! A little chocolate Xmas character provides around 26 kcals, 1.5g fat, 2.8g sugar - even more if they are truffle or alcoholic filled - that's an extra 650 kcals, 37.5g fat and 70g sugar over 25 days! Why not get creative with your countdown, instead?

Love seasonal fruit and veg. With the abundance of festive food, it can be easy to forget the basics of eating healthily and achieving the (at least) 5-a-day recommendation. Include at least two servings of fruit and three servings of veg each day, and I like to pile the veg on my plate first, rather than last. That means less room for calorie-dense, nutrient-lacking treats.

Make time for exercise. However well you plan, life is going to get hectic over the festive period, so schedule your 2.5 hours of moderate intensity exercise into your week now. Exercise is also a fabulous stress buster, as it releases endorphins, making you feel happier and calmer.

Don't skip meals. If you're going to the office party straight after work, or you've got a dinner date, don't ditch lunch for fear of overdoing the calories. You'll be famished and hungry people tend to make bad food decisions.

Try not to burn the candle at both ends. We cram in so much over the festive period, going out during the week and hosting family and friends at the weekends; not always giving our body the rest it needs to recuperate! Too little sleep can reduce the level of the appetite controlling hormone leptin and increase the hormone ghrelin, telling the brain you need to eat - and not always the right healthy food choices. Pace yourself!

Rethink tea breaks. Cutting down on the 'white stuff' is a tall order for anyone with a sweet tooth, especially around Christmas; an easy win are your tea breaks! Instead of adding sugar to your tea, swap to a low-calorie sweetener, like SPLENDA®. If you drink four cups of tea a day with two teaspoons (8g) of sugar in each that adds up to 128 kcals. Your sweet tea also tots up to nearly one 1kg bag of sugar over the 25 days of December and 3,200 kcals!

Be mindful. The key to a healthy diet is moderation, so allow yourself to indulge on occasion with a bit of what you fancy. But, do it mindfully; eat slowly and savour the taste, smell and texture of food, rather than mindlessly picking.

Keep calm. Christmas can be one of the most stressful times of the year - the expense of gifts and food, the pressure of shopping and the expectations can play havoc with your digestive system and health; where possible try to plan to minimise stress levels.

Treat sweets as treats. Everyone knows how hard it can be to eat healthily around Christmas. The constant supply of treats from guests and savoury snacks at work can be too tempting. Keep healthier seasonal snacks, like clementines, to hand; a medium clementine has just 25 kcals and will provide you 31% of your daily needs for immune boosting vitamin C and 1g of gut healthy fibre.

Wise-up to the buffet. Faced with a buffet, resist the temptation to start filling your plate at one end of the table and continuing to add to it until you reach the other! With such variety, portion control can be difficult; before you pick up the plate (always take the smallest!), pause and prioritise healthy choices. Choose fresh king prawns, smoked salmon, slices of lean ham and vegetable crudité. Now, step away.

Monitor portion size. The bigger your tableware, the more you'll fill it; research shows that downsizing from a 12 to 10-inch plate could help you eat roughly 22% fewer calories, and you'll not feel like you're missing out because you're getting a plateful! Christmas is the time to put away your plus-sized plates, bowls and glasses.

There is demand for urgent climate action from communities across the world, especially those whose lives and livelihoods have been impacted.
Climate action is happening.
To do this, we need bold leadership, political will and further ramping up of climate action.","""Bula"" is a Fijian greeting; it means ""hello"", but also means ""life"" and being alive. Today in the German city of Bonn, Fiji takes over the Presidency of COP. COP, or the Conference of the Parties, is the UN's annual climate change summit - following on from COP22 in Marrakech and COP21 in 2015 when the ground-breaking Paris Agreement was born. The Paris Agreement committed to collective leadership and shared responsibility to solve the climate change challenge. Now, almost two years after the Paris Climate Agreement was reached, its time to turn pledges to climate action and reduce our carbon emissions for a 1.5°C future.

In Paris, countries said they would do a whole host of important (but mainly) technical things by 2018 to ensure that global temperature rise was limited to well below 2°C with efforts towards 1.5°C. Over the next two weeks COP23 aims to progress these - including more clarity on the rules to implement the Paris Agreement and the design of the 2018 ""Talanoa dialogue"" on how the necessary tightening of countries' emissions reduction targets will work. ""Talanoa"" is derived from ""tala"" meaning ""talking or telling stories,"" and ""noa"" meaning ""zero or without concealment"" - so a frank and open dialogue.

2017 has seen unprecedented extreme weather events - from the deadly monsoonal flooding in South-Asia, to hurricanes such as Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria flattening cities in the Caribbean and US, and the ""Lucifer"" heatwave in Europe. The science is increasingly clear that the increased likelihood and severity of these extreme weather events can be attributed to climate change. There is demand for urgent climate action from communities across the world, especially those whose lives and livelihoods have been impacted. This urgency needs to be felt in the negotiations.

Two events in the climate world happened on Saturday, 4th of November. First, it was the one-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement becoming international law- the Agreement has been ratified by 169 countries and covers almost 88 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the climate march in Bonn saw an estimated 25,000 people call for the end to coal-fired power (coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and the main source of electricity in Germany) Rapidly removing coal from the energy mix and replacing with renewable energy is crucial to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Some countries are starting to commit to phase out coal power, including the UK and Italy by 2025 and Canada the Netherlands by 2030. Other countries, such as China and India, are delaying or cancelling planned coal-fired power stations as they seek to cut pollution and are instead turning to cheaper renewable energy sources like solar.

The UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2017 looks at the gap between the current country pledges and the total emissions reductions needed to limit temperature rise to 2ᵒC. It finds significant potential for this gap to be closed if contributions from businesses, cities, sub-national governments, civil society, investors, and many others are made. Efforts by these groups are collectively referred to as the Action Agenda, and COP23 will have a significant focus on them. WWF itself will be hosting important discussions and events with many groups at COP23 (see www.panda.org/cop23).

Climate action is happening. For example, record amounts of renewable energy generation are being built worldwide as their costs continue to fall, and most vehicle manufacturers have indicated that they will bring out fully electric models in the near future.

This is the good news.

The bad news is that much more needs to be done. We are not yet on a path that will see us limit to 2°C warming let alone the target of 1.5°C that is essential if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. To do this, we need bold leadership, political will and further ramping up of climate action.

Every nation also has a part to play. The UK Government needs to be doing more as a global leader on climate action - for example through more energy-efficient houses, more renewable energy and a faster rollout of electric vehicles. Last month the UK Government outlined its plan to reach its current targets to 2030 in the Clean Growth Strategy. Worryingly, the strategy won't actually get us all the way to the targets we've already agreed to 2030, let alone the more ambitious targets we'll need to set to meet the Paris agreement.

As COP23 kicks off today it is important that the frank and open ""talanoa"" spirit infuses the discussions to ensure our ambition for a 1.5°C future is reached.

Wenn man den Bewohnern Glauben schenken darf, soll das Dorf jedoch verflucht sein

Wie die Bewohner mit dem vermeintlichen Fluch umgehen, seht ihr oben im Video

Die kleine Ortschaft Colobraro in der süditalienischen Region Basilikata soll verflucht sein. Deshalb trauen sich die Einwohner der umliegenden Dörfer noch nicht einmal, den Namen des Ortes auszusprechen.

Das Wort Colobraro leitet sich von dem lateinischen Wort Coluber ab, was Schlange bedeutet. Für die abergläubischen Einheimischen ist die Schlange der Inbegriff des Bösen. Die Leute in der Region glauben, dass denjenigen, der den Namen laut ausspricht, Unheil verfolgen werde. Das geht auch aus einer Dokumentation des BBC hervor. Das Dorf wird deshalb nur “Quel pases“ genannt, was übersetzt nur “dieses Dorf“ heißt.

Der Fluch begann im Jahr 1940

Zudem soll ein alter Fluch über dem Dorf liegen, der im Jahr 1940 begann. Der damalige Bürgermeister prophezeite bei einer Versammlung, dass auf der Stelle ein Kronleuchter von der Decke stürzen werde - sollten die Zuhörern seinen Worten keinen Glauben schenken. Der Legende zufolge, die jeder Bewohner von Colobraro kennt, fiel der Leuchter darauf sofort herunter.

Darüber hinaus lebten bis in die 70er Jahre die damals berüchtigten “Masciare“ in dem Dorf. Dabei soll es sich um Zauberinnen gehandelt haben, die mit ihrer bösen Magie angeblich ganze Städte kontrollierten. Ein Anthropologe besuchte das Dorf im Jahr 1952, um die Geschichte der Masciare zu erforschen. Er wurde laut einer Legende selbst Opfer des Fluchs: Alle seine Kollegen wurden schlagartig krank.

Heute versuchen die Bewohner das Beste daraus zu machen

Seitdem sind die Bewohner der Region sicher, dass Colobraro verflucht ist. Der heutige Bürgermeister der Stadt versucht jedoch, das Beste aus der Lage zu machen. Er hat zum Beispiel ein Festival ins Leben gerufen, in dem die Bewohner Colobraros ihr verfluchtes Dorf feiern. Die Einwohner inszenieren darin jeden August ihre Unglückstraditionen. Frauen treten als Masciare auf, Wahrsagerinnen lesen Schicksale aus Händen der Besucher und die Bewohner verkaufen Schutzamulette. So kann die Gemeinde immerhin ihre klammen Kassen auffüllen.

FDP-Chef Christian Lindner schlägt im Poker um eine Jamaika-Koalition nun wieder harte Töne an. Seine Partei habe ""keine Angst vor Neuwahlen"", sagte er den Zeitungen der Funke-Mediengruppe am Sonntag. Er glaube auch nicht, dass dann vor allem die AfD profitiere.

In der Zwischenbilanz der Unterhändler hatte sich Lindner dann am Freitag eher zurückgehalten und von der Notwendigkeit gesprochen, Brücken zu bauen. Kubicki mahnte danach die Kompromissbereitschaft aller Seiten an und warnte vor einer Neuwahl. Nun setzt Lindner wieder andere Akzente.

Mehrheit der Deutschen will Kohleausstieg

Die FDP hatte sich mit den Grünen unter anderem in der Klimapolitik heftig gestritten. Grünen-Fraktionschefin Katrin Göring-Eckardt erinnerte in der ""Bild am Sonntag"" an die am Montag in Bonn beginnende Weltklimakonferenz und sagte: ""Ausgerechnet jetzt blockieren Union und FDP. Gelingt es uns, den Knoten zu durchschlagen, gewinnt nicht nur das Weltklima. Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass so auch die Sondierungen besser vorankommen.""

Wenig freuen dürfte die Freien Demokraten eine Emnid-Umfrage für die Zeitung, nach der 59 Prozent der Deutschen dafür sind, dass die nächste Bundesregierung den Kohleausstieg beschließt. 69 Prozent der 504 Befragten wollen demnach Umwelt- und Klimaschutz im Zweifel Vorrang vor wirtschaftlichen Interessen geben - im Gegensatz zur FDP.

""We didn't know if they were going to survive 24 hours,"" Felicia Hogan says of her daughters Krista and Tatiana in a new CBC documentary. ""And then 24 hours went by and they survived.""

The twins have done more than survive. They celebrated their 11th birthday in October. They've learned to swim. And despite dealing with Type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, Krista and Tatiana go to school in Vernon, B.C. for a few hours every day.

""For them to actually be here for 10 years is just a blessing,"" Hogan told HuffPost Canada in an interview. ""It just felt so good to see them get to this milestone.""

The documentary ""Inseparable: Ten Years Joined At The Head,"" follows the Hogan family for a year leading up to the girls' 10th birthday party. Along with the twins, Hogan and her husband Brendan are raising three other children: 15-year-old Rosa, 13-year-old Christopher, and 9-year-old Shaylee.

Krista and Tatiana are ordinary girls with extraordinary abilities. As craniopagus twins — conjoined twins attached at the head — they are one in 2.5 million. They share a ""thalamic bridge"" that connects their brains, allowing them to see through each other's eyes, taste what each other eats, and even know each other's thoughts without speaking.

""The abilities they have that no one else could imagine having are just incredible,"" Hogan said. They play together, and without saying a word, get up when one decides she wants to do something else.

They're just little people that are here living their lives like the rest of us. Felicia Hogan

Krista and Tatiana's doctor, pediatric neurologist Dr. Juliette Hukin, has tracked their development since they were two. ""They're the only twins that I'm aware of who are alive and remain conjoined with this shared connectivity,"" Hukin said in a press release.

Now that the girls are old enough to describe their experiences, doctors can better understand their connection, said the documentary's director and executive producer Judith Pyke.

""It was cool to hear from them about how they can see through each others' eyes or move each others' limbs,"" Pyke said in an email. ""But just as striking is they get along incredibly well.""

Tatiana and Krista Hogan pose for a photo with family.

Despite their unfathomable connection, they're very typical siblings, Hogan said. They have ""off moments"" when they argue and scream at each other.

""They're definitely different"" in personality, she pointed out.

Krista is the family's jokester. She loves playing pranks and making people laugh. She is also the bigger twin and tends to take charge, Hogan explained.

Tatiana, on the other hand, is a ""little lovebug."" She loves cuddling animals and wants to hug everyone who comes by the house.

The girls love running around outside and going camping — and like all kids these days, play video games and watch funny videos on their iPad.

Conjoined twin Tatiana and Krista Hogan are held by their mother Felicia in Vernon, B.C. on Dec. 18, 2006.

Felicia Hogan hugs her daughter Krista.

The massive document leak known as Paradise Papers reveals that 714 Indians are linked to tax havens including Bollywood veteran Amitabh Bachchan, corporate lobbyist Niira Radia, liquor baron and fugitive Vijay Mallya, Union Minister Jayant Sinha and Sanjay Dutt's wife Manyata.

India ranks 19 among 180 countries in the number of names in the list.

The Indian Express reported today that Bachchan, whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers leak in 2016, became a shareholder of a digital media company incorporated in Bermuda in 2002, one year after he hosted the first season of the TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati.

The newspaper noted that it was unclear if Bachchan had reported his shareholding in the Bermuda-based Jalva Media Ltd to the Reserve Bank of India (as required by Indian law at the time).

In 2005, a notice published in The Bermuda Sun described the company as a ""bad debtor"" which stands ""dissolved.""

Over 13 million files revealed on Sunday, the bulk from two centuries-old Bermuda-based law firm Appleby, contain details of the offshore holdings of top politicians, celebrities and corporations. The documents were obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in collaboration with 96 media organizations.

The data reveals that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has $13 million of her private money invested in off shore funds based in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.

The documents also reveal that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov.

Another notable finding in the Paradise Papers is about Stephen Bronfman, the top fund raiser and senior advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Brofman, according to the documents, was involved in moving millions of dollars to offshore tax havens.

Among the Indians, the Paradise Papers also names corporate lobbyist Niira Radia who was at the centre of the Radia Tapes media scandal in 2010.

The Indian Express reported today that Radia was part of two offshore companies based in Malta. She was director of the Suez La Vallette Limited in April 2012 and the Pegasus International Advisors Limited in August 2011.

Radia was ""removed"" from Suez La Vallette Limited in August 2014 and ""resigned"" in February 2014 from Pegasus International Advisors Limited, the newspaper reported.

Union Minister Jayant Sinha features in the Paradise Papers because he was the managing director of Omidyar Network, which invested in D. Light, a US company that has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands.

Sinha, who resigned from the company in 2013, was elected to parliament in 2014. In a series of tweets today, the minister responded to being listed in the Paradise Papers.

""These were bonafide and legal transactions undertaken on behalf of highly reputed world-leading organisations in my fiduciary role as Partner at Omidyar Network and its designated representative on the D.Light Board. All these transactions have been fully disclosed to relevant authorities through all necessary filings as required,"" the minister said, adding, ""It is crucial to note that these transactions were done for D.Light as an Omidyar representative, and not for any personal purpose.""

Manyata, Sanjay Dutt's wife, also appears in the Paradise Papers under her former name Dilnashin. The Indian Express reported that she is the director Nasjay Company Limited, set up in the Bahamas in April 2010.

Her spokesperson told the newspaper, ""As per the requirements of provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961, all the properties, company or body corporate or shares in any company are declared in the balance sheet.""

Nun teilt die junge Frau den Abschiedsbrief der Mutter, mit einer wichtigen Botschaft

Die ganze Geschichte seht ihr im Video oben

Die 18-jährige Hannah Summers aus dem amerikanischen Indiana hat mit einem Tweet Hunderttausende Twitter-Nutzer berührt. Ihre Botschaft ist simpel, aber berührend: Schätzt eure Eltern.

Die Vorgeschichte dazu ist traurig. Vor wenigen Tagen starb Hannahs Mutter Peggy im Alter von 55 Jahren an Nierenkrebs. Sie hinterließ Hannah und ihren Geschwistern emotionale Briefe, in denen sie sich von jedem ihrer Kinder verabschiedete.

Obwohl sie zuerst mit sich haderte, veröffentlichte die junge Frau den Abschiedsbrief der Mutter in den sozialen Medien, um der Welt zu zeigen, “was für eine Person meine Mutter war. Sie war stets besorgter um andere als um sich selbst und war so eine großartige Mutter für alle ihre Kinder.”

In dem Brief an Hannah schrieb die Mutter demnach: “Es tut mir so leid. Ich habe versucht, diese furchtbare Krankheit zu überwinden, aber ich denke, Gott hatte andere Pläne für mich.”

""Ich bin immer noch genauso stolz auf dich, wie ich es immer war""

Mutter Peggy erinnerte ihre Tochter daran, dass sie noch viele Menschen in ihrem Leben habe, die sie lieben und mit denen sie in dieser schweren Zeit reden solle. Sie riet ihr, sich mit Menschen zu umgeben, die an die selben Dinge glauben. “Aber vergiss nicht, dass ich immer noch bei dir bin”, schrieb sie weiter. “Und ich bin immer noch genauso stolz auf dich, wie ich es immer war.”

Außerdem richtete sie auch Worte an ihre zukünftigen Enkelkinder. “Falls du eines Tages Kinder haben solltest, stelle sicher, dass sie wissen, wie sehr ich auch sie liebe und wie gerne ich sie kennengelernt hätte.”

Zum Schluss gab sie ihrer Tochter noch mit auf den Weg, jeden Tag zu leben, als wäre es ihr letzter. Man wisse nie, wann dieser sei.

Der HuffPost erzählte die 18-Jährige, dass es für sie sehr schwer war, den Brief zu lesen. Trotzdem habe sie sich getröstet gefühlt.

Sie hat eine wichtige Nachricht

Mit ihrem Tweet, der den Brief der Mutter beinhaltet, erreichte die Schülerin Hunderttausende Menschen und erhielt über 1000 Antworten.

An all diese Menschen hat Hannah eine wichtige Nachricht: “Nehmt das als Anlass eure Eltern heute etwas fester zu drücken. Seht sie nicht als selbstverständlich an. Denn wir wissen alle nicht, wie lange wir sie bei uns haben werden.”

""The bodies are getting weak,"" Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani said.

The peaceful standoff between hungry refugees in the Manus Island detention centre, and Papua New Guinean authorities waiting outside the gates, has entered its third day as the men inside dig wells for water, sleep outside due to the stifling heat inside, and fears of sickness and injury grow.

The centre, officially closed on October 31, still has around 600 refugees and asylum seekers inside. The men from countries like Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria are refusing to move from the centre to new accommodation in the nearby town of Lorengau.

The men cite prior violence from locals, including machete attacks and robberies and fear they will be subject to further danger if they leave the safety of the Lombrum facility.

The United Nations High Commission for Refugees also reported at least one of the new facilities was unfinished, lacking water or power connections as of Monday, and said the other two facilities did not yet have security fences.

One man who accepted the offer to relocate to a new facility returned to Lombrum on Thursday, having walked three hours back on foot, saying he ""could not stay in that place"".

Inside the Lombrum centre, conditions are fast deteriorating. The last food packages were distributed over the weekend, while water and power connections have long since been cut off.

The men have rigged up tarpaulins and pipes to drain rainwater into garbage bins for storage while others have dug a deep well into the ground in attempts to find water. They were successful, but the water they draw from the well -- using a small plastic bucket and thin rope -- is dirty and cloudy.

""The water is not clean enough for people to drink but they are boiling it on a small fire so it can be used,"" Boochani told HuffPost Australia.

Many men in the centre slept out in the open air on Thursday night, unable to bear the stifling conditions inside the buildings which have been left without air conditioning after power was cut. While it is now too hot to stay inside, the men are also fearful of mosquitos and the infections they may carry.

Many of the men are afflicted with debilitating physical injuries and severe psychological conditions and their medicine has run out.

A refugee told HuffPost Australia the men are surviving on one small meal a day, plus collected rainwater. Crowdfunding campaigns have popped up in Australia to raise money to buy food and water for the men.

""The problem is our resources. We have not much money,"" the refugee said.

Refugees also claim the navy, which owns the Lombrum facility and have been positioned outside the gates of the centre as they wait to reclaim the centre, has blocked the entry of food into the centre.

Boochani said a local missionary had tried to bring packages into the facility on Thursday but was denied admission, while the missionary himself posted his claims on Facebook.

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

Before and After the Green Revolution Per-capita income in Southeast Asia: $351 $1,027 Cereal production in Southeast Asia: 33.8M metric tons 73.6M metric tons +193 +118 1970 Go to 1970 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| 1995 Go to 1995

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

El caso de Wilbur Ross

Ross podría estar involucrado en un conflicto de intereses al ser copropietario de Navigator Holdings que negocia con Rusia y Venezuela.

Entre los principales clientes de esta naviera está Sibur, una empresa de gas y petroquímica, de la cual Kirill Shamalov ( yerno del presidente Vladimir Putin ) es copropietario. Y dos de los propietarios de Sibur son el yerno de Putin, Kirill Shamalov, y el empresario ruso Gennady Timchenko, sancionado por Washington por actividades que, según el Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, estaban relacionadas directamente con el Presidente ruso.

Según el diario The New York Times, aliado del ICIJ, cuando Ross se convirtió en secretario de Comercio en febrero pasado, vendió la mayoría de sus multimillonarias inversiones pero retuvo una participación cercana a 31% de la multinacional británica de transporte marítimo Navigator Holdings.

Se sabía que Ross tenía algunos lazos empresariales con Rusia, dado que fue vicepresidente del Banco de Chipre que ha financiado históricamente a oligarcas rusos, y ese tema preocupó a algunos senadores durante su proceso de confirmación este año; pero hasta ahora no había pruebas de ningún vínculo con el entorno de Putin.

Tener una empresa offshore no es un delito por sí mismo , a menos que se utilice para evadir impuestos o lavar dinero.

Pero la participación de Ross en Navigator Holdings podría presentar conflictos de intereses, dado que el secretario de Comercio tiene el poder de influir en las sanciones y los acuerdos comerciales de Estados Unidos.

El fiscal especial Robert Mueller y dos comités del Congreso investigan desde hace meses la posibilidad de que existan lazos entre Rusia y la campaña electoral de Trump.

Otro de los clientes de Navigator es la estatal Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). En agosto pasado, el gobierno de Donald Trump prohibió a los estadounidenses y sus socios hacer negocios con dicha empresa, a la que el Departamento del Tesoro acusa de estar ""fuertemente asociada"" con ""la corrupción del gobierno venezolano"".

Lo niega

El secretario Ross no participó en la decisión de Navigator de hacer negocios con Sibur"", que ""en esa época no había sido sancionado, como tampoco lo ha sido ahora"", reaccionó el Departamento de Comercio en un comunicado.

Al ser designado para ocupar la Secretaría de Comercio, Wilbur había acordado con la Oficina Federal de Ética del gobierno entregar una lista de socios comerciales que pretendía conservar, pero no detalló las participaciones que él mismo había conservado, afirma The New York Times.

Then the fight ends somewhat suddenly, with Hulk coming down on Thor and the screen going to black. The next thing we know, the two wind up in the same suite/prison on Sakaar.

So wait, what? Hulk won the fight, right? Or did he and Thor both get knocked out? What happened during the blackout?

Der Fall eines herzlosen Autofahrers in Berlin sorgt für Empörung

Der 23-Jährige hatte Sanitäter attackiert, während sie ein einjähriges Baby reanimierten

Nun hat sich der Vater des Jungen zu dem Vorfall geäußert

Nach dem Aufsehen erregenden Rettungseinsatz für seinen einjährigen Sohn in Berlin hat sich nun der Vater des Kindes zu Wort gemeldet.

Das Kind war am Freitagmorgen in seiner Kita im Stadtteil Moabit beim Frühstück plötzlich ohnmächtig geworden, die herbeigerufenen Sanitäter stellten Kammerflimmern fest und mussten den Kleinen an Ort und Stelle wiederbeleben.

Ein 23-jähriger Mann, dessen Auto von den Rettungsfahrzeugen zugeparkt war, hatte die Sanitäter währenddessen attackiert und beschimpft. ""Mir doch egal, wer hier reanimiert wird""”, soll er gesagt haben. ""Verpisst euch, ich muss zur Arbeit.""

Der Vater des Einjährigen zeigte sich schockiert über das, was geschehen ist. ""Das Verhalten des Mannes ist unfassbar und unmenschlich"", sagte er der ""Bild""-Zeitung. ""Es ging um das Leben meines Sohnes, und er dachte nur an sich.""

Der 23-Jährige ging die Sanitäter nicht nur verbal an, sondern wurde auch handgreiflich. Er demolierte den Rettungswagen und trat einen Seitenspiegel ab. Erst, als die Polizei zu Hilfe kam und den Mann in Schach hielt, konnten die Sanitäter ihre Arbeit fortsetzen und den kleinen Jungen ins Krankenhaus bringen.

Nach Angaben der ""Bild"" liegt der Einjährige derzeit im künstlichen Koma und soll am Montag aufgeweckt werden.

Die Rede glich einer Kampfansage an Parteichef Horst Seehofer

Es müssen gute Tage für Bayerns Finanzminister Markus Söder sein. Seit Jahren wird er als Nachfolger des CSU-Vorsitzenden Horst Seehofer gehandelt.

Derzeit arbeitet sich der Chef in Berlin an den Grünen ab, zuhause begehrt die Jugend auf - und Söder sieht täglich seine Chancen wachsen, Seehofer zu beerben.

Eilig hat es Söder nicht. Das wurde auf der JU-Landesversammlung in Erlangen am Sonntag deutlich. ""Mein Wunsch und meine Hoffnung ist, dass wir gemeinsam eine Lösung finden, dass wir es zusammen tun"", sagte er über die künftige personelle Aufstellung der Partei. Wie Seehofer will er erst die Jamaika-Verhandlungen abwarten.

Eilig muss es Söder aber auch nicht haben. Denn die Personaldebatte in der CSU wird kommen - und mit seiner Rede brachte sich Söder gegen Seehofer in Stellung.

Klare Kampfansage

Söder mahnte, die Herausforderung müsse ""mit Anstand"" bewältigt werden - aber auch ""mit Ergebnissen"". Ein ""Weiter so"" dürfe es nicht geben - eine klare Kampfansage gegen Seehofer, kommentierte auch die ""Bild""-Zeitung diesen Satz.

Söder machte in seiner Rede deutlich, wie sehr sich die CSU nun ändern müsse. ""Es muss uns gelingen, unsere Basis zu motivieren und die Wähler ein Stück weit wieder zu inspirieren"", betonte er und forderte: ""Es muss am Ende ein Ruck durch die CSU und durch ganz Bayern gehen.""

""Söder - unsere Nummer 1""

Seehofer steht massiv unter Druck. Am Samstag forderte die bayerische Junge Union (JU) offen seinen Rücktritt.

In einer neuen Umfrage verliert die CSU weiter an Zuspruch: In einer Erhebung des Instituts Insa im Auftrag der ""Bild""-Zeitung vom Montag kommt die CSU nur noch auf 37 Prozent, bei der Bundestagswahl waren es noch etwas mehr als 38 Prozent.

Söder hatte den Mut der bayerischen JU mit ihrer Rücktrittsforderung gelobt. Er setzt zwar auf eine gemeinsame Lösung - die Sympathien der JU gehörten ihm an diesem Tag in Erlangen allerdings schon, wie Fotos zeigten. ""Söder - unsere neue Nummer 1"" stand auf Plakaten.

Bis Dezember muss Söder sich noch gedulden. Dann könnte es tatsächlich soweit sein.

Siempre he sabido que quería tener hijos. En mi caso, no era cuestión de si iba a tenerlos, sino cuándo. La gente me hace muchas preguntas. Voy a intentar responder algunas aquí.

Hace poco vino al mundo mi hija pequeña, Mayte Amor, el 4 de octubre, y ya está junto a sus hermanos mayores, Mario, de 4, y Mia Alma, de 2.

Los tres descienden genéticamente de mí y han nacido gracias a la generosidad de diferentes madres anónimas por gestación subrogada, usando los óvulos que ellas mismas donaron.

Contacté a una agencia para que me guiara a través de todo este proceso, que puede llegar a ser muy complicado (y caro). No existe una ley estándar que regule la gestación subrogada en todo el país (Estados Unidos). De hecho, muchos estados la prohíben.

Para tener a mi primer hijo, Mario, el juzgado mandó a mi casa a un supervisor para entrevistarme e indagar cosas sobre mí. Después tuve que asistir al juzgado en persona y solicitar la custodia de mi propio hijo cuando naciera.

El proceso fue más simple con el segundo bebé, Mia Alma.

Muchos me preguntan por qué no adopto. ¿Le preguntarían lo mismo a una pareja heterosexual?

Espero que conforme pasen los años la gente comprenda mejor la gestación subrogada y que, con suerte, se legalice en todo el país. Pero ya no solo por los Estados Unidos, sino por todos nuestros aliados, que también están pasando por dificultades.

Muchos me preguntan por qué no adopto. ¿Le preguntarían lo mismo a una pareja heterosexual? ¿Por qué no iba a querer tener mis propios hijos biológicos? Aunque no descarto la adopción en el futuro, para mí era importante tener hijos con mi ADN.

Mi padre falleció cuando yo tenía 15 años y tener descendencia era la única forma de hacer que una parte de él perviviera, literalmente.

Mi familia es increíble y poco convencional, desde luego. Les suelo explicar a mis hijos que tienen una familia diferente del resto. Mi madre vive con nosotros y pocas familias tienen esa suerte. Esa diferencia nos hace especiales y estupendos. Cuando mis hijos crezcan, seguiré sincerándome con ellos con mayor profundidad.

Les suelo explicar a mis hijos que tienen una familia diferente del resto.

Una de las principales razones por las que escogí a mi donante de óvulos es porque parecía ser buena persona. Estoy seguro de que el dinero era uno de sus motivos, pero se notaba que era una persona buena y decente, algo que todos los trabajadores de la agencia de reproducción asistida mencionaron. Y eso era importante para mí. Mucho más de lo que parece, y mentiría si dijera lo contrario.

De hecho, elegí a la donante de óvulos de entre la lista de candidatas comunes que me ofrecía la agencia (hay una ""lista VIP"" llena de antiguas reinas de concursos de belleza).

Me encanta ser padre. Más que cualquier otra cosa en el mundo. Y me esfuerzo al máximo. Ya fuera consciente o inconscientemente, quería tener mis propios hijos. Me tomo este asunto muy en serio.

Tener que hacer frente a una crianza inestable en la que los niños no dejan de cambiar de hogar es un asunto que, de poder ser, mucho padres querrían evitar.

También quería tener hijos antes de hacerme demasiado mayor. Con suerte, la próxima etapa de mi vida la podré centrar en el amor y en los hombres. Por ahora, estoy demasiado ocupado cambiando pañales y llevando a los niños a natación. ¡Y no cambiaría ni un detalle!

The 100-foot-long void, which is roughly the length of an NBA court, was found by an international team of scientists who announced the results of their findings in the journal Nature on Thursday.

“We don’t know if it’s a chamber, a tunnel, a big gallery or things like that,” Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of the Scan Pyramids project, which published the finding, told the New York Times. “We have chosen the word ‘void’ and nothing else because we don’t know what this void is.”

Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters Researchers examining the Great Pyramid of Giza say they have found a 100-foot-long cavity inside.

The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as Khufu’s Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh, is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids.

According to the article in Nature, the chamber is located above the pyramid’s Grand Gallery, which is a sloping passageway between the King’s Chamber and the smaller Queen’s Chamber. Though it’s not yet known what this chamber was used for, researchers suspect it is likely empty.

“There’s zero chance of hidden burial chambers,” Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the United Kingdom’s University of Bristol, said in the Nature report.

Dodson reasons that they have already found the pyramid’s burial chamber, which holds a sarcophagus. He suspects that this large room is a “relieving chamber,” which is designed to reduce weight above the Grand Gallery.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images The Grand Gallery, identified with the number 10, is seen sloping between the King’s Chamber (number 12) and the smaller Queen’s Chamber (number 8). The void was detected directly above the Grand Gallery.

According to Tayoubi, people have wondered for hundreds of years if there could be hidden chambers inside of the pyramid.

It was his own curiosity about the subject that prompted Scan Pyramids to position equipment inside the pyramid that is able to detect subatomic particles called muons, which are able to pass through the pyramid.

The muon detectors were placed inside the Queen’s Chamber and directed to record the muons’ locations and activity throughout the structure. Because the particles are partially absorbed by the stone, areas inside of the pyramid found with larger than normal collections of muons suggested a large space, the report states.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images A view inside of the pyramid's Grand Gallery is seen in a photo taken in 2005.

After several months of monitoring the detectors, “we had an unexpected line,” Tayoubi said in the report.

To back up the equipment’s findings, two other teams of physicists from France and Japan placed different types of muon detectors both inside and outside the pyramid. Those detectors reported the same void above the Grand Gallery.

“It was a big surprise,” says Tayoubi. “We’re really excited.”

When did it become okay for men to tickle their female colleagues or give them a full-body hug from behind or sandwich them between each other in the workplace? I don't think even wrestlers do so, right?

But hey, it seems a little slap and tickle is more than kosher on the sets of 'The Great Indian Light Molestation', sorry, I meant 'Laughter Challenge'.

Far more disturbing than the alleged sexist slur on The Great Indian Laughter Challenge and the ensuing controversy between Mallika Dua and Akshay Kumar, are the opening credits of the show – as I found out over the last two weekends. For all of you who've missed the show, let me bring you up to speed. The Great Indian Laughter Challenge is a show on Star India which has a celebrity judge in the form of Akshay Kumar, who has done his share of comedy. And had three mentor judges — Zakir Khan, Hussain Dalal and Mallika Dua — who would choose 12 stand-up comics as finalists for the show. The show's anchor is Katrina Kaif-doppelganger and Bigg Boss contestant Eli Avram.

All good till now. It's not a manel, there's female representation, and the judges and mentors are all directly connected to comedy. (The three mentor judges have been removed as of last week, to be replaced by that doyen of comedy, Sajid Khan and the saving grace that is Shreyas Talpade.) The format of the show is that if you want to choose a contestant, you have to ring a bell or ""bell bajao"" – a take on the Hindi aesthetic phrase, ""bell bajaana"". Or to take the mickey out of someone.

The week of the three mentors being summarily removed from the show, there was a brouhaha because journalist Vinod Dua wrote a Facebook post about the sexist remarks made by the ""cretin"" Akshay Kumar about his daughter Mallika when she was ringing the bell for a contestant. Kumar said, ""Tum uska bell bejao, mein tumhara bell bajaata hu"" (literally translating to - you ring his bell and I'll ring yours). Mallika posted about it, got trolled by Akshay fans, and deleted the post soon after.

This was followed by a video being released of a comic who imitated Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to wide applause (and was the same person Dua was ringing the bell for). This comic's act was deleted from the show and he was asked to perform a new act. Everyone cried censorship, blue murder, we love comedy - the usual noises were made and forgotten.

Which is what made me tune into this show to see what the kerfuffle was all about.

And I must admit none of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

The opening credits of the episodes with Dua, Dalal and Khan had Akshay Kumar repeatedly tickle Mallika Dua. Because that's what grown men are supposed to do to grown women on a show about comedy. Tickle them. Not tickle the male mentors, though. That would be too 'gay', right? If there was something to be offended by, one would think it would be this. But these are concessions one must make for getting a toehold in mainstream entertainment, I suppose.

None of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

Now this treatment wasn't reserved for Mallika Dua. In the episode in which Sajid Khan and Shreyas Talpade came on as judges, there was no one to tickle in the credits. But the producers, director and I'm assuming Kumar thought outside the box and came up with a routine which left me goggle-eyed. Eli Avram, the anchor, came on the stage only to have Sajid Khan hold a red heart-shaped balloon against her chest, while Talpade held it against her back. They then sandwiched her between them, with Khan facing her and jumping to and fro while holding the said balloon to her bosom. Through it all, Akshay Kumar laughed uproariously. Avram also giggled. And finally, Kumar hugged Avram from the back.

This is a workplace which seems tailor-made for Harvey Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman, Shakti Kapoor, and Brett Ratner.

We all know that jokes about Mr Modi may not pass muster on most channels. But that really is the least of our concerns right now. Going by 'The List' being released, and the unending stories of powerful men who have gotten away with sexually harassing women at the workplace, there are far greater worries than not being able to crack a joke about Modi. The rampant sexism and manhandling of women, which seems to pass off as normal in Hindi films and TV shows, is actually what we should be concerned about while discussing The Great Laughter Challenge. What's worse is that the women seem to be loving the inappropriate touching and attention, much like in horrendous films like Grand Masti and Judwaa 2 and so on. This is the sexual and sexist tripe that male audiences watch and then emulate. The one thing you can be sure of, there was nothing to laugh at by the end of it. A pity, since the comedy acts were quite good. But when you have a lewd and sexist sideshow headlined by a superstar, it's hard to pay attention to the main act.

If you'd like a lesson in how not to behave with female colleagues, do watch The Great Indian Laughter Challenge on Saturday and Sunday at 8pm on Star India.

Todas las mujeres en el México corporativo alguna vez nos hemos preguntado en cómo conseguir un aumento de sueldo. Aquí comparto algunos tips que te pueden ser útiles para lograrlo:

Aprende a negociar

Negociar es una de las acciones más importantes que debemos de aprender. No obstante, a pesar de todos sus beneficios, a las mujeres todavía nos cuesta mucho trabajo hacerlo en comparación con los hombres. La vida es una serie de negociaciones; negociamos todos los días y es por eso que resulta fundamental aprender las herramientas para comunicarnos de manera clara y oportuna. De esta forma, podremos aspirar a lograr mejores resultados no solo para nuestra vida personal, sino también para nuestra carrera profesional.

Es importante que te des cuenta que las diferencias de sueldo por temas de género son reales en todo el mundo y comienzan desde muy temprano en tu carrera. En la misma línea, de acuerdo con estudios realizados por la organización Lean In, de Sheryl Sandberg (COO de Facebook), existen estereotipos de género que afectan nuestra manera de negociar y es relevante que los conozcas para que no caigas en sus trampas. De acuerdo con esta investigación, por lo general se espera que los hombres sean asertivos y vean por ellos mismos en la negociación, mientras que si una mujer adopta esa misma postura puede llegar a ser seriamente perjudicada, ya que la misma actitud se percibe de manera desfavorable tanto por hombres como por mujeres.

Los estudios demuestran que, debido a los estereotipos, se espera que las mujeres negocien de manera colaborativa. Una estrategia para combatir este estereotipo es usar un lenguaje comunal, es decir, enfatizando nuestro interés en las relaciones organizacionales. Por poner algunos ejemplos, puedes decir: ""Si me uno al equipo, haré lo mejor para contribuir a su éxito. Es importante que mi sueldo refleje el nivel educativo y de habilidades que me facilitará lograr los objetivos de la empresa"". Otra forma de demostrar tu conexión con otros es hablando de la desigualdad de género: ""Dado que las mujeres generalmente ganamos menos por el mismo trabajo, ambos estaríamos decepcionados si yo no negociara mi sueldo"".

Calladita no te ves más bonita

Como mujeres tendemos a quedarnos calladas y no levantamos la voz cuando queremos o necesitamos un cambio. Es muy importante que si estamos dando resultados en la empresa y estamos listas para una nueva posición, se lo hagamos saber a nuestr@ jef@. Es increíble la cantidad de mujeres que están listas para dar el siguiente paso en su carrera y les da miedo levantar la mano. De acuerdo a estudios realizados por Lean In, los hombres se lanzan a una nueva posición cuando se sienten preparados en un 60% mientras que las mujeres se esperan a entender el 100% para sentirse listas para asumir una nueva posición.

Es muy importante que si estamos dando resultados en la empresa y estamos listas para una nueva posición, se lo hagamos saber a nuestr@ jef@

Es importante abrirse a tomar más riesgos y a vencer el miedo. Es difícil cambiar los sentimientos pero sí puedes cambiar la forma en la que piensas y actúas. Cuando entras a una reunión de trabajo sintiéndote insegura, recuérdate a ti misma que te has ganado tu posición. Entonces toma un asiento en la mesa, levanta la mano y sorpréndete a ti misma de que lo puedes lograr. De la misma forma, cuando te enfrentes a un reto, recuérdate a ti misma que el hombre que tienes sentado al lado piensa que lo puede lograr y si él puede tú también. Cuando vences tus inseguridades vas ganando más confianza en ti misma, lo que te abre las puertas a nuevas oportunidades.

No abandones tus hobbies

Llega un punto en el que empezamos a ver los hobbies como si solo fueran pasatiempos y una absoluta pérdida de tiempo, pero no es así (¡y menos en el mundo millennial en el que vivimos ahora!) Es verdad que en tus primeros puestos estos no juegan un rol tan importante, pero conforme más vas subiendo la escalera corporativa, tus hobbies se vuelven cada día más relevantes y son un diferenciador clave entre tú y las otras personas que van a competir por el siguiente puesto.

Cuando se asumen mayores responsabilidades dentro de la empresa, por lo general, se requiere menor tiempo de escritorio y más tiempo con los clientes o relacionado a la interacción con personas. Esto significa que entre más habilidades y conocimientos tengas fuera de aquellos estrictamente relacionados con tu trabajo, más oportunidades se te van a presentar para conectar y crear mejor rapport con personas. Así que si disfrutas de jugar golf, tennis o ajedrez, tocar el piano, esquiar, aprender idiomas, tomar clases de cocina... no lo dejes porque todo eso ¡te va a servir en el momento que menos te imaginas!

Entre más habilidades y conocimientos tengas fuera de aquellos estrictamente relacionados con tu trabajo, más oportunidades se te van a presentar para conectar y crear mejor 'rapport' con personas.

Recuerdo cuando estaba estudiando la maestría que se abrieron muy pocas oportunidades para hacer internships y poder trabajar durante mi posgrado. Yo estaba en desventaja en comparación con muchos de mis compañeros porque no tengo nacionalidad estadounidense (esto representa un costo adicional para las empresas). Además, había miles de solicitudes de empleo no solo de mi programa sino de otras decenas de universidades y programas que competían por la misma oportunidad.

La razón por la cual yo me llevé el internship que yo quería fue en gran parte porque tuve una gran conexión con la persona que me entrevistó. Esto fue gracias a que compartíamos múltiples intereses extracurriculares. Todos los estudiantes que fueron entrevistados contaban con los requisitos técnicos para ocupar el puesto, lo que significa que el diferenciador no se encuentra en estos, sino en la conexión que va más allá de los temas técnicos.

Vuélvete irremplazable

Uno de los mejores libros que he leído se llama The Linchpin, del escritor Seth Godin (se los recomiendo muchísimo). En esencia, la tesis del libro sostiene que las empresas poco a poco te van convirtiendo en un engranaje dentro de su sistema y progresivamente, al sistematizar poco a poco todas sus operaciones, te vas volviendo rápidamente sustituible. Esto acaba sucediendo en la mayoría de los casos, a menos que hagas un esfuerzo sostenido para volverte irremplazable, es decir, ""un artista en la empresa"".

Para lograr volverse irremplazable dentro de una empresa es importante aprender a pensar fuera del manual y buscar iniciativas que agreguen valor a la misma más allá de los procesos (esto no significa que te brinques los procesos, sino que los trasciendas y ofrezcas algo más). Aquí se debe de cambiar la mentalidad de ""¿qué saco de la empresa?"" a ""¿qué puedo ofrecer a la empresa?""

Cuando tengas una reunión de trabajo trata de dar más de lo que esperan de ti. No asumas que las buenas respuestas son suficientes, tienes que adelantarte y preparar preguntas inquisitivas.

But we are no longer a sophisticated nation. We have officially given up.

We have decided it's okay for the lunatics to run the asylum, for guns to be the dominating force in our lives, for God to be our leader in absentia. Somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, gun-loving Americans believe He will protect them.

I heard someone in Sutherland tell a reporter that this kind of thing doesn't happen here – it happens in places like New York. No, in New York we have our share of crime, and yes, we have had our share of terrorism. But this is not ground zero for crazy white man shooting rampages. That typically happens in other places, not here.

It happens in small towns such as Sutherland, Texas, where the population doesn't even come close to 1,000, where seven percent of the population was killed in this week's shooting.

Anxiety about an upcoming trip, eating unhealthy restaurant food at your destination or sleeping less can trigger bodily stress that leads to menstrual changes, Brandi said.
“Daily hormone schedules are altered, leading to changes in hormones and thus changes in periods.”It’s more likely your period will come late or skip than come early, Brandi said.

“If you are traveling and skip one period, it’s probably no big deal,” she said.","Many female travelers know that taking a trip can majorly mess with your period. Travel ― especially long-haul or international journeys ― can cause periods to come late, early or skip a cycle altogether.

The simple reason is that your body is stressed, even if it’s on the beach drinking a piña colada.

Of course, an island vacation may not sound “stressful” in the casual sense of the word. But to your body, “stress” is anything that throws its systems out of their usual routine, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician and gynecologist with Boston Medical Center who teaches at Boston University School of Medicine.

Anxiety about an upcoming trip, eating unhealthy restaurant food at your destination or sleeping less can trigger bodily stress that leads to menstrual changes, Brandi said. One of the biggest culprits is likely a change of time zones. Exposure to light at different times of day can throw off your circadian rhythm, the internal body clock that’s closely linked to hormone production.

“When you alter the circadian rhythm, your body perceives that as a stressor,” Brandi said. “Daily hormone schedules are altered, leading to changes in hormones and thus changes in periods.”

It’s more likely your period will come late or skip than come early, Brandi said. If you do get a period while traveling, the lightness or heaviness of your flow should be normal.

“If you are traveling and skip one period, it’s probably no big deal,” she said. “Missing two or more periods after travel is likely related to something else going on, and you should seek care.”

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.","After four years of undergraduate education and another three at law school, Sarah Spitz landed a job she loves — and a debt load she resents.

A new hire at a boutique law firm in Toronto, Spitz has $60,000 owing on an $80,000 line of credit, and another $11,000 in provincial student loans.

""I'm very happy with where I ended up, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that debt didn't have a huge impact on what firms I applied to, what career choices I made, where I was willing to work, the kind of work I was willing to do.""

Sarah Spitz is among the ranks of people who have grown to resent their ""good"" debt.

The notions of ""good debt"" and ""bad debt"" are a kind of investors' shorthand for understanding whether the kind of borrowing they're doing is likely to pay off in the longer term.

Student debt is generally considered ""good"" debt: it allows borrowers to increase their income in the long run. But as countless former students struggling with debt can tell you, paying down even a ""good"" debt can be a source of stress and financial difficulty.

""Sure, I'm increasing my earning potential by a lot, but it also really affected my 20s,"" Spitz told HuffPost Canada. ""And it's really anxiety-inducing to look at your bank statement and the column that's negative $80,000 — you're like, oh my God, that's soul-crushing.""

THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF GOOD AND BAD DEBT Traditionally, ""good debt"" is the sort that helps you gain wealth or income, while bad debt is money spent on goods that are consumed over time. Here's a breakdown of what is generally considered ""good"" debt and ""bad"" debt: GOOD DEBT Mortgages help you build equity in real estate, making you wealthier over time

In Canada, as in most of the developed world, the largest source of ""good"" debt is the mortgage.

Canadians are almost unequivocal in their support of mortgages. In a 2013 poll from the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals, 80 per cent of Canadians agreed that mortgages are ""good debt.""

But a recent survey from Angus Reid found half of Canada's home-owning young adults are experiencing buyer's remorse, with the high cost of servicing that debt as the single largest reason.

In other words, ""good debt"" can go bad, especially if you have more of it than you can handle — financially, or psychologically.

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.

Asking whether debt is bad or good ""is like asking 'Is bread good or bad,'"" he says. ""That's a silly question. What matters is, what's good for you?""

You may think that borrowing on a credit card to pay for a vacation is bad debt, ""but maybe a vacation is very important for your mental health,"" he says.

The Bank of Canada recently raised interest rates for the first time in seven years. Here's how that could affect your debt:

Hoyes warns that there is risk in taking to heart the notion that some types of debt are ""good"" — it can lead to irresponsible borrowing.

""If you believe a mortgage is good debt, you might spend as much as you can on a house,"" he said in an interview with HuffPost Canada.

Could that be part of the reason why Canadians have been willing to take on so much mortgage debt? With around $1.67 in debt for every dollar of disposable income, households here are the most indebted of any G7 country. And the Bank of Canada has been raising the alarm about the growing ranks of ""highly indebted"" consumers — those whose debt exceeds their annual income by more than 450 per cent.

""Households carrying high levels of debt could find it more difficult to adjust to a loss in income or other financial shock,"" the bank warned in December. ""They may be forced to sharply cut back on their spending and, in severe cases, may default on loans. The consequences for the economy and the financial system could be significant.""

So there you have it: you could even harm the economy taking on too much ""good debt.""

Determining the ""right"" amount of debt

But how do you know when if your ""good"" debt is actually bad?

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt,"" says Avraham Byers, a personal finance trainer and blogger.

His definition of good debt is different from the traditional model. For him, it's ""a balance you can comfortably pay every month, at a reasonable rate.""

He says there are many ""grey areas"" when it comes to debt. For instance, a car loan may be considered bad debt because vehicles depreciate in value (often losing a quarter to a third the moment you drive it off the lot), but what if a car is your only option for getting to work, and you don't have enough to buy in cash? Then, suddenly, an auto loan can look like good debt.

Personal finance coach Avraham Byers says you can tell you have too much debt if payments start eating into your lifestyle.

Or borrowing money for home renovations. Many argue it's good debt because it increases the value of your home.

""I don't know if that's true, especially if you plan to continue living there in the future,"" says Byers.

He suggests a rule of thumb for debt: Your monthly payments should be no more than 25 per cent of your monthly income before taxes.

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt."" Avraham Byers, personal finance trainer

Banks are often willing to lend you up to 36 per cent of your income, but he suggests not leaving it to them to decide.

""Banks might think you can handle it but it might not be true,"" Byers says. ""You've got to be realistic with what you can afford.""

For her part, Spitz says her experience with student debt will make her more cautious taking on debt in the future.

""I'm definitely more apprehensive than I would have been,"" she said. ""It's one thing to think about being in debt in the abstract, and a very different thing to experience it.""

And for the estimated 21 million Americans living with substance use disorders, support from friends could be the first step toward getting treatment.
Whatever you do, don’t enable your friend’s addiction — and that doesn’t mean just refraining from alcohol or drug use around them (though you should do that, too).
Both Olds and Raichbach say it’s important to take care of yourself while you’re supporting your friend.
Once your friend has made the huge decision to enter treatment, continuing to support them is critical to their recovery.","Life was never easy for Dorri Olds. She had her first suicidal thought at age 5 — her mother had yelled at her seemingly out of nowhere, and it shook her in a profound way. By age 11 she had smoked marijuana for the first time, quickly picking up a habit. Soon, she was drinking alcohol and using drugs regularly with a group of kids from her neighborhood.

“I loved the ritual of doing something you’re not supposed to do. That was exciting to me,” Olds told HuffPost. “I liked the wild kids. It was almost like seeing something shiny and sparkly and going after it.”

Things took a dark turn at age 13 for Olds, who is now 55, sober and a full-time freelance writer based in New York. She was raped by five of the boys she’d been hanging out with and she developed a severe addiction to drugs and alcohol.

She was medicating her trauma, she explained, and trying to pretend the assault had never happened by preventing herself from thinking about it. (She’s now working on a book project about sexual assault victims who were afraid to tell their stories and the effects of rape trauma.)

By age 26, Olds found that she couldn’t keep a job, and her relationships were getting shorter and shorter. That’s when her best friend and roommate stepped in to tell her enough was enough.

“I think I must have been up all night doing coke, and he must have known,” she said. “He shook me like a rag doll, and this vein on his forehead popped out and he started to cry and yell at me and he said, ‘I am not going to watch you kill yourself — that’s it. If you don’t stop right now, I’m leaving. Do you hear me? I’m leaving.’”

Soon after, she got herself into a treatment center and started attending regular Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and has been sober ever since.

“It’s a really hard thing to do, tough love, but I really think it’s the only thing that seems to work,” Olds said.

Tough love is one way to support a friend struggling with addiction, but there are others, too. And for the estimated 21 million Americans living with substance use disorders, support from friends could be the first step toward getting treatment.

Research has consistently found that support from friends is associated with positive outcomes ― including abstaining from drug and alcohol use, and remaining sober ― and tough love can in fact motivate people with substance use issues to seek treatment.

If someone you love is fighting an addiction, here are a few things you can do to offer them support:

Talk to your friend.

Sal Raichbach, a psychologist and chief of ethics and compliance at the Ambrosia Treatment Center, says that having an open, honest dialogue about addiction — when your friend is sober — can be an important move. Your friend might not respond well at first, but having a nonjudgmental conversation about your feelings and fears can open up a line of communication and, on some level, let your friend know they can talk to you.

“If the person struggling is in denial, is unwilling to admit the severity of their problem, or doesn’t want to talk, it still leaves room for that communication to take place in the future,” Raichbach said.

Start by letting your friend know you’ve noticed certain troubling behaviors, and tell them you’d like to address those behaviors. But always remember to keep judgment out of your voice.

“The best way to tell someone to get help without blaming or shaming them is to understand the disease of addiction before approaching them,” Raichbach said. “Their actions might be selfish, but behind those actions are a sick person.”

Never enable your friend.

Whatever you do, don’t enable your friend’s addiction — and that doesn’t mean just refraining from alcohol or drug use around them (though you should do that, too). Based on her experience, Olds says that loaning money to someone with addiction or bailing them out of addiction-related jams can enable their drug or alcohol use.

Raichbach agrees, and adds that offering to lend an ear when your friend needs support, or helping to look for a treatment center if they don’t know where to start, are good alternatives to enabling their addictions.

“Just don’t work harder than they do at getting them sober,” he said.

Consider an intervention.

If you’re unfamiliar with the premise of an intervention, here’s the gist: You get a loved one with a substance use problem into a room with others who love them, and you each explain the effect their addiction is having on your lives. You should have a therapist or intervention strategist present, and you might have resources ready to offer your friend, such as referrals to treatment centers or locations of AA meetings.

“Interventions can be a fantastic resource for getting friends and family the help they need,” Raichbach said. “They allow friends and family of the struggling individual, and often the individual themselves, to express their feelings and concerns in a constructive way — and make a plan [for recovery].”

You can learn more about how to stage an intervention here.

Consider tough love.

Olds says that while she knows relationships suffer when someone has an addiction, those people who do keep up friendships may at some point find that using a “tough love” strategy is the last option they have to help their friend get treatment.

“I know people in AA who have had to lock their kids out of their homes. They say, ‘You’re on your own,’” she explained. “They’ve tried everything — they’ve tried rehab, they’ve tried meetings, they’ve tried talking to them — and [the child] won’t stop. I really think the only answer is to cut them off.”

Raichbach says that giving “tough love” can be emotionally challenging as a friend, but “it can provide an essential push or incentive for them to seek help.”

Take care of yourself.

Being friends with someone living with an addiction is emotionally intense. Both Olds and Raichbach say it’s important to take care of yourself while you’re supporting your friend. Raichbach recommends setting boundaries and sticking to them, and Olds encourages friends of people with substance use disorders to attend support meetings as a way to understand the disease and hear from others facing similar struggles.

“The best thing you can do to help that person... is go to therapy and go to Al-Anon,” she said. “And if you go to therapy, go to somebody who understands addiction.”

Remain supportive while your friend is in recovery.

Once your friend has made the huge decision to enter treatment, continuing to support them is critical to their recovery. Olds says that reaching out, sleeping over if necessary, being there when your friend needs to talk or just bringing food are practical ways to help someone who’s recovering from an addiction. And refraining from drug and alcohol use in front of your friend is not only respectful ― it’s essential to your friend’s well-being.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) — Pakistan plans to build at least three to four big reactors as it targets nuclear power capacity of 8,800 megawatts (MW) by 2030, the country's atomic energy commission chairman said.

Pakistan has five small reactors in operation with combined capacity of just over 1,300 MW. The last one in the four-reactor Chashma plant in Punjab province, built by China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), went into operation in September this year.

It is also building two Chinese Hualong One reactors with a capacity of 1,100 MW each near the port city of Karachi.

Muhammad Naeem, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, told Reuters these two new reactors are now 60% and 40% complete respectively and should become operational in 2020 and 2021.

Pakistan is now also in the final stages of awarding contracts for an eighth nuclear reactor with 1100 MW capacity which would take the country's total nuclear capacity to about 5,000 MW when it is finished.

""We could award the contracts before year-end,"" Naeem told Reuters on the sidelines of a nuclear conference in Abu Dhabi.

He declined to say how many contenders are in the race and whether non-Chinese bidders may be in the running.

Pakistan's five operating reactors — including a tiny 125 MW Canadian-built reactor in Karachi in operation since 1972 — generate just 5% of the country's electricity, with the rest coming from oil, gas and some hydropower.

With about one quarter of Pakistan's population having no access to electricity, the government said late last year that it wants to boost nuclear capacity to 8,800 MW, or about 20% of power generation capacity, by 2030.

Naeem said Pakistan is looking at building at least three to four more big nuclear reactors before 2030 in order to reach that target.

""We have the plans in place, we are watching for proven technologies,"" he said, adding that funding would come from the state budget and loans.

He did not specify whether countries other than China may be invited to bid.

Pakistan, which has a nuclear weapons programme, has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which means Western reactor vendors such as EDF cannot sell reactors there. China has defied nuclear trading bans on Pakistan and delivered equipment as well as fuel.

Russia's Rosatom has built nuclear reactors in India, but a Rosatom official said earlier this year the firm has not worked with Pakistan.

Mia suocera ci ha affettuosamente definiti ""i maniaci del viaggio"". E lo capisco. Sono sicura che la loro generazione, in generale, sia cresciuta con valori diversi. Casa, macchina, mobili, gioielli e risparmi erano tutti di primaria importanza e un modo per mostrare il proprio status, il successo e i traguardi raggiunti. Non fraintendetemi, tutte queste cose sono ancora importanti (e vorrei che più persone potessero permettersi i piaceri materiali di questa vita senza sacrifici e pianificazione del budget). Tuttavia, la mia generazione inizia gradualmente ad avvicinarsi a un altro tipo di mentalità – dove le esperienze contano più delle cose. Le priorità stanno passando dall'accumulare oggetti all'accumulare esperienze.

Io e mio marito siamo solo una coppia qualunque con un reddito medio, che cerca di vivere al massimo e creare dei ricordi che dureranno per sempre. Data la scelta e i limiti di budget, preferirei guidare una semplice utilitaria ma andare in vacanza quattro volte all'anno, anziché dire no ad un viaggio e passare i prossimi dieci anni a pagarmi una Mercedes, solo per fare sfoggio del mio status. Inoltre, abbiamo stabilito fin da subito che preferiremmo spendere un occhio della testa in un ristorante tre stelle Michelin, anziché sprecare soldi per scambiarci dei regali.

Penserete che la mia sia un'ossessione, e forse avete anche ragione. Io preferisco definirla passione. In entrambi i casi, i sintomi sono chiari: mi sento soffocare se resto nello stesso posto per più di tre mesi; ho bisogno delle mie fughe durante il weekend (vicine o lontane); pianifico le vacanze per uno o due anni; mi dedico ad una ricerca meticolosa e preparo itinerari dettagliati per ogni viaggio; CondeNast Traveler, Culture Trip, National Geographic e Travel + Leisure sono diventati le mie bibbie; frequento anche siti come booking.com solo per sognare ad occhi aperti tutte quelle meravigliose destinazioni sparse per il mondo.

Dunque, perché ho deciso d'investire nei viaggi e non nelle cose? I motivi sono semplici:

AMPLIARE LA MIA PROSPETTIVA

Come disse giustamente Mark Twain, il viaggio è fatale al pregiudizio, al bigottismo e alla ristrettezza mentale. Due anni di incarico diplomatico ad Haiti mi hanno aperto la mente su un piano completamente diverso. Certo, si possono vedere le difficoltà dei paesi in via di sviluppo in TV, ma finché non le tocchi con mano, non potrai mai comprendere davvero le battaglie quotidiane di quella gente. Per fortuna, le nostre condizioni di vita ad Haiti non avevano nulla a che vedere con quelle di chi vive nella povertà più assoluta. Tuttavia, lì iniziai ad apprezzare anche le cose più semplici come le strade asfaltate, i semafori, i supermercati, i cinema e i centri commerciali – in pratica, tutto ciò che prima davo per scontato.

FARE NUOVE AMICIZIE

Ammirare le principali attrazioni del luogo non è abbastanza per me. Resto sempre a bocca aperta quando penso a quelle persone che, pur vivendo da anni in un altro paese, non hanno amici del posto. Non credo si possa imparare qualcosa su una nazione e sulla sua cultura senza interagire con la gente del luogo. Il coinvolgimento multiculturale è la chiave per capire la bellezza di questo mondo, ed avere tanti amici sparsi per il pianeta mi fa sentire ricca. Oltre a permetterti di conoscere le persone del paese ospitante, il viaggio ti offre anche l'opportunità d'interagire con altre nazionalità e scoprire qualcosa in più sulla loro cultura. Ricorda, ogni persona che incontri durante i tuoi viaggi ha una storia da raccontare.

CONOSCERE NUOVE CULTURE

Potrebbe essere una festa alle Hawaii, una visita alla Grande Muraglia cinese, una notte trascorsa in un tempio buddista in Giappone, un'immersione a Saint Kitts, un torneo di sumo a Tokyo , un safari nel deserto a Dubai: le possibilità d'immergersi nella cultura locale della meta prescelta sono infinite. L'emozione di vedere da vicino come vivono i popoli di altre nazioni, e provare le stesse esperienze che fanno battere i loro cuori, è incomparabile. Mentre giri per il mondo alla ricerca di nuovi odori, panorami e suoni, la comprensione profonda del mondo e delle nuove culture, così diverse dalla tua, ti apre la mente e ti arricchisce.

SCOPRIRE NUOVE PERLE CULINARIE.

Non è un segreto che amo il buon cibo e m'impegno sempre a provare la cucina locale ovunque io vada. Per quanto si tenti di ricreare le ricette originali, le pietanze non saranno mai buone come nel paese d'origine, semplicemente perché i prodotti locali e le spezie non possono essere riprodotti dappertutto. Il Khachapuri non sarà mai buono come quello preparato nella cucina di mia madre a Tblisi, il cibo thai non avrà mai lo stesso sapore che ha in Thailandia, e quello indiano non ti farà mai venire l'acquolina in bocca come in India. Ricordo ancora il nostro ""food tour"" da capogiro a San Juan, dove gustammo le specialità locali girando per le strade acciottolate. La nostra esperienza più recente è stata provare la cucina del Sichuan in un piccolo chiosco alla buona di uno sconosciuto villaggio cinese, sulla strada verso la Città Proibita. Era economico, semplice, ma strepitoso.

PER NON GUARDARMI INDIETRO E CHIEDERMI: ""E SE...?""

La vita è troppo breve e, alla fin fine, le uniche ""cose"" che resteranno con me per sempre sono tutte le avventure vissute e i bei ricordi condivisi con le persone amate. Non voglio rimandare niente che non possa fare oggi, questo mese o quest'anno. Non voglio guardarmi indietro e avere dei rimpianti o pensare ""Vorrei essere stata lì, aver fatto questo, ecc..."". A dirla tutta, non credo che questa passione per i viaggi mi abbandonerà mai. Avrò sempre quel desiderio di fare le valigie e prenotare un volo per una destinazione esotica. Non credo esistano risposte giuste o sbagliate sul modo di vivere la propria vita. Fare ciò che ci sembra giusto in un momento preciso è la risposta migliore probabilmente, perché non sappiamo cosa ci riserverà il domani.

GBS is a bacteria that occurs naturally in the lower vaginal tract and is carried by about 150,000 pregnant women each year in the UK. Most will suffer no ill effects, but in some cases they will pass the bacteria on to their baby during labour. Most babies exposed to GBS will be unaffected, but in around one in every 2,000 cases they can become infected.

A maternal vaccine could prevent 231,000 infant and maternal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) cases a year, the first global study of the bacteria has found.

The study led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) estimates that one in five pregnant women around the world carry GBS, and that out of 410,000 GBS cases every year, there will be at least 147,000 stillbirths and infant deaths globally.

Although several vaccines to prevent this cause of maternal and infant ill health and death are in development, none are currently available.

This is despite the disease accounting for more than the combined neonatal deaths from tetanus, pertussis, and respiratory syncytial virus, for which maternal vaccines are already in use, or further advanced in development, the report’s authors state.

The analysis - funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases - shows for the first time that a GBS vaccine which was 80% effective and reached 90% of women, could potentially prevent 231,000 infant and maternal GBS cases.

Global Statistics An average of 18% of women worldwide carry GBS bacteria. This is equivalent to 21.7million women in 195 countries The top five countries are: India 2,466,500

China 1,934,900

Nigeria 1,060,000

USA 942,800

Indonesia 799,100

It is possible to screen all pregnant women for GBS, so those carrying it can be given antibiotics, but this is “not recommended” by the UK’s National Screening Committee (NSC), unless women are considered to be at risk - such as having previously given birth to a baby with the infection or going into labour prematurely.

Dan and Birgitta Hobster’s daughter Natalie was just seven days old when she succumbed to meningitis caused by GBS in London last month.

Dan told HuffPost UK: “My wife is American and we were very keen to have a birth at the Portland [private hospital], but we were told it’s not the done thing because if there’s ever an emergency you need to be transferred to an NHS hospital straight away. So we didn’t do that.

“But basically, if she was born in America or frankly if she was born in any developed country anywhere else in the world, or in the Portland, this test would have occurred, they would have given her antibiotics and they would have caught it.

“We had never heard of it. The NHS needs to inform pregnant women of this risk.”

UK Statistics In 2015, 173,000 (one in four) pregnant women were estimated to be at risk from GBS. There were 856 cases of invasive GBS in infants under the age of three months over a 13 month period in the UK and Republic of Ireland from 2014 -2015. BPSU report states case fatality rate was 6.2% in babies aged 0-90 days - early onset (0-6 days) case fatality rate was 5.2% and late onset (7-90 days) was 7.7%.

Dan added: “When Natalie died we went away to Portugal and they said ‘we’ve never had this incident because we always do this test.’

“It’s tremendously arrogant for the UK to be like ‘we know better than all of the medical consensus of the rest of the world.’”","Maternal Vaccine Could Prevent 231,000 GBS Cases In Babies And Pregnant Women A Year",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maternal-vaccine-could-prevent-231000-gbs-cases-a-year_uk_59fc8aa4e4b0415a420b51d5?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Police forces in England and Wales recorded 6,238 underage sexting offences between 2016 and 2017, a rate of 17 offences per day, according to the BBC. This figure marks a huge 131% rise since the same period in 2014. Not only is the problem increasing in frequency, but the age of children affected is dropping, with many reports from children under ten years old. And in July it was reported that a five-year-old boy from County Durham had become the youngest person in the UK to be investigated for the crime, after taking a picture of himself on an iPad and sending it to another child.

Zoe Hilton, Head of safeguarding at the National Crime Agency, told HuffPost UK: “With smartphones and tablets, and new apps emerging all the time, this behaviour is becoming quite normal for teenagers. It can be alarming for mum and dad who might not know how to help when things go wrong.” So how should parents be dealing with this problem? What Is Sexting? The UK government defines sexting as the exchange of sexual messages or images and creating, sharing and forwarding sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images through mobile phones and the internet. How Common Is Sexting? According to research by NSPCC, around one in seven young people admitted to having taken a semi-naked/naked picture of themselves. Over 50% then went on to share the picture with someone else via the internet. What Is The Law Around Sexting? A study by the NSPCC revealed that 50% of parents do not know it is illegal for their child to take nude selfies. A young person (under 16 years old) is breaking the law if they: Take an explicit photo or video of themselves or someone else.

Share an explicit image or video of a child, even shared between people of the same age.

Possess, download or store these images .

Although it may seem harmless, under UK law creating or sharing explicit images of a child is illegal, even if the person doing it is a child.

As of January 2016, if a young person is found creating or sharing images, the police can choose to record that a crime has been committed but that taking formal action isn’t in the public interest. Although this doesn’t stop sexting being illegal. How Do I Talk To My Child About Sexting? Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC told The Huffington Post UK: “Of course, talking about sexting can be an embarrassing or awkward conversation for both parents and children.” But Wanless explained that a worrying statistic showed that 50% of parents weren’t confident about getting the right support to talk to their child. And this needs to change. Suzie Hayman trustee of Family Lives shared tips for parents: Have a plan: “Having a plan will make your life easier. Rather than waiting for something bad to happen, think about when and how you are going to start and keep the conversation going about the risks and rewards of the online world.” Pick a time with no pressure: “Avoid starting a conversation just as your child is going to bed or walking out the door. Use a storyline from an article or TV programme to start up the conversation about this.” Get to know their friends’ parents: “They’ll probably share your concerns, so you could agree on rules around technology and supervision. You can also share anecdotes about the questions your children have asked, which might help you prepare for your own conversations.” Do not dismiss sexist language or behaviour as funny: “Remember that you need to be a role model for them and they will look to you to determine what is right and what is wrong.” Let them know about the risk: “That taking, sharing or sending images of themselves could be shown to others or distributed online and there will be little they can do to stop this.”

She is currently consulting with lawyers about whether she should be pressing criminal charges, but she believes other measures, such as mediation, could perhaps be considered.

Jordaan is likely to get away with the alleged rape because of his position in society, Ferguson believes.

""We're not likely to get any form of legal action. Civil action is based on the balance of probabilities, so it is slightly more balanced,"" Ferguson said.

Jordaan apparently said no to and has been ""very condescending"" of her suggestion that he considers ""a restorative-justice mediation process"".

""In court, we don't own our stories anymore, and you don't write the ending of your story. When we are doing it within conversation, within mediation, we hold the dignity of the ownership of our story.""

She highlights how impersonal courts are when it comes to rape.

""In court, we don't own our stories anymore, and you don't write the ending of your story. When we are doing it within conversation, within mediation, we hold the dignity of the ownership of our story.""

She also places emphasis on the idea that legal processes cannot ""honour victims' vulnerability"".

The singer first made the allegations in a blog entry she posted in October 2017, giving sensitive and explicit details of the incident, which allegedly happened two decades ago.

Following the post, many women came out in support of Ferguson, and three other women came forward saying they were also victims of Jordaan's abuse.

After a long silence, Jordaan spoke out about the matter last week denying the allegations and welcoming any criminal proceedings instituted against him.

He said his son after completing his Class 12 got admitted to the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, a government-founded autonomous institute in Rae Bareli – the Lok Sabha constituency of Rahul Gandhi's mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

""Rahul Gandhi made it possible. He looked after us after the incident,"" the father said, referring to the December 16 night when his daughter was brutally gang-raped.

""He (Gandhi) helped us emotionally. He helped us in many ways. He helped us monetarily. Otherwise, you can understand how was it possible for us to make our son a pilot.""

He said the Congress leader used to counsel his son regularly and motivated him to do something good in his life and support the family.

The young woman's friend was knocked down with an iron rod while Nirbhaya was raped by the five men and the teenaged youth on the moving bus. The two were flung, bleeding by a roadside. The brutality of the rape and the woman's death in a Singapore hospital on December 29 sparked off nationwide protests.

Damrey reached land at 4 a.m. local time (2100 GMT on Friday) with winds gusting at up to 90 kmph (56 mph) that tore off more than 1,000 roofs, knocked down hundreds of electricity poles and uprooted trees.

At least 12 people were missing and over 370 houses had collapsed, the Communist state's search and rescue committee said. Over 33,000 people had been evacuated.

The government earlier said six ships had capsized with 61 people on board in the South China Sea and that 25 people had been rescued, but gave no details as to the possible fate of the others.

The storm made landfall near the city of Nha Trang, which is around 500 km (310 miles) south of the coastal city of Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place next week.

There were reports of high winds and rain in Danang, but no immediate reports of casualties. The city will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10 as well as China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing area of the world's biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. Traders had expected the storm to delay harvesting, but were not sure whether it would damage the crop.

The government said more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations. More than 40 flights were cancelled.

By Ashok Kumar*, Gumla, Jharkhand

In the first week of July, Birla Khariya from Silam village in Jharkhand, was busy planting robust tomato seedlings in his fields. He had bought 3,500 seedlings from Michael Ekka, who runs a vegetable nursery in a nearby hamlet. Earlier, Khariya used to buy a 10 gm pack of seeds to grow his own seedlings; but since last year, he has been purchasing from Ekka's nursery.

""Seedlings from Michael's nursery are resilient, treated and of genuine varieties,"" Khariya told VillageSquare.in. ""Apart from seedlings, the other farm inputs are also available at Michaels' place on easy credit."" Khariya finds it convenient; it also eliminates the risk of nursery failure.

Reduced risk and the convenience of getting many services at their doorsteps have enabled farmers like Khariya from Raidih block of Gumla district to gradually increase the area under vegetable crops. This has encouraged agricultural entrepreneurs like Ekka to introduce more services and innovative ideas that not only help their business but also help the farmers earn more.

Beyond Subsistence Farming

Raidih is an administrative block in the southwestern part of Gumla district in Jharkhand. Raidih is home to about 13,600 families, 65% of them being tribal people, as accounted by the Gumla District Census Handbook - 2011. Around 10,000 families have landholding of less than two hectares (ha).

Of the 30,500 ha of cultivated area, only 6% is irrigated. This implies that rain-fed rice cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the residents of Raidih block. The area gets about 1200 mm of rainfall every year spread over some 70 rainy days. Depending on rain-fed farming makes residents of Raidih practice only subsistence farming.

This and the absence of non-farm enterprises force them to migrate to distant cities in search of jobs and cash income. The younger generation also finds farming an unpredictable occupation and feels that cities hold better opportunities for them. Despite the capricious agricultural production system, the migrants return home during the rainy season to cultivate their fields. Clearly, they have an affinity towards farming and living at home.

Utilizing Opportunities

Located at around 650m above sea level, Raidih enjoys a mild climate. With a rolling topography and well-drained soil, it has a huge potential for subtropical crops, including vegetables, even in rainy season. This unique biophysical feature holds a good prospect for smallholders.

During the rainy season, the surrounding agriculturally progressive areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar are inundated and vegetables cannot be grown. Sensing this opportunity, some farmers started growing vegetables with support from organizations such as PRADAN (Professional Assistance for Development Action), a grassroots organization. As vegetables are in demand during the monsoons, the farmers find a good market.

Michael Ekka in his 40s is an active farmer from Silam Patratoli village of Raidih block. He is eager to learn and adopt new things in agriculture and has a general concern about the socioeconomic condition of his fellow villagers. Michael is supporting villagers to move towards prosperity from farming by becoming an agricultural-entrepreneur, or agripreneur.

One-Stop Shop

An agripreneur is like a one-stop shop in the village. He provides agricultural inputs, high quality vegetable seedlings, mechanized plowing devices like power tillers, small credit for farm inputs through microfinance institutions and information related to farming, besides facilitating collective marketing of vegetables and mangoes. This monsoon, Ekka helped 180 farmers grow vegetables for markets as far as Ranchi and Rourkela.

Michael was identified by the women's SHG (self-help group) of his village to take part in the agri- entrepreneurship program run by Transform Rural India (TRI), in collaboration with Syngenta Foundation India. Michael participated in several training programs on agriculture technology, achievement motivation, and business management among others. The training helped him build his perspective around agriculture, and he could see the opportunity for an enterprise around aggregating inputs demand and output marketing from the local area.

Michael understands that creating an ecosystem around the smallholders is important to sustain them in gainful farming. The rural tribal areas are acutely deficient in products and services required for profitable farming. The present scale and diffusion of agriculture technology is not attractive for conventional markets. Local entrepreneurship is essential to aggregate the demand and supply of farm inputs, services and outputs. It has to sustain the agripreneur, as well as help him stay competitive in the local market.

Challenges

Commitments are major challenges that Michael faces. Sometimes farmers do not take delivery of the ordered inputs or seedlings. When prices of produce are low, farmers dump the produce at Ekka's place, but when prices are high, they sell directly in the markets. After Ekka started taking advance for supply orders, the issue of farmers not taking the ordered inputs has reduced.

Providing assured supplies is still a challenge, but with increasing area under production by farmers, it is slowly being solved. With increased production, the quantity of produce is beyond a farmer's capacity to sell in the local market. So they rely on people such as Michael. Simultaneously, he tries to aggregate and market other local produce like jackfruits, mangoes and rice to keep his revenues right.

Pioneering New Ideas

Being closely associated with Mahila Vikas Mandal, an SHG federation, Michael was aware that his village is in a kharif tomato production cluster. More than 300 farmers around his village grow kharif hybrid tomatoes. So he started a nursery in kharif of 2016, producing 50,000 tomato seedlings. He used a bamboo frame structure with mesh nylon net to protect the seedlings from heavy downpours, insects and stray animals.

The demand for seedlings outstripped supply. Subsequently he produced two batches of seedlings for vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, chili and eggplant, booking a profit of about Rs 50,000 this year. His efforts drew the attention of the district agriculture department, and he bagged a commercial greenhouse for flower cultivation, where he grows gerbera. Michael also applied for and successfully obtained a seed and fertilizer dealer license.

In 2017, sensing the demand, Michael expanded his business, producing chili and brinjal seedlings in kharif, besides the tomato. He also got power tillers and mechanized paddy thrasher from the village organization (VO) and started lending services. His seed and fertilizer shop is also doing well, the turnover by July being more than Rs 70,000. From selling paddy seeds and fertilizers, he expects to make about Rs 30,000 by the end of the kharif season. The first batch of 60,000 seedlings was sold out and he was preparing the next batch.

In the summer of 2017, he provided collective marketing services for mangoes. Michael supplied mangoes to Ranchi and charged Rs 0.30 per kg from the farmers. The farmers were happy because the price was good, weighing was accurate, and it was a doorstep supply facility. For efficient marketing services, Michael has 250 plastic crates at his center for grading of produce, transparent weighing and easy transportation.

Michael is using a smartphone-based application Kushal Kisan, developed by TRI, to register farmers, facilitate crop planning and manage inputs delivery as well as providing credit through microfinance institution.

Facilitating Change

There are 22 such agripreneurs offering services similar to Michael's. In addition, they anchor access to micro irrigation. They are opening new frontiers like introducing kharif onions and flowers in their area. There are another 69 people in the process of becoming agripreneurs in three administrative blocks of Jharkhand.

Attracted by this rewarding enterprise, Michael's son has joined him in this journey of driving prosperity in the local area. ""My son has returned home from Himachal,"" Michael told VillageSquare.in happily. His son takes active interest in the farm equipment lending center and the vegetable nursery business.

In Michael's region, the expected returns are about Rs 2 million a year. It is evident that enabling the local entrepreneurs with relevant perspective, skills, linkages and mentoring support, it is possible to intensify the local production system profitably, sustain the local entrepreneurs, and stem migration.

NEW DELHI -- The Supreme Court today sought the government's response on four petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act and linking of bank accounts and mobile numbers with the 12-digit biometric identification number.

The apex court did not pass any interim order in the matter saying that final hearing in all Aadhaar-related issues would start before another bench in the last week of this month and the Centre has already extended the deadline till December 31.

A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, however, said that the banks and telecom service providers should indicate the last date of linking bank accounts and mobile numbers with Aadhaar in the messages sent by them to their customers.

""We make it clear that in the messages sent by banks and telecom service providers, the date of December 31, 2017 and February 6, 2018, shall also be indicated as the last date of linking Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers,"" the bench said.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, referred to a recently filed affidavit by the Centre and said the government has said the deadline for linking Aadhaar may be extended till March 31, 2018.

The bench, however, said the petitioners can raise this issue before the court which would hear all Aadhaar-related matters in the last week of November.

""There is no doubt that these arguments need consideration. The matter is going to come up in the last week of November and the time (to link Aadhaar with bank accounts) has been extended till December 31,"" the bench said.

On October 30, a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra had said that a constitution bench would be constituted and Aadhaar-related matters would come up for hearing before it in November last.

Several petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing various services and benefits of welfare schemes have been filed in the apex court.

Recently, a nine-judge constitution bench of the apex court had held that Right to Privacy was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution. Several petitioners challenging the validity of Aadhaar had claimed it violated privacy rights.

The Centre had on October 25 told the top court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number and were willing to enroll for it.

Some petitioners in the top court have termed the linking of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number with bank accounts and mobile numbers as ""illegal and unconstitutional"".

They have also objected to the CBSE's alleged move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for students appearing for examinations, a contention denied by the Centre.

One of the counsel representing the petitioners had earlier said the final hearing in the main Aadhaar matter, which is pending before the apex court, was necessary as the government ""cannot compel"" citizens to link their Aadhaar with either bank accounts or cell phone numbers.",SC Refuses Interim Stay On Linking Aadhar Number To Bank Accounts And Mobile Numbers,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/sc-refuses-interim-stay-on-linking-aadhar-number-to-bank-accounts-and-mobile-numbers_a_23265414/

One post detailed alleged sexual assault, while the other accused seven alleged attackers, based on a compilation of stories. Both social media posts named DJ Zachary Webb — who took his own life on Oct. 17. It's unknown if Webb was aware of the claims, noted the newspaper.

Such very public accusations sparked debate about the right to speak out balanced with someone's right to due process. Defamation lawyer Alan McConchie said a ""mass movement"" like #MeToo can lead to a dangerous flood of second-hand allegations.

Yeah, the twist that Cate Blanchett’s character, Hela, was Thor’s sister got out before the movie premiered on Friday, and Mark Ruffalo accidentally live-streamed the movie at an early screening, but many of the film’s secrets remain intact, including some major cameos.

Warning: “Thor: Ragnarok” spoilers below!

After Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets back to Asgard, where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been ruling in an Odin (Anthony Hopkins) disguise after secretly exiling the real Odin, Thor witnesses a play honoring Loki’s “death,” which happened in “Thor: The Dark World.” (Don’t worry. The dude wasn’t really dead.)

In the play scenes, Thor is played by Luke Hemsworth, Chris’ older brother; Odin is played by Dr. Grant himself, Sam Neill; and Loki is played by Matt Damon wearing a ridiculous Loki wig.

Director Taika Waititi told HuffPost the Damon cameo really happened because he’s good friends with Chris.

“It was like an homage to the previous films but also being a bit more irreverent, being able to poke fun at ourselves,” he said in reference to the play scene. “Chris is very good at that. He has great self-deprecating humor.”

The director said the play was planned as an in-joke for everyone who saw “Thor: The Dark World,” adding, “We shot everything the same size and the same angle and we basically copied the entire death scene from that movie.”

For those who haven’t seen the previous “Thor” film, Waititi says it is still an “interesting piece of story” that helps set up Loki’s storyline.

As far as the other surprises in the movie, you should probably just see them for yourself. Marvel has gone to great lengths to keep them quiet. Even the trailers were digitally altered from the final film to hide plot points.

“When we came out with our first trailer, there were a few stories in we weren’t sure if we wanted in the film or not,” said Waititi. The director said they just “wanted to make a cool trailer,” but promotion “shouldn’t necessarily be just showing shots from the finished movie.”

Die belgische Justiz hat nun 60 Tage Zeit, über die Auslieferung zu entscheiden

Der abgesetzte katalanische Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont hat sich in Belgien den Behörden gestellt. Dies bestätigte die Staatsanwaltschaft in Brüssel am Sonntag. Die Regierung in Madrid hatte einen Europäischen Fahndungs- und Haftbefehl gegen den 54-Jährigen sowie vier Ex-Minister der Regionalregierung erlassen, die sich nach Brüssel abgesetzt hatten.

Die fünf Katalanen sollten noch am Sonntag einem Untersuchungsrichter vorgeführt werden. Dieser habe dann bis Montagmorgen Zeit zu entscheiden, ob die Beschuldigten festgehalten werden. Spätester Zeitpunkt sei 9.17 Uhr am Montagmorgen, sagte ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft auf einer Pressekonferenz in Brüssel am Sonntagnachmittag.

Das weitere rechtliche Prozedere könnte sich über Wochen hinziehen: Wird der Haftbefehl aufrecht erhalten, hat das Gericht dann weitere 15 Tage Zeit, über eine Abschiebung zu entscheiden.

Belgische Justiz hat 60 Tage Zeit, über Auslieferung zu entscheiden

Sowohl die Staatsanwaltschaft als auch die betroffenen Personen können dann Einspruch einlegen. Über den Einspruch muss ebenfalls binnen 15 Tagen entschieden werden. Ein weiterer Einspruch beim belgischen Revisionsgericht ist möglich.

Nach den EU-Regeln hat die belgische Justiz 60 Tage Zeit, über die Auslieferung zu entscheiden - lediglich in Ausnahmefällen kann die Frist um weitere 30 Tage verlängert werden.

Puigdemont und seinen Mitstreitern drohen in Spanien lange Haftstrafen. Ihnen werden von der Justiz Rebellion, Auflehnung gegen die Staatsgewalt und Unterschlagung öffentlicher Gelder vorgeworfen. Grund dafür ist die einseitige Unabhängigkeitserklärung, die das katalanische Parlament am Freitag vor einer Woche beschlossen hatte.

Die Zentralregierung von Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy hatte die katalanische Regierung daraufhin abgesetzt. Die wirtschaftsstarke Region im Nordosten Spaniens steht nun unter Zwangsverwaltung aus Madrid. Für den 21. Dezember setzte Rajoy Neuwahlen an.

Puigdemont war bereits vor der Anklageerhebung nach Brüssel ausgereist.

Figuratively and literally, the honeymoon is not over for us. The truth is, we never planned to catch that plane home to a mundane life and an uninspiring relationship.

Numerous articles have been written about the key to keeping the pizzazz in relationships, and even more articles have dissected the apparently unavoidable tragedy that occurs when the honeymoon period of a relationship comes to an abrupt end.

But what if the honeymoon period never ends?

After a solid decade of exploring all corners of the globe together, my partner and I decided to embark on a new adventure: marriage and children. I could almost hear my mum's sigh of relief when we announced it... Finally, she thought, she'll stop wasting her money, start saving for a house, have kids and live happily ever after.

Unfortunately for my mum, marriage and kids did nothing to quench our thirst for exploring, and despite setting up shop with the kids, the travelling never stopped. In fact, we went into overdrive. In an almost defiant, rebellious quest, we continued to travel the world with two young kids in tow -- mastering the art of travelling with a glass of bubbles in one hand and a bottle of milk in the other (responsibly, of course).

We were determined to prove wrong all the people who insisted that life, romance and fabulous holidays would end as soon as marriage and kids entered the equation. And so, we kept travelling... mostly with the kids and, on one rare occasion, without them.

Nothing deterred us, not even that nightmare 22-hour flight to Europe when my two year old refused to sleep. Our combined obsession with travel motivated us to book that next holiday. And with each adventure, whether it was the camping trip just out of town or the tropical getaway on a luxurious island, we realised we had inadvertently managed to stay in the honeymoon phase simply by continuing to go on 'honeymoons' -- with the kids.

A honeymoon with kids?

Okay, so it's not your typical honeymoon. The traditional honeymoon is synonymous with the ultimate celebration of love. Usually taken immediately after the wedding, it's that once-in-a-lifetime romantic holiday where you deliriously succumb to life's little luxuries and the term 'love drunk' takes on a whole new meaning.

However, if you look beyond the indulgent hotel rooms and the token petals scattered over beds, you'll realise the essence of a honeymoon can easily be applied to any holiday. It's about exploring together, discovering together, going to new places together, sharing new experiences together and (this is the real ground-breaking one)... it's about spending time together.

Honeymoons and holidays embody the all-important 'together' things that people tend to forget when kids come along or when they've been in a relationship for years. They are shoved right under a one-metre pile of bills, never to be seen again. That's when the ever-so-feared domestication truly starts to set in and you can guarantee the honeymoon phase will well and truly be over shortly afterwards.

So as Nike always recommends, just do it. Keep the adventures going, keep 'honeymooning' and don't be afraid to take the kids with you. There may be fleeting moments of despair but the good times will far outweigh the bad. The excitement of going somewhere new will help rekindle the romance in your relationship, and provide family memories that will last a lifetime.

Here are our top five places to honeymoon with the kids:

1. Mykonos -- Synonymous with hedonistic parties, it's not the first Greek Island that springs to mind when you think of romance and family holidays, but this charming island has everything for everyone. Romantic bars (kids were always warmly welcomed), fabulous restaurants and crystal-clear waters, topped with that infectious and fun Greek spirit.

2. Vomo, Fiji -- This luxurious Fijian resort, only a short boat or helicopter ride from Fiji's mainland, has all the elements of a blissful tropical getaway -- picture-perfect beaches framed with palm trees, amazing food and hospitality, and a fantastic kids club with island activities to keep the little ones learning and engaged.

3. Bali -- From the stunning properties of Alila Villas on the cliffs of Uluwatu, to the many affordable hotels and villas along Seminyak and Kuta, Bali offers something for all budgets. The sunsets are some of the most famed in the world and provide the perfect setting for sunset cocktails.

4. Port Douglas -- This charming town in Tropical North Queensland is uniquely positioned where the 'rainforest meets the sea'. The spectacular natural scenery, coupled with world-class eateries means there is always plenty to see and do. Explore the Daintree Rainforest, take a boat ride out and snorkel the Great Barrier Reef or simply relax by the pool at one of the many waterfront resorts.

5. Seal Rocks -- Lush surrounds including endless beaches and bushwalks makes this area the ideal place to unwind and get some quality time together. There are fantastic camping spots -- the perfect activity to enjoy a glass of wine under the stars as the kids sleep.

Happy honeymooning, with the kids.

Emily Eekhoff bemerkte, dass sich ihr ungeborenes Baby plötzlich anders in ihrem Bauch bewegt

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Radioaktive Elemente im Grundwasser

Zwar sind die Level von Caesium und Plutonium seit den 1970er-Jahren gesunken, doch regelmäßige Messungen des Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) zeigen, dass diese radioaktiven Substanzen immer noch in Sedimenten und dem Grundwasser gespeichert bleiben und heraussickern.

In ihren Messungen fanden die Forscher auch heraus , dass der Plutoniumgehalt in den betroffenen Lagunen 100 Mal höher ist, als im ganzen restlichen Pazifik. Die Caesiumbelastung war ungefähr doppelt so hoch.

Im Runit Dome lagern Unmengen an radioaktivem Boden

Im Zuge der Studie untersuchten die Wissenschaftler auch den Runit Dome. Hier wurden in den Jahren 1977 bis 1980 100.000 Kubikmeter radioaktiver Boden von allen Inseln des Atolls in einen Explosionskrater gefüllt und mit einer Zementkuppel überdeckt, um das Material zu isolieren. Doch der tiefste Punkt ist unter dem Meeresspiegel und wurde nicht in dem, Ausmaß gesichert.

Die Wissenschaftler sind nun besorgt, dass radioaktive Versickerungen in das Meer gelangen könnten. Das scheint noch nicht passiert zu sein. Doch die Lage muss auf jeden Fall weiter beobachtet werden. Das Risiko besteht.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.
Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.","Seit nunmehr fast sieben Jahren hat P. einen Rechtsanspruch gegen das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis auf zusätzliche Kosten der Unterkunft in Höhe von 580,80 € (12 x 48,40 €), die er aus seinen existenzsichernden Leistungen im Jahr 2010 vorgeleistet hat. Angeblich sei seine Wohnung in Iserlohn zu teuer für das Jobcenter. So hieß es damals.

Eine Gesetzesänderung in den Wohnraumnutzungsbestimmungen (WNB) NRW zum 01.01.2010 begünstigte Sozialleistungsbezieher dahingehend, dass fortan Wohnungen bis 50 m² als angemessen zu gelten hätten.

Davor waren es nur 45 m². Bereits die Differenz von 5 m² machten eine Entschädigungssumme von monatlich 25,05 € aus.

""Alleinstehende Bezieher von Hartz-IV-Leistungen haben in NRW Anspruch auf 50 qm Wohnfläche"" bestätigte das Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen (LSG NRW) in einem Urteil vom 16.5.2011 (L 19 AS 2202/10).

Das Ministerium für Arbeit, Integration und Soziales (MAIS) reagierte in einem Erlass vom 15.08.2012. Auch die Geschäftsführung des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis wurde über die veränderte Rechtslage in Kenntnis gesetzt und zur Korrektur bestandskräftiger Leistungsbescheide von Amts wegen verpflichtet.

In dem Erlass heißt es unmissverständlich:

""II. Von Amts wegen sind bestandskräftige Leistungsbescheide nach § 22 SGB II mit Wirkung für die Vergangenheit nach § 44 SGB X iVm. § 40 SGB II zurückzunehmen, wenn die Rechte der Leistungsberechtigten infolge der Nichtanwendung der ab dem 01 .01.2010 geltenden WNB betroffen und Leistungen nach § 22 SGB II zu Unrecht nicht erbracht worden sind. Ggf. reicht die Rückwirkung in der Regel bis zum 01.01.2011.""

Mittels Überprüfungsantrag gem. § 44 SGB X hatte P. Vorsorge getroffen, dass auch für das Jahr 2010 keine bestandskräftigen Leistungsbescheide vorliegen. Damit erweiterte sich sein Rechtsanspruch automatisch um ein Jahr.

Dazu kam noch die Tatsache, dass das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis über kein „schlüssiges Konzept"" für die Ermittlung der Kosten der Unterkunft verfügte. (Auch das aktuelle Konzept der Firma Analyse & Konzepte ist derzeit noch beim LSG (L 6 AS 120/17) anhängig.)

Bereits die Weisung MAIS war eine Rechtsverletzung in der Absicht der Vermögensschädigung für Tausende von Betroffenen im Jahr 2010.

In den Mühlen der Rechtsverdreher - Jobcenter verweigert Erstattung

Existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen gibt es anscheinend nur auf dem Klageweg.

In der Zeit vom 08.07.2011 bis zum 26.11.2013 führte P. zwei KDU-Klagen vor dem Sozialgericht in Dortmund. In dieser Zeit wechselten dreimal die zuständigen Richter.

Zuletzt musste das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis den erfolgreichen Rechtsanwalt und für die Bewilligungszeiträume vom 01.08.2011-31.01.2012 (S 19 AS 4056/11; W 578/11) und vom 01.02.2012-31.07.2012 (S 19 AS 308/12, W 83/12) 12 x 48,40 € = 580,80 € bezahlen.

Trotz ministerialer Weisung vom 15.08.2012 verweigerte das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis Jahre lang die von Amts wegen angeordnete Erstattung von Januar 2011 bis Juli 2011, also weitere 7 Monate á 48,40 € = 338,80 €.

Am Donnerstag, den 17.07.2014 wurde ein weiteres Hauptsacheverfahren über die Nachzahlung der KDU für das Jahr 2010 im Sozialgericht Dortmund unter Vorsitz der Richterin Sülow verhandelt. Dabei ging es um den Beweis des fristgerechten Zugangs zweier Überprüfungsanträge.

Als Behördenvertreterin des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis behauptete die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch. im Termin ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"". Diese Behauptung wurde ohne jeden belastbaren Beweis vorgetragen und völlig anhaltslos geglaubt.

Richterin Sülow schenkte der unbewiesenen Aussage mehr Glauben als dem Verfasser als Faxversender, obwohl nachweislich drei gesendete Faxe mit Datum, Uhrzeit und Nummer des Jobcenters an das Jobcenter Iserlohn gesandt worden waren.

Untätigkeitsklage trotz unstritigem Rechtsanspruch

Mit dieser Entwicklung hatte niemand gerechnet. 580,80 € verloren, weil die Jobcenter-Mitarbeiterin behauptete ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"".

Im Urteil des Sozialgericht Dortmund vom 17.07.2014 (S 19 AS 357/12) heißt es:

""Zur Begründung führt sie aus, ein Überprüfungsantrag vom 14.06.2011 sei dort weder bekannt noch zugegangen. Empfangsjournale des Faxgerätes mit der Nummer 02371/905799 für den 14.06.2011 seien bei dem Beklagten nicht mehr vorhanden.""

Damit wurde die Untätigkeitsklage für den Zeitraum 01.01.2010 bis 30.06.2011 über 48,40 € monatlich und damit insgesamt 871,20 Euro Existenzsichernde Leistungen abgewiesen, obwohl der Rechtsanspruch auf der Grundlage des WNB NRW unstrittig ist.

Spätere Recherchen zeichnen die Vorgänge jedoch klarer: Die Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags erfolgte durch die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch., die nicht einmal in dem Gebäude Friedrichstraße 59/61, sondern in der Brausestraße arbeitet, in dem das entsprechende Faxgerät steht.

Außerdem war wohl zum Zeitpunkt des Faxzugangs (21:37 Uhr) niemand mehr im Gebäude. Ob die betreffende Beklagtenvertreterin überhaupt nur einmal einen Faxeingang in der Hauptzentrale miterlebt hat? Von der Erfassung im ""Eingangsbuch"" ganz zu schweigen.

Als sicher gelten darf aber, dass die Reinigungskräfte das Büro häufiger betreten als die Wortführende ""Zeugin"" mit ihrer Behauptung.

Auch die Zeit der Faxübertragung, Dienstag, 14.06.2011 um 21:37 Uhr, lässt die Aussage der Jobcentervertreterin unglaubwürdig erscheinen.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.

Diese Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags wertete die Vorsitzende Richterin höher als die Aussage der Person, die das Fax versendet, die ordnungsgemäße Übertragung überprüft hat, die Eintragung der Übersendung eigens dokumentiert hat und anschließend den Überprüfungsantrag in den entsprechenden Ordner einlegt hat.

Berufungsverfahren bei Landessozialgericht in Essen

Am 03.04.2015 wurde eine Berufungsverhandlung beim LSG NRW verhandelt. Die Richter stellten auch einen gravierenden Rechtsverstoß in der Bescheidbearbeitung fest, was zu einer weiteren Nachzahlung von 338,80 € für die Zeit vom 01.01.2011-31.07.2011 führte, wollten aber keine Nachzahlung für das Jahr 2010 entscheiden.

Noch immer sind 580,80 € offen.

Und noch eine weitere Klagerunde

Nachdem weder das SG Dortmund noch das LSG NRW vollständig Abhilfe schaffen wollten, wurde ein drittes Mal in gleicher Sache der Rechtsweg über eine juristische Hintertür beschritten.



Am 01.07.2015 wurden zwei Überprüfungsanträge wegen der Ablehnungsbescheide vom 03.04.2012 & 16.04.2012 per Fax an je drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis (Fax: 02371 905-799; 905-848; 905-859) gesandt.

Um postalische Eingangsbestätigung der Überprüfungsanträge wurde ausdrücklich gebeten.

Am 03.08.2015, 31.08.2015, 05.10.2015, 28.10.2015, 30.11.2015 und 31.12.2015 erfolgten Erinnerungen. Zwei Faxe an jeweils drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis. - Ganz wie beim ersten Mal!

Siebenmal Sechs Fax-Anträge. Bei keinem der 42 Anträge erfolgte auch nur ein Bescheid. Nicht einmal eine Eingangsbestätigung. Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.

Inzwischen ist eine weitere Untätigkeitsklage (Az.: S 14 AS 1515/16) anhängig und die Überprüfungsanträge sind aus der Akte verschwunden.

Neuf mois de tweets, de scandales et de poignées de mains viriles plus tard, le milliardaire ne donne aucun signe d'un éventuel changement de cap. Et ce en dépit des menaces de destitution qui planent sur lui depuis les premières heures de son mandat.

Malgré l'affaire de ses liens présumés avec la Russie, l'accusation d'agression sexuelle qui pèse sur lui, sa complaisance avec les néo-nazis américains et un exercice de la fonction présidentielle profondément singulier... Donald Trump semble sortir renforcé de sa première année -ou presque- à la Maison Blanche.

Même s'il n'a pas réussi à concrétiser ses promesses emblématiques comme l'abrogation de l'Obamacare ou la fermeture des frontières américaines à certains pays musulmans, le président a profité de sa première année pour se renforcer politiquement, et donc, s'éloigner peu à peu de toutes menaces d'impeachment, malgré la volonté des Démocrates, de certains Républicains et même de personnalités publiques. ""Cela fait quelques temps que Trump gagne à tous les coups. Pour un novice en politique, il ne se débrouille pas mal du tout"", euphémise le spécialiste des États-Unis Jean Eric Branaa au HuffPost.

Trump soutenu par sa base

Le président américain profite de sa belle côté de popularité chez les électeurs républicains pour mettre sa formation politique -qui lui a longtemps été hostile- au pas. ""Donald Trump a tué le parti et il l'a mis sous tutelle"", explique l'historien, auteur du livre Trumpland - Portrait d'une Amérique divisée aux éditions Privat, qui cite pour exemple la nouvelle présidente des Républicains Ronna Romney McDaniel soutien inconditionnel de Donald Trump.

Malgré des premiers mois de mandature marqués notamment par de nombreux échecs, Donald Trump demeure très populaire chez ses soutiens de novembre 2016. Selon un sondage publié le 26 octobre 2017 par FoxNews, 83% des électeurs républicains sont satisfaits de l'action de leur président.

Une situation favorable qui permet au milliardaire de faire la pluie et le beau temps dans les rangs des républicains, les seuls a pouvoir voter une procédure d'impeachment du fait de leur position majoritaire au Sénat. ""Si les élus veulent le soutien du parti républicain, ils doivent rentrer dans le rang (...) ceux qui ne sont plus soutenus par le président américain se retrouvent marginalisés"" au sein de leur parti et prennent donc le risque de disparaître politiquement, explique Jean-Eric Branaa, pour qui Donald Trump a fait taire toutes ""les grandes voix"" dissonantes de sa formation politique, à l'image de Mitt Romney ou Chris Christie.

D'autant que le pays entre peu à peu en période électorale. Le 6 novembre 2018, les 435 sièges de la chambre des représentants seront renouvelés ainsi qu'un tiers des sénateurs, à l'occasion des élections de mi-mandat.

Les Démocrates entre deux feux

Une situation qui fragilise les opposants internes à Donald Trump et qui dissipe, de fait, la menace d'une quelconque procédure de destitution éventuellement lancée depuis les rangs des Républicains. Côté démocrate, la situation n'est pas simple non plus. En quête de leaders depuis la défaite d'Hillary Clinton et le retrait de Barack Obama, le parti peine à trouver une figure emblématique pouvant incarner l'opposition à Donald Trump.

Et les choses sont parties pour durer jusqu'aux élections de mi-mandat. Pour le spécialiste des Etats-Unis, les républicains devraient accroître leur domination au Sénat - comme le montrent les résultats des élections partielles - mais perdre la chambre des représentants au profit de leur rival. Une situation politique qui pourrait voir les deux camps se radicaliser. En cas de victoire à la chambre basse, les démocrates auront tout le loisir de lancer une procédure d'impeachment contre le président américain. Seulement, ils se heurteraient à un Sénat - chambre qui doit voter ou non la destitution - acquis à Donald Trump.

Avant de lancer une quelconque procédure, qui pourrait aboutir à l'humiliation de leur parti et à terme à une réélection du milliardaire, les démocrates doivent convaincre la frange modérée des républicains. Sans quoi Donald Trump pourrait se retrancher derrière une attitude de victimisation qu'il connaît bien, pour se présenter souvent ""seul contre tous"" devant les Américains.

Ce qu'il manque

L'opposition, si elle souhaite destituer Donald Trump, doit donc trouver un ou plusieurs motifs anticonstitionnels pour convaincre certains Républicains de lâcher leur chef. Ce qui n'a pas été le cas depuis l'élection du milliardaire malgré plusieurs scandales qui ont touché son administration. Et si aucune des accusations portées à l'encontre de Donald Trump ne se concrétise, les sénateurs républicains pourraient s'arc-bouter davantage encore autour de la défense très solide du président américains.

Une situation qui pourrait durer, en dépit de la tentaculaire affaire russe qui semble se rapprocher peu à peu de Donald Trump. Si plusieurs membres de son entourage plus ou moins proche sont impliqués, ""le président américain n'est pour le moment accusé de rien"", rappelle Jean-Eric Branaa. Qui plus est, il ne faut pas s'attendre, selon lui, à ce que les conclusions de l'enquête de Robert Mueller ""ne sortent avant les prochaines élections.""

En revanche, les nombreuses ""collusions"" des Trump ""avec le monde des affaires"" pourraient compliquer les prochains mois et les prochaines années de mandature du milliardaire. Pour l'historien Jean-Eric Branaa, ""il y a des zones d'ombre dans la fortune de Trump"". La nomination de ses fils à la tête de l'empire économique ""Trump Organization"" au lendemain de son élection n'est pas de nature à éclaircir ces doutes. ""Si on se rend compte que Donald Trump franchit la limite, il pourrait y avoir un motif d'impeachment"", estime le spécialiste des Etats-Unis. Ce n'est d'ailleurs pas pour rien que les démocrates ne cessent de demander la publication détaillée de la fortune du président américain.","Pourquoi s'il poursuit sur la lancée de sa première année, Trump ne se fera pas destituer (et ce qu'il faudrait pour que ça arrive)",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/11/05/pourquoi-sil-poursuit-sur-la-lancee-de-sa-premiere-annee-trump-ne-se-fera-pas-destituer-et-ce-quil-faudrait-pour-que-ca-arrive_a_23258586/

Yet from the beginning, the first-ever American Idol says, record labels and executives have tried to define who she is as both a person and musician.

“Honestly, you can look at my previous records and you can hear a suppressed individual,” Clarkson told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “I just constantly felt pushed into a box.”

Atlantic Records Kelly Clarkson says it has taken 15 years to be “allowed” to release new album Meaning of Life.

Throughout her career, Clarkson’s struggle for creative liberation has been tabloid fodder. She dropped Idol’s 19 Management team, then went toe-to-toe with former industry giant Clive Davis to gain greater freedom in her sound. Sometimes there were victories, she said; other times, she had to “compromise.”

A deciding factor in her need to “bend” to corporate pressure was the band and team supporting her. Had she pushed back too much, she told listeners of Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ podcast, the label would “sit on” her music and prevent touring, presenting a financial burden for those with whom she has worked with for nearly a decade.

“You carry this weight on you to keep everyone afloat,” Clarkson confessed. “I feel everything. It’s annoying.”

The superstar recalled a conversation years ago with her equally famous mother-in-law Reba McIntyre. Though conceding she, too, feels the burden of celebrity, the country music legend told Clarkson: “You’re just a different type of personality. You take on everything.”

Fortunately, it appears Clarkson’s “devastating” battle for artistic authenticity is behind her. Now signed to Atlantic Records, she dropped eighth album Meaning of Life Oct. 27. Not only does she feel it’s her best work to date, it’s also proven to be a relief.

“When you are that type of person – an emotional person, in a good way – it’s really wonderful to be part of a project that’s 100-percent you, 100-percent your personality and no one is holding you back,” Clarkson said.

“They’re supporting you being you,” she said of her experience with Atlantic. “Fifteen years later, this is my first time experiencing that!”

Atlantic’s belief in both Clarkson – whose eleven Top 10 hits, three No. 1 singles and trio of chart-topping albums make her one of the industry’s most bankable stars – and the album are obvious. Of 14 tracks on Meaning of Life, Clarkson co-wrote four. The rest bear the sonic stamp of a veritable music industry who’s who.

WATCH: Pollo Del Mar’s Track-By-Track Review of Meaning of Life

Lead single “Love So Soft” alone combines powerhouses Mozella (Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball”), Priscilla Renea (co-writer of Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It”) and Jesse Shatkin (Sia’s “Alive”). Elsewhere are the fingerprints of hip-hop producers The Monarchs (Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber), Grammy nominee Mick Schultz (Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex”) and Greg Kurstin, the Grammy-winning genius behind Adele’s “Hello.”

Saying she previously has “never worked with people who would allow” an album like Meaning of Life, the Texan indicated the reasons stemmed largely from industry decisions on what kind of artist she should be. However, in the interview ― recorded Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day – Clarkson related the story of Nashville-based songwriter Shane McAnally, whose sexual identity altered his path to stardom.

“He’s a phenomenal writer; he’s had like a bajillion No. 1s now,” Clarkson pointed out. “Back in the day, when he was someone’s assistant somewhere, shuffling coffee around, he got, ‘You can’t make it as a country singer if they know you’re gay.’”

In 1999, McAnally signed to Curb Records. After marginal success as a solo artist, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he came out. When he sought to resume his career in country music, though, the stigma of being a gay artist was off-putting to many. “It’s changing now,” Clarkson said, but at the time being out was not acceptable in country music.

“He had to go a different way, and in the end, it’s worked out for him,” said Clarkson of McAnally, who channeled his considerable talents into writing hits for other.

Now Shane McAnally is a multiple-time Grammy and Academy of Country Music Award-winner who has written No. 1 country singles for everyone from Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban to Miranda Lambert and former Hootie & The Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker.

He was named the 2014 ACM Songwriter of the Year and won two Grammys for work on Kacey Musgraves’ breakthrough Same Trailer Different Park. He appears on-track for another blockbuster year as Sam Hunt’s “Body Like a Back Road,” written by McAnally, crossed into the Top 10 at pop radio and is the biggest country single of 2017. He is presently at work on a Broadway musical based on the TV classic “Hee Haw.”

“It’s insane all the stuff he’s accomplishing,” Clarkson gushed about the man who contributed two songs to her chart-topping 2015 album Piece By Piece.

“But what’s sad about that for me – as a friend who’s watching – is he could have sang all that shit himself,” she lamented. “He’s an amazing singer, an amazing performer, but nobody could get past [his being gay].”","Kelly Clarkson Felt 'Suppressed,' Says Top Country Star's Career Changed When He Came Out",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-clarkson-felt-suppressed-says-being-out-changed_us_59fd07f1e4b0d467d4c224f7

Several men from the large group started talking to them, another restaurant patron told HuffPost in a phone interview.
“They immediately started taunting her for being with a black man,” Werme said.
Jerry Grim, manager of the Corner Pub, told HuffPost that his business called the police right away.
“We were afraid someone was going to be thrown through the window,” the unnamed patron’s wife told HuffPost.","WASHINGTON — It was Saturday night, and the Corner Pub in Brentwood, Tennessee, was bustling. Sports fans and families dug into a menu of chili cheese fries and hot chicken chunks. Servers offered Guinness and Caramel Apple bushwackers. Some people were wearing Halloween costumes. Then, sometime before 7:45 p.m., several dozen men and women dressed in black filed into the restaurant and took over a long table.

In an adjoining room of the restaurant, Annelise Werme, a business owner from Murfreesboro, 30 miles away, noticed the group’s attire. The hair on her neck stood up. “Our mayor and police chief advised we needed to prepare as if for a hurricane, hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,” she told HuffPost in a Facebook message. “All of us who own businesses in our historic downtown closed, boarded up.”

Near the large group, a 30-year-old white woman and a 37-year-old black man were sitting at a table. Several men from the large group started talking to them, another restaurant patron told HuffPost in a phone interview. (He declined to be named, citing safety and privacy concerns.) “They were talking about what was good on the menu,” the patron recalled, noting that a guy in the group “wanted anything that was fried.” Then, his wife added, “some words were exchanged. I don’t know what was said, but the black man ... he was visibly upset.”

One member of the black-clad group asked the 30-year-old woman to “guess,” the woman said later, possibly about who they were. “White lives matter,” she responded. “That’s right,” another member said, then he allegedly urged her to join their table and leave her male friend.

“They immediately started taunting her for being with a black man,” Werme said. “Understandably, she was extremely upset.”

The argument escalated even after the woman went outside. The big group got up to leave. “They didn’t place an order or anything, they were looking for a place to cause some trouble,” the first patron said, noting that one person with the group quickly took out a professional camera complete with a shotgun mic.

“We thought it was all over at that point,” his wife said. But about a minute later, they noticed a fight starting outside.

Jerry Grim, manager of the Corner Pub, told HuffPost that his business called the police right away. “I didn’t know who they were. They were just a group of men in black puffy jackets. They had no tags, no markers, nothing on them. It could have been anybody.”

In fact, white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and Klan members, had rallied earlier Saturday in Shelbyville, about an hour away. But they skipped a planned rally in Murfreesboro after being delayed by security in Shelbyville and hearing that nearly 1,000 counter-protesters awaited them. They tried to gather in a nearby park — managing to form a human swastika — but ran when they heard that antifascists might show up, and they had to bail on a planned tiki-torch march. Now a contingent of the white supremacist group had made its way to the restaurant.

“One of our guys was getting his jacket, and words were exchanged,” Matthew Heimbach, a prominent neo-Nazi, told Mic reporter Jack Smith IV. He blamed “the black gentleman” for starting the confrontation. But video from the incident shows a large group of white men brawling and a woman, with blood dripping down her face, pushed against the window of the sports bar.

Inside, some people started to record the fight on their phones, and the environment grew tense as bystanders argued about whether to intervene. “Do you want me to go out there and get beat up? Would that be better?” A man asked.

“Oh, my God ... she’s bleeding,” a man said.

“We were afraid someone was going to be thrown through the window,” the unnamed patron’s wife told HuffPost. “It was terrifying.... We didn’t know if anyone had weapons [or] how far this was going to escalate.”

“Do you speak up? Do you step in and get involved?” her husband said. “It was kind of difficult to judge what was best to do, because it was a quickly escalating situation. My thought was not to go and make it worse.”

By the time police arrived, everyone had dispersed. The 30-year-old woman later came back to make a report. Authorities are looking for the man accused of punching her, described as a white man in his 30s wearing a black jacket and black jeans, according to an Oct. 29 statement from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department that includes the woman’s account of the incident. (The names of the victims have not been publicly released.)

Heimbach said, “The confrontation wasn’t any of us.”

The woman who made the report said she is still shaken. “We as Americans need to open our eyes and come together to stop this injustice and hate,” the victim told Fox 17 in a statement. “I was terrified, and still am.”",A Black Man And A White Woman Sat Down At A Pub.

Mais le match ne se jouera peut-être pas uniquement sur le terrain.

Car le club lyonnais, qui espère empocher un derby qui lui échappe dans le Chaudron depuis novembre 2013, s'est fait remarquer par sa stratégie sur les réseaux sociaux.

Chaque club dispose de sa propre politique en la matière. Certains jouent la carte décalée, en misant sur un registre humoristique et divertissant, à l'instar de Guingamp, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse, pour ne citer qu'eux.

A contrario, la politique de l'OL s'avère bien différente. La tonalité se veut plus sérieuse. Les tweets retranscrivent l'actualité du club (les entraînements, les résultats, les sponsors etc), sans éclat majeur d'ironie. Le contraste est donc saisissant avec les autres entités citées plus haut, d'autant que l'OL n'hésite pas à critiquer parfois ouvertement l'arbitrage ou à chambrer ses adversaires.

Et c'est sans parler du président du club qui a un style bien à lui sur Twitter. Le président Jean-Michel Aulas est sans doute le dirigeant sportif le plus connecté de France. Ses punchlines distillées à tout-va sur son compte Twitter, fort de quelque 431.000 abonnés, lui permettent facilement d'occuper l'espace médiatique.

@Adrien_Ve quand on veut être exemplaire il faut prendre un peu de temps pour vulgariser la gestion et le management du foot à des abrutis — Jean-Michel AULAS (@JM_Aulas) 17 février 2013

Ses messages massivement relayés peuvent être adressés à des anonymes ou à certains supporters de l'OL. Parfois décrié ou alors simplement interrogé, le président lyonnais n'hésite pas à répondre à ses détracteurs pour défendre son club. D'autres messages sont l'occasion pour lui de clamer son amour pour son club de coeur ou de mettre en lumière la progression de son entreprise sportive.

Dans un article publié en septembre sur Yahoo Sports, Charly, fan de l'OL et rédacteur au liberolyon, relevait dans le détail les axes de cette politique jugée ""limite et à l'envers"". Il est vrai que le compte Twitter de l'institution s'est déjà illustré par ""une certaine mauvaise foi"", par exemple lors du match PSG-OL le 17 septembre.

Autre aperçu. Lors de la 3ème journée de Ligue 1 disputée en août dernier, l'OL recevait les Girondins de Bordeaux. Une rencontre âpre, disputée sur le terrain (score final de 3-3) et... sur Twitter. En témoigne le clash assez insolite entre les CM des deux institutions footballistiques.

""Le community manager est désormais devenu la personne la plus importante au sein de l'organigramme administratif d'un club de football! C'est lui qui est en contact direct et permanent avec les fans. C'est lui qui peut mesurer le degré de satisfaction ou de mécontentement des supporters. Les fans recherchent une conversation tout en étant intégrés à une communauté"", expliquait à ecofoot Boris Helleu, maître de Conférences à l'université de Caen.

Une relation quelque peu délicate, sur Twitter, entre certains sympathisants lyonnais et le club rhodanien comme l'expliquait Charly dans son article. Contacté par Le HuffPost, il explique son sentiment: ""Le rôle d'un CM d'une marque très suivie comme l'OL, c'est d'animer, de choyer sa communauté. À Lyon, il manque ce lien entre les deux parties mais je n'incrimine pas spécifiquement le CM de l'OL. J'imagine qu'il obéit aux ordres qu'on lui donne. Parfois, le club en vient même à critiquer certains de ses supporters"". En mars dernier, le club publiait un tweet méprisant, assimilant certaines discussions de fans ""au café du commerce"".

When we see the ""Café du commerce""... 😁😂😝 pic.twitter.com/6Tv3PecbFb — Olympique Lyonnais (@OL) 14 mars 2017

""Quand tu vois le ""Café du commerce""

Vers une nouvelle politique numérique?

Joint par Le HuffPost, l'OL n'a pas accepté de répondre à nos questions au motif que le club est en pleine reconfiguration de sa stratégie digitale. Pour Charly le supporter, il faudrait que le club ""s'approprie davantage ses fans, qu'il leur fasse moins honte, qu'il arrête les trolls (les messages provocateurs, ndlr) malvenus. En somme, si la communication était à la hauteur du club, avec plus de classe et de propreté, ce serait déjà une très bonne avancée.""

Depuis plusieurs semaines, la communication du club sur Twitter s'est toutefois largement assagie. Les sorties ""maladroites"" et autres dérapages sont bien plus rares, comme le confirme Charly: ""Les résultats sont plutôt bons ces derniers temps (l'OL reste sur une bonne série de 5 victoires consécutives toutes compétitions confondues, il occupe la 3e place du classement, ndlr). C'est vrai que ça s'est pas mal calmé sur Twitter. Peut-être que le club a compris la nécessité d'avoir une autre forme de communication et donc d'évoluer sur ce point.""

Für Medizin und Forschung

Christoph Rossner, Manager der “Bunker Pflanzenextrakte”, erklärt, der Bunker biete genügend Schutz, Platz und Energieversorgung für das Vorhaben. Die Marihuana-Pflanzen sollen sowohl der Wissenschaft zugute kommen, als auch für medizinische Zwecke genutzt werden. Der Anbau soll ab März 2018 beginnen.

Tiberian shouldn't even be here. The French horse, who will line up in the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday at the not hopeless odds of 20-1, was an afterthought, the by-product of a bizarre, three-way equine tryst.

Indulge us a moment while we explain the background to this tale of four-legged flirtatiousness.

Horse breeding is complicated stuff. There are many ways to make it happen, from using frozen semen, to au naturel;

When doing things the natural way, expensive stallions with strong bloodlines and/or racing records ""serve"" (as they politely say) a mare. In fact they'll usually serve many mares over the course of a breeding season;

But it's not that simple. Before doing the deed, the mares need a ""teaser pony"". This is the pony (or horse, but it's called a pony anyway), which is tasked with getting the mare in the mood;

We won't go further into the specifics of the foreplay. Use your imagination. But we should clarify that it's dangerous work. You might get bitten or kicked. And that's why you don't want your expensive stallion in there until the mare is good and primed.

Cut to early 2011. In the French countryside about three hours west of Paris, a horse called Tiberius Caesar had been doing his teaser pony duties all season.

Tiberius Caesar had been a poorly performed galloper in his day, winning just one of his 49 races. His bloodline appeared destined to end with him. And why not? Who wanted the progeny of a slow racehorse?

He can run, don't you worry about that.

But Tiberius Caesar found a calling as a teaser. He teased diligently and he teased well. They even had a nickname for him at the Haras du Logis stud. They called him ""Caesar the Teaser"". And eventually, the staff took pity on him.

At the end of the breeding season, Caesar The Teaser was allowed to mate with the mare Toamasina. The result was Tiberian -- who has won six of his 17 races and will be ridden by top French jockey Olivier Peslier in the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday.

NO IDEA ABOUT THE HORSES? JOIN THE CLUB. READ OUR UTTERLY RIDICULOUS MOCK MELBOURNE CUP FORM GUIDE THAT DOESN'T EVEN PRETEND TO TIP YOU A WINNER.

How Tiberian came to be in Australia is an interesting story in itself. As the Herald Sun reported this week, Tiberian was purchased by Australian racehorse syndicator Darren Dance. Last year, Dance bought the French horse Heartbreak City which ran a very close second in the 2016 Melbourne Cup.

Remember the thrilling finish last year? That's Heartbreak City in the fluoro yellow. Just missed!

Tiberian's French owners watched that 2016 Cup. So when Dance courted them, they immediately consented. They kept half-ownership for themselves, et voilà, here we are. The horse that confounds centuries of breeding logic will line up on Tuesday.

In a final delicious twist to this story, there's also a runner in this year's Cup called Hartnell, whose dad was Authorized -- the horse that Tiberian's dad acted as teaser for.

Hartnell ran third in the Melbourne Cup last year, but if this year's odds are any guide, Tiberian the teaser's son is heavily favoured beat Hartnell, the son of the champion.

And isn't equine egalitarianism exactly what our greatest race should be all about?

The agency said it's invested $1 billion to tackle the problem and currently has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations underway related to offshore tax havens.
And last year, it levied more than $44 million in penalties on tax advisers who facilitated non-compliance with Canadian tax laws.

The leak of some 13.4 million records, dubbed the Paradise Papers, lifts another veil on the often murky ways in which the wealthy — including more than 3,000 Canadian individuals and entities — stash their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes.

Among the names that pop up in the records with some connection to offshore accounts are former Canadian prime ministers Brian Mulroney, Paul Martin and Jean Chretien, the Queen, U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and the past and current chief fundraisers for the federal Liberal party.

Neither the CRA nor any court has determined the Canadians did anything wrong.

Former prime minister Brian Mulroney leaves a Liberal cabinet meeting in Ottawa on April 6, 2017.

Offshore accounts are used by wealthy individuals and corporations around the world as a perfectly legal way to reduce their tax burden, although the anonymity provided to account holders has also led to associations with tax evasion, money laundering and organized crime.

The Paradise Papers were obtained by German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including CBC/Radio Canada and the Toronto Star which published details on Sunday.

The media outlets did not disclose how they acquired the documents, which consist primarily of client records of offshore law firm Appleby, as well as some records from offshore corporate services firms Estera and Asiaciti Trust.

CRA says 42 criminal investigations are ongoing

In an apparent attempt to pre-empt the news reports, the CRA issued a statement last Friday, detailing the agency's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and tax avoidance, which intensified following the first huge leak of tax-haven records, known as the Panama Papers, in April 2016.

The agency said it's invested $1 billion to tackle the problem and currently has more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations underway related to offshore tax havens.

As a result of audits over the last two years, the CRA said it identified some $25 billion in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. And last year, it levied more than $44 million in penalties on tax advisers who facilitated non-compliance with Canadian tax laws.

The agency said it's also working closely with 36 other countries in the Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration on more effective ways to detect and deal with tax evasion and avoidance.

A sign is pictured in front of the Canada Revenue Agency national headquarters in Ottawa on March 13, 2017.

Evidently anticipating Sunday's release of the Paradise Papers, the CRA promised to do more should new details of questionable practices emerge.

""In the event that further details come to light, CRA will not hesitate to investigate and take further action as warranted,'' the agency said.

""The government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as other tax administrations and all other partners, to ensure a tax system that works for Canadians. In addition, the CRA will continue to build on its capacity to detect and crack down on tax cheats and ensure that those who choose to break the law face the consequences and are held accountable for their actions.''

A spokesman for National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier, said on Sunday that ""the CRA is reviewing links to Canadian entities and will take appropriate action in regards to the Paradise Papers.''

Tax avoidance measures involving offshore trusts are legal, provided that the trust is genuinely managed offshore and that Canadian taxes are paid on any Canadian contributions.

According to the Toronto Star and CBC/Radio Canada, the records suggest that Stephen Bronfman and his family's Montreal-based investment company, Claridge Inc., were linked to an offshore trust in the Cayman Islands that may have used questionable means to avoid paying millions in taxes.

Bronfman is a close friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tapped him in 2013 to fill the role of revenue chair — effectively, the chief fundraiser — for the federal Liberal party.

Stephen Bronfman attends the Liberal party's caucus retreat in Georgetown, P.E.I. on Aug. 28, 2013.

The offshore trust also involved former chief Liberal fundraiser and senator Leo Kolber and his son, Jonathan Kolber.

William Brock, a lawyer for Bronfman and Jonathan Kolber, denied any impropriety, telling the CBC that his clients ""have always acted properly and ethically, including fully complying with all applicable laws.'' Any suggestion of ""false documentation, fraud, 'disguised' conduct, tax evasion or similar conduct is false,'' Brock added.

The Prime Minister's Office referred questions about Bronfman to the Liberal party.

Party spokesman Braeden Caley said Bronfman's role is strictly a volunteer position devoted to fundraising, ""not policy decisions.'' The revenue chair is a ""non-voting position'' on the party's national board, Caley added.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer issued a statement on Sunday accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of failing to crack down on ""tax avoidance schemes used by his wealthy friends.''

""Justin Trudeau's well-connected Liberal friends get away with paying less, and you pay more. There is nothing fair about that,'' the statement said.

According to Young, the simpler relationship afforded between pet and owner may also benefit those whose mental health issues see them ostracised by others.
Of course, that's not to say everyone with a mental health condition should go out and buy a dog.
We know that social connection with other humans is incredibly good for our mental health, and to some degree [pet ownership] may have similar impacts.
But as I said before, the jury is still out a little bit in terms of how much weight we should give pet ownership as a mechanism to promote mental health.""","That pet ownership can assist an individual's sense of well-being is nothing new. We've known for ages there are many general health benefits associated with owning a pet, such as improved cardiovascular health as a result of increased physical activity.

But what is emerging is the effects of pet ownership on mental health, namely, evidence that those with mental health disorders may find a pet helpful in managing their condition.

""Studies have shown that pet owners are less likely to develop anxiety and depression -- loneliness is a huge risk factor for poor mental health and our pets provide companionship and a sense of purpose,"" Clare Ballingall, spokeswoman for The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told The West Australian earlier this year.

""A study called The Effects of Animals on Human Health and Wellbeing is an often-quoted paper that reviews the evidence that companion animals can improve health and quality of life -- they concluded that the evidence is largely supportive of the view that pets are good for us.""

In terms of exactly how much a difference a pet could make, it obviously depends on the individual. It would be remiss to assume every single person would benefit from a pet. Likewise, it would be remiss to assume every single pet would benefit from an owner.

But for some, owning a pet can be the difference between life and death, and that's no exaggeration.

""In terms of that intersection between human wellbeing and animals, for some people it's very important,"" Dr Janette Young, program director for the Bachelor of Health Sciences at the University of South Australia told HuffPost Australia.

""We are looking at the people who have talked about not taking their own lives because of a pet. This pet has made them feel needed and wanted and loved... it's a very emotive response.

""And if you look at the theories around suicidality, it fits in with the need to be needed. To feel needed is very important.""

According to Young, the simpler relationship afforded between pet and owner may also benefit those whose mental health issues see them ostracised by others.

""It's a really simple thing, but the dog or cat doesn't talk back. It's a simpler relationship,"" she said. ""My theory is, where people are vulnerable, they are quite often stigmatised, and if you are ostracised by people, well, for those individuals a relationship with an animal may be very important.""

Of course, that's not to say everyone with a mental health condition should go out and buy a dog. Not only would that be a 'one size fits all' solution to what is a highly complex and personal problem, but it would no doubt result in some less than ideal situations for the animals themselves. Nobody wants to get to a place whereby animals are viewed merely as a vehicle for human wellness.

But Young argues the relationship between pets and our health should be taken more seriously, particularly in the academic world.

""It is quite polarised at the moment,"" she said. ""You have one group of people who are in the camp of 'oh it's oh so wonderful! Off we go!', and the other who say 'there's not enough evidence [to warrant further study].""

Certainly Dr Stephen Carbone from beyondblue says while initial reports are promising, the evidence is still inconclusive.

""If you pull the results of multiple studies together, I think we can't make any firm conclusions. I don't think it's that black and white. But I will say there is promising or early evidence of the benefits of pet ownership and pets as assistance, adjunct to existing therapy,"" Carbone told HuffPost Australia.

""Pets can provide companionship and friendship. People form very strong attachments to their pets. We know that social connection with other humans is incredibly good for our mental health, and to some degree [pet ownership] may have similar impacts.

""Looking after a pet also gives you a sense of structure or purpose. This might help people who don't have a routine, who don't have other things in their life.

""Particular types of pets, particularly dogs, may also promote more physical activity, and we know physical activity helps.

""There are lots of aspects -- social activity, pride, self esteem, an increased opportunity to meet other people -- they are all likely to be important. But as I said before, the jury is still out a little bit in terms of how much weight we should give pet ownership as a mechanism to promote mental health.""

For Young, it's worth finding out.

""People have a sense of relationship with animals and it's nuanced, it's great,"" she said. ""There's heaps of scope to taking it seriously and pursuing it further.

""I'm not talking about just powering ahead, but progressing with caution. Because for some people the human/animal relationship is really important, and it deserves to be explored.""

Ross' link to Putin appears in the Paradise Papers, a leaked trove of millions of financial documents made public on Sunday by a partnership of media organizations and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Ross, a billionaire industrialist and a close friend of President Donald Trump, continues to hold a stake in a Russian shipping firm controlled by a Russian oligarch, Putin's son-in-law, and other members of Putin's inner circle, according to the documents.

Daniel Fried, an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under President George W. Bush, told The Guardian that Ross' ties to Putin's ""cronies"" could undermine U.S. sanctions on Russia.

In January, ahead of his confirmation, Ross agreed to sell some but not all of his global assets that posed a conflict of interest to his future position. He also agreed, as required by law, to recuse himself from matters in which he would have a direct financial interest.

Ross' spokesman told The Guardian that his stake in the Russian firm would not conflict with his duties as commerce secretary and that Ross ""recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels.""

And my worry is that those in power are too ""preoccupied"" with very important meetings, spar treatments, gala dinners, and of course looting government resources meant for the poor. They are too busy with their commitments to notice the damage being done to us, the young people and the youth of this country.

Government's noisy rhetoric on its initiatives aimed at bettering the lives of the youth is like popular deep house beats with no lyrics. They adopt policies after policies with no clear implementation strategy and no evidence showing whether the so-called initiatives are bearing fruits in the lives of the youth.

South Africa is failing to improve the lives of its youth, leaving them exposed to catastrophic activities such drug abuse, prostitution, criminal activities and absolute poverty. The high unemployment rate is at its highest peak and continues to increase as economic growth fails to improve. Our country is embarrassingly failing to acknowledge the significance of economically empowering the youth, if they cared, they would surely do something to change their actions and direct their energy towards finding lasting solutions to this challenge.

Around 3.3 million of the youth in South Africa are unemployed, although some may be hopeful in breaking the cycle unemployment, others will most definitely not make it. This means that thousands of the youth will resort to extreme harmful measures in efforts to try and make a living, they will go as far as stealing, if not killing for basic material things such as a smart cell-phone. This number will add to the criminals who terrorise our people in our cities, townships and villages.

An article written by Ariana De Lannoy indicated that ""life's chances are determined by the quality of education"", many share the same sentiment including myself. However, in the few past years, this has become quite an opposite as young graduates find it hard to become part of the active economic population of this country. Their uneducated peers tease and make fun of them for remaining in the same standard as them, even after having studied and graduated in colleges and universities. Basically, there is a very thin line between an unemployed graduate and someone who is not a graduate as they are all economically broke and unemployed.

Every parent's wish is to see their children do well academically and for their kids to find proper employment, but when all fails, a feeling of loss and disorientation take its toll and a sense of hope fades. Youths from poor or low-income families are more likely to suffer the most as they deal with the effects of unemployment, anxiety and depression overcome them as they struggle to crack the labour market and have the means to support themselves and their families.

South Africa's economic growth depends on political solutions.

The solution

A Commission of enquiry into unemployment

A commission must be established; the commission must be tasked with a responsibility to determine the unemployment causes, challenges and find solutions to the problems. The commission must provide direction into finding long-lasting solutions to youth unemployment, with the help of policymakers, models must be developed and a monitoring system should be set up to ensure implementation of the policies and models developed. The commission must consist of scholars, economists, traditional, religious and political leaders and youth representatives.

Economic growth

South Africa's economic growth depends on political solutions. Failure by the government led by the ANC to tackle corruption in government and State-Owned Enterprises undoubtedly causes economic decline, political instability and lack of trust in the government by investors. This means that there is very little willingness to address the state of corruption by government officials that continue to plunder resources meant for economic development of the youth and the people of South Africa.

Amendment of the constitution

Social transformation cannot be fully realised without an amendment of the constitution to allow for a true untwisted economic prosperity, equality and justice for all. Particularly on the debate around the expropriation of land without compensation. Such amendments must be made with a clear vision to create a healthy economic environment, build industries and create jobs for the youth.

Local industries

Local manufacturing companies must be built and local products must be promoted. Imported goods that can be locally produced must be reduced to support the local environment. This must be done with a goal to strengthen the local industry and to ensure job creation.

Macroeconomic policies targeting youth employment must not be reduced to mere rhetoric, willingness and action from all parties must be seen and felt by those affected. We all have a responsibility to pursue the question of who is failing the economy and the youth.

We must always be in search of answers to the challenges we face, we must know who presides over our government, departments and all other economic sectors which continuously fail the youth.",Youth Unemployment In SA -- The Curse And The Solution,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/thabo-makwakwa/youth-unemployment-in-sa-the-curse-and-the-solution_a_23261969/?utm_hp_ref=za-homepage

Simply lie on your back with your legs spread open and place a pillow under your hips to prop them up while holding onto your ankles with your hands. Feel free to bend your knees. This will allow easier access to your lower genitals, perineum and bum hole.

How to: Not only is this position sizzling hot in terms of the view for both parties, but it’s great for the “sitter” because s/he can control the amount of pressure, speed and/or penetration depth, O’Reilly says. ""If you like to play with a little dominance and submission, the Sit on My Face position is a sexy way to receive oral sex while maintaining a dominant role."" 1. Have one partner lie on their back and get comfortable with pillows to support the head, neck and knees as needed. 2. Have the other kneel over their head facing up toward the top of their head.

How to: ""Standing up for sex not only varies your body’s interpretations of sexual pleasure, but makes for great opportunities for sex outside of the bedroom,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart while your partner gets on their knees between your legs 2. Don't let those knees buckle!

How to: ""Your bedroom should be a playground for erotic exploration and what playground would be complete without a Swing Set?"" 1. Lie on your back with your legs hanging off the side of the bed. 2. If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.

How to: Some sexual techniques are just better when you approach them from the side. ""If you’re going down on a woman, it may be easier to play with the grooves of her sensitive labia and if you’re going down on a man, a sideways approach can give your tongue easy access to one of the most sensitive parts of his penis: the frenulum,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips. 2. Lie on your stomach at a 90 degree angle and bury your head in their crotch.

How to: If you’re into real estate, then the Reverse Rider has everything you could possibly dream of: a great view, a convenient location with easy-access and top value for your sex play dollar, O’Reilly says. ""The best part about this position is that it maximizes pleasure for both of you to promote dual-orgasms."" 1. One partner lies on their back while the other straddles over their chest facing toward their feet.",대마초 흡연자가 섹스를 더 많이 한다,http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/2017/11/06/story_n_18476740.html?utm_hp_ref=korea#comments

Bush (1989-1993) asegura en un nuevo libro que el actual mandatario, Donald Trump, es ""un fanfarrón"" que actúa guiado por su ego, y confirma que en las elecciones de 2016 votó por la candidata demócrata, Hillary Clinton, y no por el aspirante de su partido.

Su hijo, el también exmandatario George W. Bush (2001-2009), pensó durante la campaña electoral que Trump no sabía ""lo que significaba ser presidente"", según un libro que saldrá a la venta el próximo 14 de noviembre y sobre el que la cadena de televisión CNN y el diario The New York Times adelantaron hoy algunos detalles.

Los comentarios los hicieron ambos expresidentes durante la campaña electoral, en un momento en el que la mayoría de las encuestas daban la victoria a Clinton.

En el libro, llamado ""The Last Republicans"" (""Los últimos republicanos"") y escrito por el historiador Mark Updegrove, el patriarca de los Bush confirma que votó por Clinton, un rumor que había circulado las semanas previas a las elecciones presidenciales.

Bush hijo, por su parte, votó en blanco, algo que ya reveló su oficina el mismo día de las elecciones en noviembre pasado.

Ambos expresidentes compartieron el año pasado con Updegrove lo que opinaban sobre Trump: en mayo de 2016, Bush padre le dijo claramente que no le ""gustaba"" el candidato que su partido había elegido para ocupar la Casa Blanca.

""No sé mucho sobre él, pero sé que es un fanfarrón. Y no me emociona mucho que sea nuestro líder"", afirmó el exmandatario, de 93 años, que añadió después que la razón por la que Trump parecía querer ser presidente era ""un cierto ego"", y que para unir al país era necesario tener ""humildad"".

Bush hijo también siguió con consternación el ascenso de Trump, y cuando este declaró que él mismo era su propio ""asesor"", pensó que el candidato republicano ""no sabe lo que significa ser presidente"".

En un momento de la campaña, el más joven de los presidentes Bush, de 71 años, le dijo a Updegrove que temía ser ""el último presidente republicano"" de Estados Unidos, una cita que inspiró el título del libro.

""En ese momento, creo que estaba preocupado de que Hillary Clinton podría ganar"", explicó Updegrove al New York Times.

""Pero si te fijas en sus valores y en los que compartían su padre y Ronald Reagan (1981-1989), contrastan mucho con los valores del partido republicano hoy, en particular las ideas que promovió Donald Trump en su campaña, que son esencialmente el proteccionismo y una cierta xenofobia"", añadió.

La Casa Blanca reaccionó hoy al libro con críticas a los expresidentes, al argumentar que ""si un candidato presidencial (Trump) es capaz de desmantelar un partido político, eso dice mucho sobre el tipo de legado que tuvieron realmente los últimos dos presidentes"" de esa formación.

""Y eso empieza con la guerra de Irak, uno de los mayores errores de política exterior en la historia estadounidense"" y que ocurrió durante el mandato de Bush hijo, añadió un funcionario de la Casa Blanca, que pidió el anonimato, en declaraciones a la CNN.

Los dos exmandatarios hablan también en el libro sobre su relación, los consejos que se dieron a lo largo de sus respectivos mandatos y la preocupación de Bush padre por el giro a la derecha de dos asesores de su hijo, el exvicepresidente Dick Cheney y el exsecretario de Defensa Donald Rumsfeld.

Στο ναό αυτό πήγαιναν περιστασιακά τα πεθερικά του για προσευχηθούν, όπως έγινε γνωστό από αξιωματούχους.

Η επίθεση αυτή είναι η τελευταία μιας σειράς αιματηρών περιστατικών που συγκλονίζουν τις ΗΠΑ. Πρόκειται επίσης για την πλέον πολύνεκρη επίθεση στο Τέξας.

Ο δράστης, ο 26χρονος Ντέβιν Πάτρικ Κέλεϊ εισήλθε στην εκκλησία των Βαπτιστών στο Σάδερλαντ Σπρινγκς κρατώντας μια ημιαυτόματη καραμπίνα και ντυμένος στα μαύρα, κατόπιν άνοιξε πυρ ενώ βρισκόταν σε εξέλιξη η κυριακάτικη λειτουργία. Τραυμάτισε τουλάχιστον 20 ανθρώπους.

Στην εκκλησία των Βαπτιστών το Σάδερλαντ Σπρινγκς, μια μικρή ξύλινη εκκλησία σαν αυτές που συναντά κανείς διάσπαρτες στις ΗΠΑ, συνήθιζαν να πηγαίνουν οι γονείς της συζύγου ή πρώην συζύγου του δράστη, επισήμαναν οι αρχές, υπονοώντας ένα πιθανό κίνητρο της επίθεσης.

«Γνωρίζουμε ότι τα πρώην πεθερικά του ή πεθερικά του σύχναζαν κατά καιρούς σε αυτήν την εκκλησία. Δεν βρίσκονταν εκεί χθες και δεν γνωρίζουμε γιατί πήγε εκεί τη συγκεκριμένη ημέρα» τόνισε ο σερίφης.

Ο κυβερνήτης του Τέξας Γκρεγκ Άμποτ δήλωσε στο CBS, αφού επισκέφθηκε τον τόπο της τραγωδίας, ότι ο ναός «δεν επελέγη κατά τύχη».

«Είμαι βέβαιος ότι υπάρχει κάποια σχέση με αυτήν την εκκλησία, μια σχέση που θα αποσαφηνιστεί τις επόμενες ημέρες» συμπλήρωσε.

Ο Κέλεϊ αυτοκτόνησε αφού επιχείρησε να διαφύγει από το σημείο του μακελειού, είπε επιπλέον ο σερίφης της κομητείας.

Τον κυνήγησαν δύο άνδρες με το φορτηγάκι τους, κατόπιν το αυτοκίνητό του εξετράπη της πορείας του και ακριβώς εκείνη τη στιγμή ο σερίφης πιστεύει πως εκείνος επέλεξε να βάλει τέλος στη ζωή του με ένα περίστροφο.

«Σημειώθηκε ανταλλαγή πυροβολισμών, πιστεύω, ενώ βρίσκονταν στον δρόμο, κατόπιν συνέβη το ατύχημα. Έφερε τραύμα από σφαίρα, το οποίο προκάλεσε ο ίδιος» εξήγησε ο σερίφης Τζο Τάκιτ στο τηλεοπτικό δίκτυο CBS.

Μεταξύ των νεκρών ήταν η 14χρονη κόρη του πάστορα Φρανκ Πόμεροϊ, ανέφερε η οικογένεια σε τηλεοπτικούς σταθμούς.

«Αντιμετωπίζουμε τη μεγαλύτερη μαζική ένοπλη επίθεση στην ιστορία της πολιτείας μας» είπε ο κυβερνήτης του Τέξας, Γκρεγκ Άμποτ, στη συνέντευξη Τύπου. «Η τραγωδία φυσικά επιδεινώνεται από το γεγονός ότι έλαβε χώρα σε εκκλησία, έναν χώρο λατρείας όπου αθώοι έπεσαν νεκροί από πυρά».

«Δεν πιστεύουμε πως είχε κάποια σύνδεση με αυτή την εκκλησία» είπε στο CNN ο σερίφης Τζο Τάκιτ. «Δεν έχουμε κίνητρο».

This is according to the head of financial education at Old Mutual, John Manyike.

""Save whatever you can,"" he implored South Africans, explaining that tough economic conditions in the country will likely put even more strain to already financially stressed and over-indebted South Africans.

Most South Africans are struggling to save due to income challenges, acknowledged Prem Govender, the South African Savings Institute's CEO, however, for others, the challenge is ""the lack of willpower and commitment,"" she said.

It is the latter group, particularly, that Manyike is encouraging to take saving seriously, ""starting where you can, start with R100.""

READ: Don't Spend Your 13th Cheque Before It Even Arrives

This World Savings Day, here are five types of savings accounts that can help you get started on your saving path:

1. Flexible saving accounts

For example, Standard Bank's PureSave, Nedbank's JustSave, FNB's Simply Save and Absa's Money Builder are examples of savings accounts where you can deposit or withdraw money at any time.

The more you save, the higher the interest rates.

2. Notice day accounts

In this type of account, you cannot get access to your funds until you serve whatever is your notice period as agreed with the financial institution. This may save ""impulsive withdrawers."" The notice periods range from 21, 32 and 61 days.

Normally the longer the notice period, the higher the interest rate.

3. Fixed deposits

You need a minimum investment as per the financial institution and you choose your investment period which could be anything from 33 days to five years. The interest rate is fixed for the period of your investment.

There are also flexible fixed deposits accounts, where withdrawals are limited to two of not more than 15 percent of savings.

5. Tax-free accounts

This type of saving could work for long-term investment.

These accounts were introduced in 2015 as an incentive for South Africans to save. Through tax-free accounts, one can invest up to R30,000 a year and it is capped at R500,000 per one's lifetime.

5. Stokvels

Millions of particularly black South Africans have historically been saving through stokvels to pool their money and get credit when needed. Saving through a group can help you be accountable to a larger collective and there is collective discipline, from which one can benefit.

Stokvels work through the contribution rules set by that group and they may pay you up on your birthday, at the end of the year or at a time you have determined.

Manyike believes anyone can save, only it needs a will and discipline.

He also cautioned consumers to live within their means in the tough economic climate South Africa is in. ""It's important that consumers focus on things we have control over, such as how we control our money on our expenses,"" said Manyike -- and this is how these saving vehicles can help.","'Save whatever you can, start with R100' -- Says Financial Expert This World Savings Day",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/31/save-whatever-you-can-start-with-r100-says-financial-expert-this-world-savings-day_a_23261623/

In the past week, we’ve watched (and rewatched) all of the latest installments which means there’s only one thing left to do. Yup, it’s time to start thinking about what might happen in the third series.

Creators the Duffer Brothers have already confirmed that it’s coming, so here are all the questions that will need answering... Will we see Eleven’s sister again? Episode seven, ‘The Lost Sister’, didn’t quite fit in with the rest of the series. While the writers needed to take Eleven out of Hawkins so that she could return and, ultimately, save everyone in the end, this episode-long shift of focus felt a little clunky. Given how divise the episode has been, we wouldn’t be too shocked if the Duffer Brothers just pretended this whole thing hadn’t happened. But as Eleven’s sister, Kali, remains somewhere out there with her group of bandits and misfits, it has cleared a path for potential future storylines.

Netflix

And what about the other children used by the lab? Eleven is (obviously…) number 11 and Kali was branded ‘008’, so - assuming the scientists worked in numerical order - there are potentially at least nine other children that they experimented on. Are they still alive? And if so, will Eleven use her powers to find them, as she did her ‘sister’? Could Eleven’s mother ever be saved? It was heartbreaking to watch Millie Bobby-Brown’s character discover the truth about what happened to her mum, finding her suffering from mental and physical health issues after receiving electro-shock treatment from the lab, in order to make her forget about her daughter. She remains at her home, which begs the question of whether there’s any way she could be saved? Surely Eleven wouldn’t be able to resist visiting her again… #JusticeForBob?

Yeah, he made a lot Dad jokes, called his car “the Bobmobile” and listened to too much Kenny Rogers, but in the end, we really grew to love Sean Astin’s character. If he’s good enough for Joyce Byers, he’s good enough for us - and let’s not forget that Bob played a pretty pivotal role in figuring out where Chief Hopper was when he got lost in the Upside Down, before then coming to the rescue again when the demodogs took over the lab. Quite frankly, to call him ‘the new Barb’ would probably be an undersell, but just as fans of Nancy’s best pal demanded justice for her after season one, we’re hoping for some sort of event to commemorate for Bob’s untimely demise. At least name the Radio Shack after him. What about the two romance storylines? Lucas Sinclair and Mike Wheeler both had their first kisses, with newbie Max Hargrove and Eleven respectively, during the finale’s Snow Ball dance scene so this will obviously need addressing in future episodes. The Duffer Brothers have confirmed that there’ll be another time skip for the next series though, so it’s unlikely that we’ll get to see the immediate aftermath of the romantic encounters. What’s next for Hopper and Eleven?

Not all of the new relationships in ‘Stranger Things 2’ were romances and the pairing of Hopper and Eleven brought us so much joy, but it was tinged with sadness given that Hopper’s daughter, Sarah, died years ago. Seeing him dote on Eleven and attempt to teach her about the world was heart-breakingly beautiful and when they patched up their differences to close the gate to the Upside Down, we were literally cheering on the sofa. For season three, we’d love to see their bond get even stronger so please guys, no arguing this time. We seriously can’t take it. And Steve and Dustin?

Une pétition lancée par une militante britannique des droits des femmes, Aïcha Ali-Khan, demande à ce que Tariq Ramadan soit suspendu de ses fonctions à l'Université d'Oxford.

La jeune femme l'a annoncé dans un tweet dimanche 5 novembre. Tariq Ramadan est membre associé de la faculté de théologie de l'Université d'Oxford. D'après le site de l'université, il y donne un cours intitulé ""Éthique islamique contemporaine"". Cette chaire serait financée par le Qatar, d'après Marianne.

Pls sign my petition asking @UniofOxford to Suspend TariqRamadan until allegations of sex attacks fully investigated https://t.co/BAQwXenRwm — aisha ali-khan (@aak1880) November 4, 2017

""S'il vous plaît, signez ma pétition demandant à l'université d'Oxford de suspendre Tariq Ramadan jusqu'à ce que les allégations d'agressions sexuelles aient fait l'objet d'une enquête approfondie.""

""J'ai tout de suite cru Henda Ayari""

Aïcha Ali-Khan s'est lancée dans cette pétition parce qu'elle est persuadée de la véracité des faits reprochés à Tariq Ramadan.

Quels sont ces faits? Après le dépôt de plainte par deux femmes en France, pour viol, agression sexuelle, violences et menaces de mort, les témoignages anonymes de plusieurs autres femmes ont émergé. Enfin, une enquête de la Tribune de Genève a recueilli le témoignage de jeunes filles mineures à l'époque des faits, également agressées lorsque Tariq Ramadan enseignait dans les collèges suisses.

Au HuffPost, cette militante féministe musulmane confie: ""Lorsque j'ai appris la plainte déposée par Henda Ayari, j'ai su qu'elle disait la vérité, et ce pour deux raisons. La première c'est qu'une femme musulmane rencontre tellement de difficultés, liées à sa culture familiale et à l'honneur du père qu'il ne faut pas bafouer en rendant publics les agressions sexuelles, que lorsqu'une femme se lance là-dedans, elle ne peut le faire légèrement, surtout quand il s'agit d'une personne célèbre et vénérée. Moi-même, j'ai enduré les pires choses quand j'ai déposé plainte contre le député avec lequel je travaillais à la Chambre des Communes. J'ai vécu cinq années de procédures harassantes.""

""Je connaissais sa réputation""

""Ensuite, j'avais déjà entendu parler de Tariq Ramadan, je connaissais sa réputation, continue la jeune femme, enseignante dans le secondaire. Pour être précise, en 2011, je voulais me rendre à l'une de ses conférences sur le sol britannique. Mon ex-mari policier qui officiait à Londres m'a alors conseillé de ne pas y aller. Selon lui, une plainte avait été déposée contre lui en 2008 pour viol. Mais la plaignante étant repartie dans son pays, l'enquête n'avait pu aboutir. Quand j'ai su pour Henda Ayari, je lui ai tout de suite apporté mon soutien.""

Prête à aider par tous les moyens celle qui a porté plainte, Aïcha Ali-Khan a demandé des comptes à l'Université d'Oxford. ""Je trouve incroyable qu'il puisse continuer à donner ses cours comme si de rien n'était, alors que de graves allégations pèsent contre lui. Certains de nos parlementaires ont dû démissionner pour moins que ça.""

Oxford ne veut pas suspendre Ramadan

Par ailleurs, l'Université d'Oxford ne semble pas pressée de mettre un terme au contrat de Tariq Ramadan. À Libération, l'Université déclarait le 29 octobre n'avoir rien à ajouter à son communiqué laconique du 21 octobre qui disait: ""Nous sommes au courant de ces accusations et les prenons extrêmement au sérieux. A ce stade, nous ne sommes pas en position d'ajouter d'autres commentaires"".

Le 6 novembre, l'Université a toutefois précisé qu'un dispositif avait été mis en place pour accompagner et écouter les étudiants de Tariq Ramadan. Des entretiens individuels ont été organisés avec chacun des étudiants de l'essayiste, relaie Libération. Les étudiants pourront également faire savoir dans quelles conditions ils souhaitent que leurs entretiens avec l'enseignant, d'ordinaire en tête-à-tête, se déroulent au moment de la supervision de leurs thèses.

Alors la militante prend l'Université à partie. ""Je leur ai envoyé un courrier pour leur demander la suspension du poste de Tariq Ramadan, jusqu'à ce que la lumière soit faite sur son cas"". Ils m'ont répondu vendredi 3 novembre, dans une longue lettre que j'ai publiée sur mon blog, qu'ils ne comptaient pas le suspendre, parce que les plaintes n'avaient pas été déposées sur le sol britannique, que les procédures entre les deux pays étaient différentes, et que Tariq Ramadan niait en bloc ces accusations.""

Les médias préfèrent s'intéresser aux députés harceleurs

Selon cette féministe, enseignante du secondaire, Oxford serait plus pragmatique que ce qu'ils laissent entendre. Elle explique au HuffPost que l'université craindrait que Tariq Ramadan ne se retourne contre elle pour suspension ou licenciement abusif, au cas où il serait lavé de tout soupçon.

Cette pétition n'est pas vouée à un grand succès. Lancée dimanche 5 novembre, elle ne comporte pas plus de cinq cents signataires pour le moment. La militante n'en attend pas plus de mille. Et pour cause, les médias britanniques ne se passionnent pas pour l'affaire, mis à part quelques papiers complets dans le Telegraph ou la BBC. Pourtant Tariq Ramadan n'est pas un inconnu de l'autre côté de la Manche.

En 2005, Tony Blair lui confiait un mission, juste après les attentats de Londres, sur la pacification du dialogue entre les religions. Plus récemment, rappelle Libération, sous le conservateur David Cameron, en 2014, il a participé à un groupe de réflexion du ministère des Affaires étrangères sur des questions relatives à la liberté de religion ou de croyance.

Mais les médias lui préfèrent les scandales sexuels qui entourent les députés britanniques. Début novembre, le ministre de la Défense, Michael Fallon démissionne pour avoir flirté trop assidûment avec une journaliste. Le 4 novembre, le ministre écossais Mark Mcdonald rend son tablier également. D'autres politiques sont sur la sellette, d'après le Times, qui a révélé l'existence d'une liste d'une quarantaine de parlementaires conservateurs connus pour des faits de harcèlement. Quinze d'entre eux seraient actuellement ministres.

CANBERRA -- Under growing pressure to conduct a full citizenship audit of federal parliamentarians, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced a new citizenship disclosure process which he stresses is no audit, but compels personal disclosure.

Under the plan, approved by Cabinet on Monday, members of the House and Senate would be forced to provide a statement on personal citizenship circumstances to the Register of Members' Interests, the office that keeps track of politicians financial and pecuniary interests, within 21 days of a passed resolution.

Among the declarations, the member would state they, to the best of their knowledge and belief, was not a citizen of any country other than Australia at the time of nomination for election. The MP would also have to provide proof they had renounced any other citizenship.

There would also be a declaration for the place and date of the birth of the member's parents.

.@TurnbullMalcolm: 'It's very important to stress, this is a personal responsibility for every member and senator.' https://t.co/lNRWHSnL33 pic.twitter.com/cGWkTCxeTp November 6, 2017

""I want to say that this is not an audit,"" Turnbull told reporters in Canberra. ""The obligation is on each member and each senator to make a full disclosure as I have repeatedly said in recent times.""

'It's very important to stress, this is a personal responsibility for every member and senator.

""This is about transparency, it's about integrity.""

Proposed citizenship declaration The House resolves that one, not later than 21 days from the date of the resolution and in subsequent parliaments being sworn in as a member, each member shall provide to the registrar of members interests a statement containing the following columns: a) declaration by the member that at that time the member nominated for election to the House of Representatives he or she was not, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, a citizen of any country other than Australia; b) the declaration that the member, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, is not a citizen of any other country apart from Australia; c) so far as the member is aware, the place and date of the members both and citizenship, which the member held at a time of both; d) so far as the member is aware, the place and date of the birth of the member's parents; e) whether, to the best of the member's knowledgeable, the member has ever been a citizen of another country, and if so, which country or countries; and f) if the member has entered the previous questions in the affirmative, then provide details and evidence of the time and manner in which the member's citizenship of the other country was renounced or otherwise came to an end that.

Resolutions to carry out the declarations have to be passed by both houses and the Prime Minister said the penalty for a false declaration would be contempt of parliament.

The information required by the new system, such as registering the birthplaces of parents, may have raised earlier flags about some of the MPs who have been ruled ineligible by the High Court such as Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash who inherited foreign citizenship from their parents born overseas. Senator Stephen Parry, who last week resigned from the parliament over his dual citizenship, would also have had to register that his father was born in the United Kingdom.

The PM's plan seems similar to a model outlined by opposition leader Bill Shorten last week, calling for ""universal declaration"" of documents to the parliament.

What Malcolm Turnbull is doing surely fits with Bill Shorten's promise last Friday to support for ""universal declaration"". pic.twitter.com/OWMkdZ5kXi — David Crowe (@CroweDM) November 6, 2017

Responding to the PM's plan on Monday, Shorten signalled that he was open to supporting it.

The film, which originally went by the title 'Flammable Children', isn't just a reunion for Elliott and Pearce, with other notable 'Priscilla' alums working behind the camera including Lizzy Gardiner, costume designer who won the Academy Award in 1995.

Usually, contestants introduce themselves one by one stating their names and their body measurements including bust, waist and hip measurements. This year, instead of giving their measurements, the contestants decided to highlight much more important numbers: each woman listed a fact about violence against women in Perú.

Each of the contestants highlighted different subjects including femicide (or killing of women because they’re female) street harassment, and sexual abuse.

Scroll below to see some of the first few statements from pageant contestants.

1. “My name is Camila Canicoba and I represent the department of Lima. My measurements are: 2,202 cases of femicides reported in the last nine years in my country.”

2. “My name is Karen Cueto, and I represent Lima. And my measurements are: 82 femicides and 156 attempts so far this year.”

3. “My name is Juana Acevedo and my measurements are: More than 70 percent of women in our country are victims of street harassment.”

4. “My name is Melody Calderón, and I represent La Libertad. My measurements are: 81 percent of aggressors of girls younger than 5 are close to the family.”

5. “Almendra Marroquin greets you, representative of Cañete. And my measurements are: More than 25 percent of girls and teens are abused in their schools.”

6. “My name is Bélgica Guerra. I represent Chincha. And my measurements are: 65 percent of women who attend university are assaulted by their partners.”

As BuzzFeed pointed out, the women were not alone in their protest. During the swimsuit portion of the competition, the pageant organizers displayed different media headlines of stories about the murder and assault of women in Perú.

“Everyone who does not denounce and everyone who does not do something to stop this is an accomplice,” pageant organizer Jessica Newton told BuzzFeed.

""No es que se aviente uno.","¿Quién fiscalizará el 2018?

El auditor Juan Manuel Portal concluirá su gestión en diciembre próximo, tras ocho años al frente de la ASF. Una situación que ha generado dudas sobre los términos en que la Cámara de Diputados habrá de definir al relevo del auditor, justo en medio de la rebatinga política que provocó la destitución de Santiago Nieto como titular de la Fepade o la caída de Raúl Cervantes como procurador y futuro Fiscal General.

Esto, aunado a la manera en que el Senado ha sido incapaz de definir un Fiscal Anticorrupción desde 2014, lo cual provocó que el Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción que por ley debía entrar en funciones el 19 de julio pasado, iniciara operaciones de manera acéfala.

""Si no hay condiciones para definir a alguien que tenga el perfil idóneo para esa responsabilidad, creo que difícilmente estaremos en condiciones para definir un fiscal, tendremos que esperar a que ocurra la elección de julio del próximo año, para que entonces se decante un poco la efervescencia y busquemos realmente algo distinto"", dijo el presidente Enrique Peña Nieto en octubre pasado, tras reconocer que no existen condiciones para nombrar a un futuro Fiscal General.

Un escenario similar al que se vive en el Senado, donde la alianza PRI-PVEM y la oposición conformada por PAN, PRD y PT-Morena, se han reprochado mutuamente querer imponer un fiscal electoral a modo, previo a los comicios de 2018.

De ahí que la elección de un nuevo auditor resulta vital dentro del ajedrez político del año entrante, pues tal como ha reconocido la Auditoría, alrededor del 66% de los recursos estatales se desvían a campañas electorales.

Ante la nueva crisis que se avecina, los partidos políticos en la Cámara de Diputados consideran la posibilidad de reelegir a Portal en el cargo, ante los resultados arrojados por su gestión al frente de la ASF.

Una posibilidad que el mismo Portal Martínez tiene en mente, al reconocer su intención de ""aventarse"" un segundo periodo como titular de la Auditoría, siempre y cuando la propuesta provenga de los diputados.

""No es que se aviente uno. ¿Sabe qué? O me avientan. Yo no puedo estar buscando, yo termino. Yo tengo un nombramiento, un mandato que termina el 31 de diciembre, así termina, así fue lo que acepté. Si la Cámara de Diputados quiere hacer otra cosa, que me avisen"", indicó.

Ante la insistencia de los reporteros, Portal dejó abierta la posibilidad de un segundo mandato en caso de ser nominado por los diputados.

""La Auditoría Superior de la Federación es, el día de hoy, más sólida, más confiable y más reconocida que hace ocho años. El trabajo desempeñado ha valido la pena"", dijo Portal al entregar el último informe de auditoría de su gestión.

""Tras ocho años de actividades, podemos afirmar que México cuenta con un ente fiscalizador muy distinto al de 2009, cuando inicié mi gestión como Auditor Superior de la Federación. Fue mi propósito hacer un relanzamiento de esta institución, a partir de las bases creadas en el periodo 2002-2009, con el fin de llegar hasta el límite de nuestras atribuciones legales, en aras de impulsar el perfeccionamiento de la gestión gubernamental"", agregó.

""El reto que enfrentamos día a día se mantiene, más allá de quién tenga a su cargo la conducción de esta organización, por lo que espero que el compromiso que se ha manifestado hasta el momento, se profundice e intensifique a través de mantener una actitud profesional, abierta a la autocrítica y que tenga como fin mejorar, de manera continua, su actuación como integrantes de esta gran organización"", agregó.

King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema Wangchuck are on an official trip to India. Right from the airport, where External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj received them, to other official engagements, the star of the moment wasn't the royal couple.

The Crown Prince of Bhutan, Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck, won hearts all around with his cuteness. Born in February, 2016, the little prince was presented with an official football from the FIFA U-17 World Cup and a chess set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

As his smiling parents kept an eye on the pint-sized crown prince, he charmed the PM, bowing prettily and eagerly reaching out for the ball.

And Swaraj wasn't immune to his charm either.

Wine memes disturb me because they glorify wine.","Looking through Facebook today I stumbled upon four wine memes in a row -- gifs with oversized wine glasses, women sobbing comically into wine -- funny and relatable.

One of them said, ""Here's to friends with the same taste in wine, and different tastes in men"", with The Golden Girls clinking enormous glasses of red wine together. My friends that posted or tagged each other in these videos all work in mental health; they're smart, insightful, high-achieving people who I respect and admire.

So, why is this a thing, and why does it seem to be so prolific among clever people? A couple of years ago, publicly sharing a wine meme would have been unusual for anyone who had some kind of investment in looking responsible. Promotion of an alcoholic beverage was reserved for people who wore Jack Daniels beanies and had stubby coolers with vaguely sexist statements on them.

Memes have been a relatively recent phenomenon and their success seems to depend on how relatable they are (such as, the recent one of a child being horrified when someone starts eating their chips) and how edgy they can be (memes about drinking, embarrassing drunken scenarios and Tinder would be examples of this).

Memes seem to be a way of representing or symbolising something that is either too boring or too controversial to put into words -- somewhere between a poem and an emoticon. The wine memes that seem to be the most popular always involve drinking to excess, and some kind of extreme display of emotion -- the ultimate representation of what it's like to drink a lot.

What's behind the wine memes is friendship and connection -- we are signalling to friends and colleagues about a shared experience.

One thing's clear, the culture has shifted, perhaps in a good way, towards not caring as much about what others think and being able to share vaguely inappropriate content. Just like the Jack Daniels beanie signifies a person really, really likes Jack Daniels and wants the world to know it; wine memes and coffee cups with 'wine time' on them help us to craft a certain type of identity.

What is a woman who likes wine like? Perhaps she is busy, overworked, stressed out. Perhaps she needs some 'me time' and wine is the best way to achieve this. You could almost see the proliferation of wine memes as a new way for people to have a voice. But what exactly are we saying?

""I'm exhausted and having a terrible week, but I don't want to share that because nobody really wants to hear it.""

Or: ""I really love wine because it gives me the opportunity to take some time for myself after I've given everything to my family, friends and work.""

Or: ""I love spending time with my friends and getting really silly after a couple of wines, and I want to remind them of how much fun we had.""

The wine memes themselves aren't really the problem. It is obvious from the women tagging other women -- friends, colleagues, family -- that it's a way to connect, a way to say ""I miss you"" or ""let's hang out"" or ""remember when we had that awesome night"". What's behind the wine memes is friendship and connection -- we are signalling to friends and colleagues about a shared experience.

And if it's about that, why let wine take all the credit? Yes, it was there at the time -- and perhaps lowered your inhibitions enough so that you could have deep and meaningful conversations with friends. But so was music, and probably French onion dip, and likely some kind of couch -- and we don't make couch memes. As we know, wine by itself, in bad company, is just wine. It is the people behind the experiences that are a make or break.

Wine memes disturb me because they glorify wine. Wine is just a bunch of off-grapes that cause our brains to release chemicals which turn wine into something that we worship, think about, talk about. Wine has become the focus, not the friendships behind it. Our drinking culture is shifting away from drinking to excess, but one group that is actually increasing its alcohol consumption is women between the ages of 21 and 35.

I wouldn't dream of saying down with wine memes. In fact, I find comically large wine glasses as funny as the next person. My point is that it might be helpful to look a bit deeper when we are sharing memes or participating in them.

Perhaps it is saying something about modern female identity, that we make jokes about the sweet embrace of alcohol, while biding our time until 5pm when it feels okay to pour that wine.

Now, more than ever, women have a voice and a platform, one which is growing larger every day. It might be a good time to examine our relationship with alcohol, and figure out why, when the rest of the country is moving away from it, we are gravitating towards it, with open arms and excessive displays of emotion (and oversized wine glasses).

Perhaps it is just that we care less about what people think, and want to live our lives on our terms. Or, perhaps we are trying to say something very important, and don't quite yet have the words to say it.",Put A Cork In Your Wine Memes,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/briony-leo/why-we-need-to-put-a-cork-in-the-wine-memes_a_23267532/

Aufbegehren der Jungen

Die bayerische Junge Union (JU) hatte sich offen gegen den Parteichef gestellt und forderte den Rückzug Seehofers im kommenden Jahr.

Ein Antrag, in dem mit Blick auf die Landtagswahl im Herbst 2018 ein ""personeller Neuanfang"" gefordert wird, wurde auf der Landesversammlung des CSU-Nachwuchses am Samstag in Erlangen mit deutlicher Mehrheit angenommen.

Bayerns Finanzminister Markus Söder lobte die JU: ""Es gibt immer mal wieder in der Geschichte der Union Landesversammlungen, an denen wird man nicht vorbeigehen können. Die haben eine Wirkung"", sagte der CSU-Politiker am Samstagabend. Söder gilt als aussichtsreicher Kandidat für die Nachfolge von Seehofer.

""Ich weiß, sowas fällt nicht leicht, und das muss man auch in Ruhe machen. Aber ich möchte euch wirklich sagen: Ich habe großen Respekt davor, was ihr für Verantwortung zeigt, welchen Mut ihr habt, was ihr euch traut"", sagte Söder an die bayerische JU gerichtet. ""Das ist eine Landesversammlung, und es ist eine Junge Union, die zeigt Rückgrat in der Partei. Meinen Respekt davor, toll gemacht.""

Un­ter­stüt­zung be­kam See­ho­fer unterdessen von CSU-Par­tei­vi­ze Man­fred Weber: ""Ge­ra­de als bür­ger­li­che Par­tei muss sich die CSU sehr gut über­le­gen, wie wir mit­ein­an­der um­ge­hen. In der Art und Weise, wie es die letz­ten Wo­chen ge­lau­fen ist, wurde be­reits Scha­den ver­ur­sacht. Die Men­schen haben ein fei­nes Ge­spür dafür, dass der An­stand ge­wahrt blei­ben muss.

While acknowledging Buthelezi's role in the violence of the 1980s and 1990s, Holomisa also praised him for calling off the dogs of war.
Holomisa wished him a ""well-deserved rest"".
Buthelezi's role in South Africa's history should never be sanitised.
These are just a few of the places associated with massacres carried out by Buthelezi's party in collaboration with the apartheid state.","Some time ago, I decided to refrain from writing about Mangosuthu Buthelezi until after old age had dealt him the fate that he and his murderous battalions prematurely dealt others. That was mainly because so much has been said and written -- including by this lowly newspaperman -- about the evil legacy of the head of the Inkatha Freedom Party.

Even when he made his long-overdue announcement about his imminent retirement, I was determined to resist the temptation to write about him. But then came the disingenuous tributes. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said Buthelezi had ""run his race and played his role"". DA leader Mmusi Maimane thanked him ""for the role he played in KwaZulu-Natal in the early 1990s"" -- which happens to be when the IFP's bloodlust was at its peak. He expressed appreciation ""for the 1994 decision Buthelezi took to participate in the first democratic South African election after he initially refused"".

Wow!

After the man and his friends in the loony right-wing and the security forces waged a terror campaign against the people with their machine guns, bombs and other weapons, we are supposed to be grateful. But the one that took the cake was a tribute penned by United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa.

While acknowledging Buthelezi's role in the violence of the 1980s and 1990s, Holomisa also praised him for calling off the dogs of war. ""His astute leadership qualities became evident as he helped resolve the situation,"" Holomisa wrote.

Help me here. Someone starts a fire and then gets praised when he joins community efforts to douse the flames? Holomisa continued: ""Shenge was very influential at the negotiating table during Codesa [the Convention for a Democratic SA]. His vision and commitment could not be ignored.""

True.

If only Buthelezi's praise singers could pause and repeat these names: Boipatong, Shobashobane, KwaMakhutha, Sebokeng, Khumalo Street, KwaThema, Meadowlands, Trust Feed, Hammarsdale, Swanieville and Imbali.

He was indeed influential in demanding a semi-autonomous Zulu kingdom and using violence to force his point across. Who could ignore such mayhem and destruction? The general then lectured that Buthelezi's political life ""teaches us that, to be a formidable leader, you never shy away from your responsibility to the nation for empty populist slogans"".

Again, true.

The people of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng know exactly what a formidable leader he is -- not because of empty populist slogans, but because of the time they spent at funerals. In his message, Mantashe wished Buthelezi ""a good retirement"". Maimane wished him ""strength in retirement"" and ""many years of good health"". Holomisa wished him a ""well-deserved rest"".

If only the dead, the orphans, the widows, widowers and the countless victims of Buthelezi's insatiable bloodlust could also have been wished such.

Egregious sins

I know it is human instinct to be nice to the elderly to the point of grossly misrepresenting the truth. This seems to be the case with Buthelezi, who has suddenly become everyone's favourite grandfather figure. Buthelezi's role in South Africa's history should never be sanitised. Of all the Bantustan leaders who collaborated with the apartheid regime, he was the worst.

His fellow travellers, such as Lucas Mangope, Lennox Sebe, Patrick Mphephu and Kaiser Matanzima, were brutal in their collaboration and suppression of anti-apartheid activism. They served the apartheid government with the enthusiasm of a strip-club janitor who loves his job because it gives him benefits he would otherwise not have enjoyed.

But none of them was as dedicated to upholding and defending the apartheid system as Buthelezi. So much so that the National Party government's security apparatus armed and gave logistical support to the killers who proliferated in his party. Elite IFP killer squads and militias were trained by the South African military in camps inside and outside South Africa.

If only Buthelezi's praise singers could pause and repeat these names: Boipatong, Shobashobane, KwaMakhutha, Sebokeng, Khumalo Street, KwaThema, Meadowlands, Trust Feed, Hammarsdale, Swanieville and Imbali. These are just a few of the places associated with massacres carried out by Buthelezi's party in collaboration with the apartheid state.

It is important that, while he lives, Buthelezi is reminded of his egregious sins.

These imbongis should tell those in South Africa's townships and villages who were terrorised by IFP impis that this man truly deserves a peaceful retirement. It is a tribute to the great spirit of South Africans that Buthelezi -- like his surviving masters in the erstwhile National Party leadership -- can enjoy the comfort of the democratic South Africa they fought so hard and bloodily to stop.

We can be certain that this parade of tributes will be repeated when Buthelezi sheds his mortal coil. The revisionism will be strong as people make the excuse that culture says this and tradition says that. We will only be told of his greatness and not the evil that he perpetrated.

So it is important that, while he lives, Buthelezi is reminded of his egregious sins. History behoves us to parade before him the images of the corpses of those who died because he committed troops to the defence of apartheid. As he rocks in his retirement chair in Mahlabathini, he has to be haunted by his deeds.

No rest for this cantankerous chief.

Trump sagte: ""Die Ära der strategischen Geduld"" sei zu Ende

Donald Trump hat seine Position bezüglich Nordkorea bekräftigt. Die Ära strategischer Geduld sei vorbei, sagte der US-Präsident.

""Wenn die Leute sagen, meine Rhetorik sei zu stark, sollten wir uns ansehen, wohin wir mit schwacher Rhetorik in den vergangenen 25 Jahren gekommen sind"", sagte Trump am Montag in Tokio bei einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Japans Premier Shinzo Abe.

Maximaler Druck auf Pjöngjang

Der japanische Regierungschef beteuerte ebenfalls, dass Japan und die USA im Konflikt um Nordkoreas Atom- und Raketenprogramm den Druck auf Pjöngjang erhöhen wollten. Dies sei nicht die Zeit für Dialog mit Nordkorea.

""Dialog um des Dialoges willen mache keinen Sinn"", sagte Abe. ""Wir wollen durch alle möglichen Mittel den Druck auf Nordkorea bis zum Maximalen erhöhen.""

Konkret kündigte Abe an, die Sanktionen auszuweiten: Die Vermögenswerte von 35 nordkoreanischen Gruppierungen und Einzelpersonen sollen eingefroren werden. Mit dieser Strategie wollen die Verbündeten den andauernden Nukleartests des nordkoreanischen Regimes Einhalt gebieten.

Trump verteidigt Rückzug aus Handelsabkommen TPP

Trump verteidigte in Japan auch den Rückzug der USA aus dem transpazifischen Handelsabkommen TPP. Bei einem Treffen mit Geschäftsleuten sagte Trump am Montagmorgen (Ortszeit) in Tokio: ""Wir werden mehr Handel haben als im Rahmen von TPP, und die Situation wird viel weniger komplex sein."" TPP sei nicht die richtige Idee gewesen.

TPP sollte rund um den Pazifik die größte Freihandelszone der Welt schaffen. Der Vertrag war im Februar 2016 unterzeichnet worden, aber noch nicht in Kraft getreten. Die elf Handelspartner repräsentieren 800 Millionen Menschen und 40 Prozent der Weltwirtschaft. Sie wollen nach dem Rückzug der USA großenteils ohne Amerika weiter vorangehen.

""Der Handel mit Japan ist nicht frei und er ist nicht gegenseitig, aber er wird es bald sein"", sagte Trump. Er habe keinen Zweifel, dass dies fair geschehen werde. Es werde eine Zeit dauern, aber dann werde es Handelsdeals und ""Handelskonzepte"" geben.

Entsprechende Gespräche mit Japan dauerten schon sehr lange. Das finanzielle Ergebnis werde besser für beide Länder sein. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten habe Japan in Handelsfragen mit den USA immer gewonnen, sagte Trump.

Ein 23-Jähriger hat einen Rettungseinsatz in Berlin behindert

Er regte sich darüber auf, dass sein Auto eingeparkt war

Bei dem Einsatz ging es um ein einjähriges Kind, das wiederbelebt werden musste

Es ist eine dieser Meldungen, die für empörtes Kopfschütteln sorgen.

Am Freitag hat sich ein 23-Jähriger in Berlin mit Polizei und Rettungskräften angelegt, weil sie sein Auto zugeparkt hatten. Die Sanitäter waren gerade dabei, einen einjährigen Jungen zu reanimieren, der in seiner Kita im Stadtteil Moabit beim Spielen plötzlich ohnmächtig geworden war.

Laut einem Bericht der ""Bild""-Zeitung stellte der Notarzt bei dem Kleinen Kammerflimmern fest und musste ihn an Ort und Stelle wiederbeleben.

""Mir doch egal, wer hier gerade reanimiert wird""

Dass es hier um das Leben eines Kleinkindes ging, scheint dem 23-jährigen Rüpel allerdings herzlich wenig interessiert zu haben. ""Mir doch egal, wer hier gerade reanimiert wird"", soll er laut ""Bild"" zu den Polizeibeamten gesagt haben, die ebenfalls angerückt waren.

Und das, obwohl die Lage völlig offensichtlich gewesen zu sein scheint. ""Ich habe ihm erklärt, dass wir gerade ein Kind reanimieren und den Rettungswagen jetzt nicht wegfahren können"", zitiert die ""Bild"" einen der Sanitäter. ""Doch der hat sich drohend vor mir aufgebaut, als ob er gleich zuschlagen will.""

Feuerwehr erstattet Anzeige gegen den Mann

Außerdem soll der Mann gebrüllt haben: ""Verpisst euch, ich muss zur Arbeit."" Laut der ""Berliner Zeitung"" wurde der Mann zudem handgreiflich und trat den Seitenspiegel des Rettungswagens ab.

Erst als die Polizisten den Mann in Schach hielten, konnten die Sanitäter demnach ihre Arbeit fortsetzen und das Kind reanimieren. Der Einjährige wurde auf die Kinderintensivstation gebracht, gegen den Mann hat die Feuerwehr Anzeige erstattet.

Wie es sich für ordentliche Demonstranten gehört, hatten die Hawaiianer originelle Plakate gebastelt. Ein Video, das die Twitter Userin Kate Ozawa aus ihrem Auto aufnahm, zeigt eine Gruppe von Demonstranten in Honolulu, die den Satz “Wish you weren’t here” – ""Wir wünschten, Sie wären nicht hier"" – bilden, in Anlehnung an den beliebten Postkartenspruch “Wish you were here”.

Ein Spruch fand sich auf vielen der Plakate: “Willkommen in Kenia.""

”Willkommen in Kenia”: Was steckt dahinter?

Der Bundesstaat Hawaii gilt seit Jahren als Hochburg der Demokraten. 62 Prozent der Einwohner stimmten bei der letzten US-Wahl für Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama konnte bei den vorangegangenen Wahlen sogar ein überwältigendes Ergebnis von jeweils 71 Prozent einfahren, nicht zuletzt, weil Obama auf Hawaii geboren wurde.

Es gibt allerdings einige Amerikaner, die das nie glauben wollten – allen voran Donald Trump.

Eine “extrem glaubwürdige Quelle” habe in seinem Büro angerufen und ihm erzählt, dass Barack Obamas Geburtsurkunde gefälscht sei, schrieb Trump 2012 auf Twitter und wurde damit zum Redeführer eine Gruppe von Verschwörungstheoretikern, die glauben, Obama sei in Wirklichkeit in Kenia geboren.

Dann hätte Obama keine Berechtigung gehabt, sich um das Amt des US-Präsidenten zu bewerben, denn die Verfassung sieht vor, dass nur Personen, die in den Vereinigten Staaten geboren wurden, Präsident werden können.

An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012

Anschließend reisten er und seine Frau Melania weiter nach Japan.

Socceroos talisman Tim Cahill will make the trip to San Pedro Sula for Australia's World Cup play-off first-leg match against Honduras.

There were concerns the 37-year-old would miss the Honduras leg of the tie due to an ankle injury picked up while playing for Melbourne City on Friday night, but Football Federation Australia (FFA) announced on Sunday morning he would leave a day later than the rest of the squad.

The rest of the players will leave today.

The FFA said Cahill had been cleared of a fracture on Saturday, but would require continued assessment and treatment before any decision would be made about his availability for the match in San Pedro Sula.

""Cahill's delayed departure to Honduras is part of the monitoring and rehabilitation process that has been put in place for an ankle injury that the Melbourne City FC attacker sustained on Friday night while playing in the Hyundai A-League,"" the FFA said in a statement.

Cahill was forced off in the first half at AAMI Park after landing awkwardly when attempting to hurdle Sydney FC defender Jordi Buijs and was whisked away to hospital for scans.

The FFA also confirmed forward Robbie Kruse would not travel to Honduras due to injury, but would join the squad in Sydney along with Mathew Leckie and Mark Milligan, who are suspended for the first leg.

The home-and-away tie with concludes in Sydney on November 15.

FUSILLADE AU TEXAS - San Bernardino, Las Vegas, Aurora, Sandy Hook... Les récentes tueries de masse aux États-Unis ont toutes été associées à deux lettres et un nombre: AR-15. Le nom de ce fusil d'assaut est de nouveau cité dans les colonnes des journaux américains ce lundi 6 novembre, au lendemain d'une fusillade dans une église de Sutherland Springs, au Texas, ayant fait au moins 26 morts.

Les autorités américaines ont indiqué que le tireur, retrouvé mort dans sa voiture et dont les motivations ne sont pas encore connues, avait utilisé un fusil de type AR-15 de la marque Ruger, rapporte le New York Times. Il a pu lui coûter entre 500 et 900 dollars, selon le modèle. Des dizaines de fabricants d'armes aux États-Unis produisent leur propre modèle.

L'AR-15 a cessé d'être fabriqué et commercialisé pour des usages privés de 1994 à 2004, dans le cadre d'une interdiction des armes d'assaut votée par le Congrès américain. Ce ""federal assault weapons ban"" n'a pas été renouvelé, faute de consensus politique et du fait du lobbying des partisans des armes à feu. Depuis 2004, la vente (parfaitement légale, donc) de l'AR-15 a décollé aux États-Unis, selon le New York Times. Les ventes rebondissent aussi automatiquement après chaque tuerie de masse.

""L'arme préférée des Américains""

Cette arme a depuis été utilisée à l'école primaire de Sandy Hook et dans une salle de cinéma d'Aurora en 2012, à l'Umpqua Community College de Roseburg dans l'Oregon et à San Bernardino en 2015, et début octobre lors de la fusillade de Las Vegas.

Deux jours après la tuerie dans une boîte de nuit LGBT d'Orlando en 2016, nos confrères du HuffPost américain étaient parvenus à acheter un AR-15 en seulement 38 minutes, avec une pièce d'identité et sans avoir besoin de permis de port d'armes. Le tireur Omar Mateen avait utilisé une arme aux caractéristiques similaires pour tuer 49 personnes. ""En quelques secondes, nous le tenions dans nos mains: un fusil qui pèse moins qu'une petite pastèque et peut tirer plusieurs dizaines de balles en moins de dix secondes"", écrivaient nos confrères.

""Ce ne sont pas les moins chers (une autre carabine de plus gros calibre, accrochée au mur du magasin, coûtait deux fois moins) mais l'association américaine des armes à feu, la puissante NRA, juge que l'AR-15 est l'arme préférée des Américains"", explique encore le HuffPost américain.

""Elle est personnalisable, modulable, fiable et précise, indique l'organisation sur son site. La possibilité de modifier l'AR-15 selon vos goûts personnels est l'une des choses qui le rendent si unique."" Et la NRA de partager des images de fusils de type AR-15 customisés grâce à ""tellement, TELLEMENT, TEEEEEELLEMENT d'accessoires"". Comme ce fusil, ""recouvert de toutes sortes de couleurs et de motifs"":

""Une arme de guerre""

L'AR-15 est en fait une variante civile du M16, le fusil utilisé dans l'armée américaine depuis près d'un demi-siècle -et bien connu des amateurs de jeux vidéo de tir ou de guerre. C'est un fusil semi-automatique, ce qui signifie qu'une seule munition est tirée à chaque appui sur la détente, mais que les cartouches se chargent automatiquement pour tirer le coup suivant.

""C'est un sujet morbide, mais ces gens-là vont choisir l'arme qui leur permette de tirer le plus possible, une carabine semi-automatique qui ait de la précision, qui soit stable, qui ait un grand chargeur"", analyse le lieutenant colonel à la retraite Scott Mann, interrogé par le San Bernardino Sun. ""Un fusil d'assaut ou un semi-automatique est typiquement ce qu'ils vont choisir, parce que ces gens-là veulent tuer beaucoup de monde"", explique-t-il.

En octobre, un professeur de médecine d'Harvard résumait la puissance de l'AR-15: ""Pour le dire clairement, les armes semi-automatiques peuvent faire des dégâts monstrueux sur un très grand nombre de personnes en très peu de temps, même lorsqu'elles sont maniées par des personnes dérangées sans compétence de tir"", expliquait Adam Gaffney au Washington Post.

Des familles de victimes de la tuerie de Sandy Hook, à Newtown (Connecticut), ont attaqué en justice les fabricants de l'AR-15, jugeant qu'il était ""une arme de guerre"" qui ne devrait en aucun cas pouvoir se retrouver entre les mains de civils. Leur avocat, Joshua D. Koskoff, estimait de son côté que la puissance de l'AR-15 ne séduisait pas les chasseurs ou les passionnés de tir: ""Il n'y a qu'une activité dans laquelle l'AR-15 règne en maître: les tueries de masse.""

""Il n'est pas plus une arme de poing que le tank n'est une voiture"", jugeait-il encore. La plainte des familles de victimes a été classée sans suite, jugée trop ""vaste"" pour être étudiée par la justice.

One partner lies on their back with their knees bent and feet flat on the mattress. 2. The other partner lies atop also on their back with their crotch in the bottom partner’s face. Top partner can lean back against the lower partner’s bent legs/thighs.

How to: ""Though some people swear by it, many of my clients complain that the traditional 69 position can be frustrating and uncomfortable,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Switch it up a little by lying on your sides facing one another so you can give and receive pleasure simultaneously without having to support one another’s body weight.

How to: 1. One partner lies on their side with their top leg bent. 2. The other partner lies on their side facing into their partner’s crotch with a pillow to prop up their head. 3. The first partner lifts their bent leg over the lower partner to give them easier access.

How to: ""Just because this position is pretty self-explanatory, it doesn’t mean it’s a bore,"" O’Reilly says. The Dog allows your partner to access your hot, pulsing nether-regions from both the front and back, and makes it easy for you to control the pressure and depth. 1. Get down on all fours (hands and knees). 2. Your partner can approach from behind or lie beneath you on their back.

How to: Are you more of a taker or a giver? ""As a lover, it is imperative to know how to play both roles and the Gimme More position encourages you to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Sit on your bum with your back resting against the wall or headboard. 2. Bend your knees and spread your legs open with your feet flat against the floor or mattress. 3. Enjoy the view or ask for a blindfold to heighten your touch, smell and sound sensations.

How to: Giving directions is about more than just spewing orders. ""You can easily communicate your wants, needs and fantasies using your body language alone."" 1. Sit upright in a chair with you legs spread apart. 2. Place a pillow at your feet and guide your kneeling partner's hands and mouth toward your sweet spots.

How to: Feeling lazy, but still want to get it on? Then this is the position for you. ""It not only combines the excitement of a rear-entry approach, but allows you to experience new sensations and play with the vulnerability of being pleasured from behind,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Lie on your stomach with your hips propped up by a pillow. 2. If you’re a screamer and want to stay on good terms with your nosy (and jealous) neighbours, you may also want to put your face in a pillow to muffle some of your more explicit sounds.

How to: ""This position forces you to take a more passive role,"" O’Reilly says. However, you can always get active with some sultry dirty talk while you’re lying there. 1. Lie on your back and spread your legs. Seriously. That’s it!

How to: This position is a slight variation of the Lie Back and Take It. 1. Simply lie on your back with your legs spread open and place a pillow under your hips to prop them up while holding onto your ankles with your hands. Feel free to bend your knees. This will allow easier access to your lower genitals, perineum and bum hole.

How to: Not only is this position sizzling hot in terms of the view for both parties, but it’s great for the “sitter” because s/he can control the amount of pressure, speed and/or penetration depth, O’Reilly says. ""If you like to play with a little dominance and submission, the Sit on My Face position is a sexy way to receive oral sex while maintaining a dominant role."" 1. Have one partner lie on their back and get comfortable with pillows to support the head, neck and knees as needed. 2. Have the other kneel over their head facing up toward the top of their head.

How to: ""Standing up for sex not only varies your body’s interpretations of sexual pleasure, but makes for great opportunities for sex outside of the bedroom,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart while your partner gets on their knees between your legs 2. Don't let those knees buckle!

How to: ""Your bedroom should be a playground for erotic exploration and what playground would be complete without a Swing Set?"" 1. Lie on your back with your legs hanging off the side of the bed. 2. If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.

How to: Some sexual techniques are just better when you approach them from the side. ""If you’re going down on a woman, it may be easier to play with the grooves of her sensitive labia and if you’re going down on a man, a sideways approach can give your tongue easy access to one of the most sensitive parts of his penis: the frenulum,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips. 2. Lie on your stomach at a 90 degree angle and bury your head in their crotch.

How to: If you’re into real estate, then the Reverse Rider has everything you could possibly dream of: a great view, a convenient location with easy-access and top value for your sex play dollar, O’Reilly says.

Der Fall eines herzlosen Autofahrers in Berlin sorgt für Empörung

Der 23-Jährige hatte Sanitäter attackiert, während sie ein einjähriges Baby reanimierten

Nun hat sich der Vater des Jungen zu dem Vorfall geäußert

Nach dem Aufsehen erregenden Rettungseinsatz für seinen einjährigen Sohn in Berlin hat sich nun der Vater des Kindes zu Wort gemeldet.

Das Kind war am Freitagmorgen in seiner Kita im Stadtteil Moabit beim Frühstück plötzlich ohnmächtig geworden, die herbeigerufenen Sanitäter stellten Kammerflimmern fest und mussten den Kleinen an Ort und Stelle wiederbeleben.

Ein 23-jähriger Mann, dessen Auto von den Rettungsfahrzeugen zugeparkt war, hatte die Sanitäter währenddessen attackiert und beschimpft. ""Mir doch egal, wer hier reanimiert wird""”, soll er gesagt haben. ""Verpisst euch, ich muss zur Arbeit.""

Der 23-Jährige ging die Sanitäter nicht nur verbal an, sondern wurde auch handgreiflich. Er demolierte den Rettungswagen und trat einen Seitenspiegel ab. Erst, als die Polizei zu Hilfe kam und den Mann in Schach hielt, konnten die Sanitäter ihre Arbeit fortsetzen und den kleinen Jungen ins Krankenhaus bringen.

Nach Angaben der ""Bild"" liegt der Einjährige derzeit im künstlichen Koma und soll am Montag aufgeweckt werden.

Prince Jigme is currently the royal couple’s only son and the heir to the throne. The position of king is currently held by his father, and has been since his grandfather, Jigme Singye Wangchuck abdicated the throne in 2006 for his son to take over responsibility in 2008, says the BBC.

Bhutan became a democratic, constitutional monarchy in 2008. Like the government in the United Kingdom, Bhutan’s king serves as the head of state, while a prime minister oversees the government. The role of the king, then, and eventually Prince Jigme, is and will be “primarily representative, serving to symbolize the unity and integrity of the state at home and abroad,” according to Britannica.

King Jigme is widely respected and beloved in Bhutan, and oversaw the country’s final stages toward a full democracy in 2008. “He travelled extensively around the country encouraging people to take part in the vote ― in which both main parties competed for power on similar manifestos, utterly loyal to their king,” BBC reported at the time. The king and his wife have hosted Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge when they made a trip to the region in April 2016.

The royal family’s most recent trip, a four-day tour of India that began Tuesday, was thought to be a significant step toward moving forward together after a conflict between India and China over territory in the Doklam peninsula.

“In the aftermath of the Doklam standoff, the king’s visit could help an exchange of views on the matter at the highest levels in India and Bhutan,” Harsh V. Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College in London told Indian website LiveMint.

Mihai Maxim via Getty Images

FISCALITÉ - Dix-huit mois après les ""Panama Papers"" portant sur la fraude fiscale, le Consortium international des journalistes d'investigation (ICIJ), regroupant 96 médias de 67 pays, a commencé à dévoiler les ""Paradise Papers"".

A l'appui de ces révélations, la fuite de 13,5 millions de documents financiers, provenant notamment d'un cabinet international d'avocats basé aux Bermudes, Appleby, obtenus par le journal allemand Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Des documents provenant d'Appleby dévoilent notamment que le ministre américain au Commerce Wilbur Ross a gardé des participations dans une société de transport maritime ayant des liens d'affaires étroits avec un oligarque russe visé par des sanctions américaines et avec un gendre de Vladimir Poutine, selon le New York Times.

Mais là où les Panama Papers mettaient au grand jour de nombreux cas de fraudes et d'évasions fiscales (même si détenir un compte dans des paradis fiscaux n'est pas illégal, à condition de le déclarer), les Paradise Papers font surtout état de savants montages d'optimisations fiscales. Moralement répréhensible, sans doute, mais pas illégal.

La France s'est battue pour que les paradis fiscaux, le secret bancaire, la fraude organisée, ça soit terminé Nicolas Sarkozy, 23/09/09

Dix ans après le début de la crise financière qui a ébranlé la finance mondiale, on peut être surpris par la permanence de ces pratiques, surtout quand on a encore en tête les déclarations de Nicolas Sarkozy. ""A Londres, la France s'est battue pour que les paradis fiscaux, le secret bancaire, la fraude organisée, ça soit terminé"", avait-il déclaré sur TF1 le 23 septembre 2009.

En effet, en plus de jeter une lumière crue sur les pratiques de la finance internationale, la crise des subprimes a aussi plongé de nombreux pays dans la récession, tarissant les recettes fiscales tout en faisant grimper les dépenses sociales, avec à la clé une explosion des déficits. D'où l'intérêt de mettre fin à des pratiques tolérées depuis des décennies, mais coûteuses pour le Trésor public.

Plus facile à dire qu'à faire, n'en déplaise à Nicolas Sarkozy... Harmoniser la fiscalité internationale, cela prend du temps, beaucoup de temps. ""On est à la fois sur du droit international et des conventions fiscales. Il faut modifier des règles très complexes sur la base d'un consensus"", résume l'économiste Philippe Crevel, du Cercle de l'Epargne.

Or, vu le nombre de paradis fiscaux, c'est loin d'être simple. Un paradis fiscal est un pays, ou une juridiction, qui pratique un taux d'imposition sur les sociétés, les revenus, ou le patrimoine, très bas, et privilégie l'opacité bancaire.

""L'UE est la zone avec la densité de paradis fiscaux la plus forte"", déplore au HuffPost François d'Aubert, expert du sujet, président de la Commission d'évaluation du forum mondial sur la fiscalité de l'OCDE de 2009 à 2015.

Gibraltar, les îles de Man, Gersey, Guernesey, mais aussi Chypre, Malte, Monaco, et des pays comme les Pays-bas, le Luxembourg, l'Autriche, la Suisse, sont rangés dans la catégorie ""paradis fiscal"" par l'OCDE.

Big bang fiscal en vue pour 2018

Malgré tout, la cause avance. Impensable il y a encore quelques années, la Suisse a voté la fin du secret bancaire pour les ressortissants étrangers en 2015. Il entrera en application en 2018, comme dans de nombreux autres pays.

L'histoire pourrait même rendre justice aux déclarations de Nicolas Sarkozy. En effet, suite au fameux G20 à Londres en 2009, un big bang fiscal va s'opérer en 2018: une centaine de pays se sont engagés à communiquer automatiquement des données sur les comptes de résidents étrangers.

""Une banque à Singapour sera tenue d'envoyer au fisc français les relevés de compte de ses ressortissants, se félicite François d'Aubert. C'est un système très serré qui va donner une grande connaissance des circuits financiers"". Et ceux qui ne sont pas en règle peuvent déjà s'attendre à un contrôle fiscal...

Bien sûr, il reste encore beaucoup à faire, comme le montre la question de l'imposition des ""GAFA"" ""Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) en Europe. Trouver le consensus n'est pas gagné d'avance pour harmoniser la fiscalité des états membres.

Quand Apple a été condamné par la justice européenne à rembourser 13 milliards d'euros d'impôts à l'Irlande en 2016, l'Irlande a fini poursuivie en octobre pour laxisme par la justice européenne: le pays ne veut pas recouvrir cette somme, fidèle à sa politique fiscale.

""Il faut imposer les bénéfices là où ils sont réalisés, reconnaît François d'Aubert. Le sujet avance bien à Bruxelles, mais le combat est dur, à la fois sur la fiscalité et la concurrence"". Une résistance à la hauteur d'enjeux qui se comptent en milliards d'euros.

Sie wollen die Rückzahlung des Kaufpreises gegen die Rückgabe der VW-Autos

Wieso das keine Sammelklage ist

Der Dieselskandal geht in die nächste Runde: Mehr als 15.000 Besitzer manipulierter Dieselwagen haben am Montag über die Internetplattform ""myright.de"" eine Schadenersatzklage gegen Volkswagen eingereicht. Dafür fuhren etwa 50 Betroffene gemeinsam in einem Bus am Landgericht Braunschweig vor.

Nach Angaben des Rechtsdienstleisters ""myright.de"" beläuft sich die Schadensumme auf mehr als 350 Millionen Euro. Für die genau 15.374 Geschädigten verlange man die Rückzahlung des Kaufpreises gegen die Rückgabe der Fahrzeuge.

""Deutsche Kunden sind nicht Kunden zweiter Klasse. Sie haben dieselben Rechte und Ansprüche wie US-Kunden"", sagte Christopher Rother von der US-Kanzlei Hausfeld. Das sei die Botschaft an Volkswagen, den Bund und das Land Niedersachsen. In den USA hat VW - im Gegensatz zu Europa - Milliarden ausgegeben, auch um Klagen privater Kunden in einem Vergleich abzuräumen.

Das passiert nun bei Gericht

Trotz der umfangreichen Klage werde es am Landgericht den gewohnten Ablauf geben, betonte eine Sprecherin in Braunschweig. Die eingegangenen Unterlagen würden nun geprüft und einem zuständigen Richter übermittelt, der über den weiteren Ablauf entscheide.

""Wir haben seit Anfang des Jahres zwei Spezialkammern eingerichtet, die auf entsprechende Verfahren eingerichtet sind"", hieß es.

Die Allianz bietet zu dieser Gelegenheit Neukunden einen einmaligen Willkommens-Rabatt in Höhe von 50 Euro an. → Was eure Kfz-Versicherung kostet, könnt ihr bei der Allianz innerhalb weniger Minuten berechnen → Jetzt kostenlos und unverbindlich direkt bei der Allianz beraten lassen: 0800 7243951 (kostenlos)

Das ist keine echte Sammelklage wie in den USA

Die Strategie, einzelne Ansprüche privater Kunden zu bündeln, um ihnen so in der Summe mehr Schlagkraft zu verleihen, orientiert sich an den Musterverfahren im Kapitalmarktrecht.

Echte ""Sammelklagen"" wie etwa in den USA gibt es in Deutschland jedoch nicht. Forderungen, dies auch hier einzuführen, tauchten auch im Bundestagswahlkampf auf.

Der Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentrale (vzbv) sieht das Braunschweiger Verfahren grundsätzlich positiv. ""Vom VW-Skandal betroffene Kunden verdienen eine Entschädigung und Wiedergutmachung des Schadens. Wenn sie dabei von Anwaltskanzleien unterstützt werden, ist das legitim"", meinte vzbv-Chef Klaus Müller.

Welche Nachteile es für die VW-Kläger geben könnte

Man dürfe dabei aber nicht vergessen, dass es auch mögliche Nachteile gebe: ""Abtretungsmodelle, wie das der Kanzlei Hausfeld, sind nicht der optimale Weg für eine Entschädigung der betroffenen Verbraucher. Denn sie bieten nur für Massenschadensfälle Lösungen, die für Kanzleien auch eine entsprechende Rendite erwarten lassen. Hohe Provisionen im Falle einer erfolgreichen Klage führen dazu, dass Verbraucher nicht den vollen Umfang ihres Schadens ersetzt bekommen."" Daher müsse die Musterfeststellungsklage endlich eingeführt werden.

Nach Angaben eines VW-Sprechers wurde bislang in gut 900 zivilrechtlichen Fällen entschieden - und in 70 bis 75 Prozent dieser Fälle hätten die Richter die Klage abgewiesen. Insgesamt seien gut 7000 zivilrechtliche Verfahren anhängig.

If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.
Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips.","How to: This one is best performed on a vulva because the penis doesn’t generally bend to accommodate this type of arrangement, says sexologist and author Jessica O’Reilly of Hot Sex Tips, Tricks, And Licks. 1. One partner lies on their back with their knees bent and feet flat on the mattress. 2. The other partner lies atop also on their back with their crotch in the bottom partner’s face. Top partner can lean back against the lower partner’s bent legs/thighs.

How to: ""Though some people swear by it, many of my clients complain that the traditional 69 position can be frustrating and uncomfortable,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Switch it up a little by lying on your sides facing one another so you can give and receive pleasure simultaneously without having to support one another’s body weight.

How to: 1. One partner lies on their side with their top leg bent. 2. The other partner lies on their side facing into their partner’s crotch with a pillow to prop up their head. 3. The first partner lifts their bent leg over the lower partner to give them easier access.

How to: ""Just because this position is pretty self-explanatory, it doesn’t mean it’s a bore,"" O’Reilly says. The Dog allows your partner to access your hot, pulsing nether-regions from both the front and back, and makes it easy for you to control the pressure and depth. 1. Get down on all fours (hands and knees). 2. Your partner can approach from behind or lie beneath you on their back.

How to: Are you more of a taker or a giver? ""As a lover, it is imperative to know how to play both roles and the Gimme More position encourages you to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Sit on your bum with your back resting against the wall or headboard. 2. Bend your knees and spread your legs open with your feet flat against the floor or mattress. 3. Enjoy the view or ask for a blindfold to heighten your touch, smell and sound sensations.

How to: Giving directions is about more than just spewing orders. ""You can easily communicate your wants, needs and fantasies using your body language alone."" 1. Sit upright in a chair with you legs spread apart. 2. Place a pillow at your feet and guide your kneeling partner's hands and mouth toward your sweet spots.

How to: Feeling lazy, but still want to get it on? Then this is the position for you. ""It not only combines the excitement of a rear-entry approach, but allows you to experience new sensations and play with the vulnerability of being pleasured from behind,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Lie on your stomach with your hips propped up by a pillow. 2. If you’re a screamer and want to stay on good terms with your nosy (and jealous) neighbours, you may also want to put your face in a pillow to muffle some of your more explicit sounds.

How to: ""This position forces you to take a more passive role,"" O’Reilly says. However, you can always get active with some sultry dirty talk while you’re lying there. 1. Lie on your back and spread your legs. Seriously. That’s it!

How to: This position is a slight variation of the Lie Back and Take It. 1. Simply lie on your back with your legs spread open and place a pillow under your hips to prop them up while holding onto your ankles with your hands. Feel free to bend your knees. This will allow easier access to your lower genitals, perineum and bum hole.

How to: Not only is this position sizzling hot in terms of the view for both parties, but it’s great for the “sitter” because s/he can control the amount of pressure, speed and/or penetration depth, O’Reilly says. ""If you like to play with a little dominance and submission, the Sit on My Face position is a sexy way to receive oral sex while maintaining a dominant role."" 1. Have one partner lie on their back and get comfortable with pillows to support the head, neck and knees as needed. 2. Have the other kneel over their head facing up toward the top of their head.

How to: ""Standing up for sex not only varies your body’s interpretations of sexual pleasure, but makes for great opportunities for sex outside of the bedroom,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart while your partner gets on their knees between your legs 2. Don't let those knees buckle!

How to: ""Your bedroom should be a playground for erotic exploration and what playground would be complete without a Swing Set?"" 1. Lie on your back with your legs hanging off the side of the bed. 2. If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.

How to: Some sexual techniques are just better when you approach them from the side. ""If you’re going down on a woman, it may be easier to play with the grooves of her sensitive labia and if you’re going down on a man, a sideways approach can give your tongue easy access to one of the most sensitive parts of his penis: the frenulum,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips. 2. Lie on your stomach at a 90 degree angle and bury your head in their crotch.

How to: If you’re into real estate, then the Reverse Rider has everything you could possibly dream of: a great view, a convenient location with easy-access and top value for your sex play dollar, O’Reilly says. ""The best part about this position is that it maximizes pleasure for both of you to promote dual-orgasms."" 1.

Réalisée par l'association Animal Testing, elle a été relayée par Libération ce lundi 6 novembre. L'association s'était déjà fait connaître pour avoir révélé des expériences sur les chiens financées par le Téléthon, ainsi que les conditions de vies de singes enfermés dans le sous-sol d'un hôpital parisien.

Face caméra, le visage et la voix brouillés pour garantir son anonymat, une technicienne de laboratoire témoigne de la dureté de ces conditions de travail face à la souffrance infligée aux animaux, images à l'appui. La vidéo peut être visionnée sur Youtube, attention, certaines images peuvent heurter la sensibilité.

""Un chercheur m'a demandé de prélever du sang sur plusieurs dizaines de souris"", raconte-t-elle, ""autant de sang qu'il était possible sur chaque animal, sans anesthésie, en les prélevant au niveau de l'œil"". Pour elle, c'était la demande de trop, qui l'a poussée à contacter l'association. ""On ne peut pas prélever du sang sur un être vivant jusqu'à temps qu'il n'y ait plus de sang, comme si c'était un flacon, et qu'il meure de ce qu'on lui fait subir.""

D'après cette technicienne, interrogée par Libération, le laboratoire parisien accueille simultanément plusieurs milliers de souris, modifiées génétiquement dans la plupart des cas et rendues malades. Certaines ont des tumeurs tellement grosse qu'un chercheur s'amuse: ""c'est comme si elles se baladaient avec un sac à dos"".

""Ce n'est pas évident les dislocations vertébrales""

En théorie, les animaliers de laboratoires doivent ""apporter un bien-être aux animaux de laboratoire et assurer la prise en charge technique des expérimentations"", résume la fiche Onisep de la profession. La lanceuse d'alerte, elle, s'occupe de changer leurs litières, de les sevrer, de prélever leur sang, organes, tumeurs, leurs injecter des produits ou des cellules cancéreuses. Et de les tuer.

Une technique courante, indique-t-elle dans la vidéo, est la dislocation verticale, que l'on voit réalisée par une autre salariée. Elle consiste à tirer brusquement sur la queue et la tête de l'animal, et qui ne marche pas toujours du premier coup. ""Ça j'en ai fait, je dirais, des centaines de fois"", témoigne la lanceuse d'alerte.

D'autres souris sont intoxiquées au CO2, d'abord endormies dans un caisson puis mises à mort. Une autre animalière commente: ""Quand j'en ai le temps, je fais comme ça, parce que ce n'est pas évident les dislocations vertébrales"". Dans les images filmées, une souris continue de se débattre dans ce caisson alors que toutes les autres sont mortes.

Les protocoles scientifiques sont en théorie sensés prendre en compte des ""points limites"" de douleur. Dans la réalité, ils ne sont pas toujours respectés, comme en atteste cette enquête. Certaines souris perdent leurs yeux dans ces expériences, ou deviennent aveugles. D'autres meurent de leurs souffrances. Certains protocoles prévoient même de ne pas les anesthésier, pour ne pas interférer avec les résultats des expériences.

La directive européenne qui encadre ces expériences érige normalement trois règles centrales, baptisées les trois R: la réduction du nombre d'animaux, le raffinement dans leur prise en charge, et, à terme, leur remplacement.

""Le modèle des animaux n'est pas forcément le bon""

Dans les faits, témoigne la lanceuse d'alerte, les scientifiques poursuivent les tests sur animaux par habitude. Quand, elle les interrogent à ce sujet, ils lui répondent ainsi: ""parce que quand j'ai fait des études, on a étudié sur des souris, quand on échange avec des confrères ou à travers les pays, comme tout le monde a déjà travaillé avec des souris, on continue à le faire"".

Pour les animaliers qui travaillent avec ces animaux, cette situation est d'autant plus dure que le veto dont ils disposent en théorie sur certaines expérience est très souvent outrepassé. ""Ça nous détruit"", insiste la technicienne. ""Il n'y a plus de goût à la vie."" Au bas de la hiérarchie, leur parole n'est guère écoutée, ajoute-t-elle.

Elle-même était dans un premier favorable à ces tests, qu'elle jugeait comme un moindre mal. Mais en intégrant le comité d'éthique du laboratoire, elle prend conscience que les souris sont traitées ""comme des objets"".

1,9 millions d'animaux ont été utilisés en 2015 dans la recherche, d'après une enquête du ministère de l'enseignement supérieur, de la recherche, et de l'innovation. Parmi tous ces cobayes, plus d'un million de souris ont été employées.

""On n'est absolument pas contre la recherche"", précise auprès de Libération Joanna Trouchaud, responsable de la communication d'Animal Testing. ""Mais on estime que le modèle des animaux n'est pas forcément le bon."" L'association, qui a lancé une pétition en ligne, demande ""qu'une commission d'enquête parlementaire ait lieu sur l'expérimentation animale"".

Visiblement, il y a de nouveau un appétit au Québec pour les grands projets inspirants et les campagnes positives.","Lors des élections municipales à Montréal le 5 novembre dernier, l'impensable s'est produit : le maire Denis Coderre, que tous croyaient invincible, a mangé une volée électorale aux mains de Projet Montréal et sa cheffe Valérie Plante, pourtant inconnue de tous il y a quelques semaines. Cette victoire de Mme Plante, tout sourire, est un véritable pied de nez au maire bougon et arrogant qu'incarnait Denis Coderre, prouvant une fois de plus que ça paye de faire de la politique positive.

Contrairement à Denis Coderre, qui menait une campagne confiante, à défaut d'être inspirante, Valérie Plante a fait les choses différemment : le sourire aux lèvres, elle a arpenté les rues de la métropole avec un projet bien clair pour Montréal. Entre autres, sa nouvelle ligne rose, un projet de mobilité concret, a visiblement séduit bon nombre de Montréalais, puisque plus de la moitié d'entre eux ont choisi de lui accorder leur confiance. Comme jamais, elle a prouvé qu'une campagne positive, qui met de l'avant un projet structurant et concret sait inspirer les électeurs beaucoup plus qu'une série d'attaques personnelles. Aujourd'hui, Valérie Plante incarne la politique moderne, celle qui sait faire rêver plutôt que de rabaisser le débat à un vulgaire combat de boxe oratoire.

En effet, ce qui a dominé la campagne de Projet Montréal et sa candidate à la mairie, ce n'est pas leur hargne envers Denis Coderre, mais bien leur intention de changer Montréal pour le mieux. Cette attitude positive et cette manière de faire de la politique sont séduisantes pour beaucoup d'électeurs, sans surprise : quand un(e) candidat(e) sait inspirer par sa vision inspirante de l'avenir et faire rêver ses concitoyens, il saura mobiliser beaucoup plus qu'un candidat qui fait campagne principalement en attaquant ses adversaires. C'est ce que Mme Plante a fait à Montréal et elle en récolte présentement les fruits.

Il est également pertinent de mentionner que 375 ans après sa fondation par Maisonneuve et Jeanne Mance, Montréal a choisi pour la première fois de se doter d'une mairesse.

Un pas de géant pour la cause des femmes en politique, puisque la plus grande ville du Québec est désormais dirigée par une femme.

Un autre constat à formuler après la victoire surprise de Valérie Plante est que les trente jours de campagne électorale sont plus importants à eux seuls que les quatre années de mandat d'un gouvernement, quel qu'il soit. Avant sa publicité-choc affirmant qu'elle était « l'homme de la situation », très peu de gens connaissaient la candidate à la mairie de Projet Montréal. Tout au long de la campagne, elle s'est fait connaître et son taux d'appui a augmenté en conséquence, au fur et à mesure que son discours rassembleur et porteur d'espoir se propageait. Comme lors de la campagne fédérale de 2015, celui qui a commencé premier a subi une défaite épique et celui qu'on donnait battu a su triompher, prouvant que la campagne électorale compte plus que jamais.

À l'heure où la CAQ tente de se faire du capital politique sur le dos des soi-disant « vieux partis » et depuis le temps que le PLQ fait campagne contre les « méchants séparatistes », il y a de la place sur la scène politique québécoise pour un parti qui mise sur des grands projets de société pour faire rêver les Québécois.

Interrogé sur le chef de l'État français, Dominique Strauss-Kahn estime qu'Emmanuel Macron ""est en train d'agir étonnamment bien"".

L'azienda ha ammesso il malfunzionamento e ha annunciato che verrà sistemato al più presto.","Inserire la ""i"" sui messaggi sta diventato un problema per i possessori di un iPhone. A pochi giorni dal lancio mondiale del prodotto celebrativo iPhone X, infatti, i dispositivi Apple stanno registrando qualche problema, così come molti utenti hanno riportato sui social media. Un bug (errore informatico) che, visto il costo degli ultimi nati in casa Cupertino, ha fatto arrabbiare più di qualche fan del marchio.

La lettera ""I"" (che, tra l'altro, in inglese equivale al nostro ""io"") non viene riconosciuta come corretta dal sistema operativo iOS 11, il quale vorrebbe correggere ogni occorrenza della lettera con una ""a"": un comportamento strano registrato anche gli iPad e che - considerando la ""i"" iniziale distintiva dei prodotti Apple - sembra proprio uno scherzo del destino.

This ""I"" autocorrect iOS bug is like a virus taking over everyones iPhone lol — Kenny ⚡️ (@imkenny_) 6 novembre 2017

Il bug ha colpito ogni app in cui viene utilizzata la tastiera, tra cui, quindi, anche Instagram, Twitter e Facebook. A ogni modo, niente paura: è possibile correggere il malfunzionamento della tastiera, modificando le lettere interne a una parola già digitata. Una procedura che rallenta la scrittura, ma attualmente inevitabile.

The Collins Dictionary has said the ""word of the year"" is ""fake news"" though of course that's two words. It had seen an unprecedented usage increase of 365% since 2016. ""Fake news today is legitimate news,"" it said.

Helen Newstead, the head of language content, said, ""Fake news, either as a statement of fact or as an accusation, has been inescapable, contributing to the undermining of society's trust in news reporting.""

While Trump may have helped Fake News win the word-of-the-year mantle, India has been quite a fake news factory.

Now, according to Asian Age, the government is contemplating cracking down on fake news.

And about time. Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

The government has said official advertisements should be denied to outlets that indulge in ""unethical reporting"", news published out of ""bad intent"" and ""fake news"".

The Directorate of Advertising & Visual Publicity will stop release of advertisements to such publications. Until now the print media policy already stated a newspaper could be suspended from empanelment if it was found to have deliberately submitted false information regarding circulation.

This is not symbolic. Government ads are a major source of revenue for media.

The devil, as always, lies in the details. What is fake news? And who defines it? Who defines bad intent? Clearly one person's fake news is another person's truth or at least their agenda.

Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

Take a few recent examples:

During the riots in Basirhat, an image of a burning vehicle was sent out as part of a call to #SaveBengal. It was shared by Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson from Delhi and used on a flyer for protests. The image, it turned out, was from the 2002 Gujarat riots under Narendra Modi's watch.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya has been caught more than once peddling fake news, tweets he has refused to take down even after they have been proved to be false. Once he circulated a mischievously edited video clip of NDTV anchor Ravish Kumar. Another time during the Ram Rahim trial he posted a picture of Rahul Gandhi meeting Sant Niranjan Dass of Dera Sach Khand Ballan but captioned it as ""Rahul Gandhi visited Dera Sach Sauda as recently as Jan 2017 to seek support.""

BJP leader Priti Gandhi posted Julian Assange's fake endorsement of Narendra Modi for Prime Minister which Wikileaks had to deny.

These could be honest mistakes. Who among us has not fallen for fake news, especially when it fits our ideological bias? But sometimes it's far more deliberate and it comes from within the government itself, not some mischief monger on social media.

The state-run Press Information Bureau infamously photoshopped a picture of Narendra Modi looking at flood-ravaged Chennai with divyadrishti clarity through his chopper window. And of course, that iconic ""rare"" picture of Modi sweeping the floor at a 1988 RSS rally turned out to be a well-morphed fake photo.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Does this mean the BJP is the sole offender? Of course, not. But as Rohan Venkataramakrishnan points out in Scroll, the BJP was an ""early pioneer when it came to using the internet for organizing and building political awareness"" and it also ""has been at the forefront of the fake news phenomenon, with top party leaders and ministers occasionally revealing the kinds of dishonest messages that are much more rampant among the base.""

Even more worryingly, in a country where the phrase ""anti-national""can be used casually as a bludgeon to silence any dissent that is too bothersome, these new DAVP guidelines could just be another weapon to bring media to heel. The Centre has already told the Jammu and Kashmir government to stop advertising in local newspapers that allegedly publish ""anti-national""articles ""glamorizing terrorists and anti-national elements"". Shujaat Bukhari, editor of Rising Kashmir told HT that three major newspapers there, including his own, are banned from getting central government ads for eight years because they cover ""anti-national"" issues, for example, the funerals of militants. ""Now they want us to bleed more by telling the state government to stop state advertisements as well,"" he said.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Government ads have long been part of a strategy to make sure that media does not get too uppity. As other ad revenues shrink government ads gain even more clout.

In 2012, Dhirendra K. Jha dubbed Nitish Kumar Bihar's editor-in-chief because he used the government's ad budget to control and bend the media to his will. The editor of Bihartimes.com said though it has been ""No. 1"" since inception in 1999, its application for empanelment with the Public Relations Department was kept pending without any ""concrete reason"" while a site based in Bhopal with tenuous connections to Bihar got government ads. He said he believes it's because his site carries reports related to corruption in the state. An Urdu paper Pindar ran afoul of the government because of a piece by its chief editor that apparently upset the government. The editor, Raihan Ghani, said he was demoted to managing editor and eventually resigned. Curiously the year after Ghani was gagged, the paper's government ad revenues ballooned from 1 lakh to 24 and the year after to 40 lakh.

When the ABP group in Bengal was perceived at loggerheads with the Trinamool government, Mamata Banerjee had banned their newspapers from state libraries. Global campaign group Avaaz said that five West Bengal outdoor advertising agencies and one newspaper group refused to run ads urging Mamata Banerjee to ""stop attacking protesters and start attacking the problem"" after the gangrape of a young woman in Kamduni. Jayalalithaa's Tamil Nadu was boomtown for lawsuits against media perceived as being overly critical of the government. In five years it filed 213 defamation cases against political opponents, 55 of them against media houses for ""derogatory "" statements whether it was reporting on the CM's vacations or water scarcity in Tamil Nadu. Its predecessor DMK was a poor second with 40 cases between 2006 and 2011.

The government's idea to crack down on fake news sounds like good news. Who could argue with punishing the purveyors of fake news? But the fear is it will have little to do with promoting free and fair journalism and far more to do with the carrot-and-stick policy that makes media toe the line.

A new survey of almost 2,000 health-care workers being released on Monday by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) bears out that contention.
And it isn't only front-line staff like nurses and personal support workers who are being subjected to physical and verbal attacks, he said.
""The rate of assault against clerical staff, against cleaners, against dietary aides would be in the neighbourhood of about 34 per cent.""
Another factor is that the health-care sector is female-dominant — 85 per cent of staff are women — and societal attitudes are reflected within hospitals' walls, Hurley suggested.","TORONTO — As a 42-year nursing veteran of Ontario's hospital system, Linda Clayborne is no stranger to what's become a growing phenomenon — escalating incidents of violence perpetrated by patients and even family members against front-line health-care staff.

""I've been kicked, spat on, bit, pushed and had verbal abuse,"" said Clayborne, who retired in June 2016 from St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton and now works part-time doing private nursing.

""Violence is really a daily occurrence at the hospital,"" said Clayborne, who spent much of career working as a forensic psychiatric nurse.

Linda Clayborne, a forensic nurse who is now retired after 32 years, is photographed at her home in Hamilton, Ont. on Saturday.

But she said it's a scenario played out in hospitals across the province and throughout Canada, with nurses, personal support workers and other staff bearing the brunt of patients' emotional meltdowns.

A new survey of almost 2,000 health-care workers being released on Monday by the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU) bears out that contention.

Almost 70 per cent of respondents reported experiencing at least one incident of physical violence in the past year, while 20 per cent said they had been subjected to such assaults nine or more times during that period.

Eighty-three per cent said they had endured at least one incident of non-physical abuse, such as name-calling, threatening gestures or intimidation, with 35 per cent reporting at least nine such occurrences in the last year.

42 per cent sexually harassed, assaulted

Sexual harassment or assault also occurred, with 42 per cent of workers reporting at least one incident, and six per cent saying it happened nine times or more.

OCHU president Michael Hurley called the findings ""staggering.""

And it isn't only front-line staff like nurses and personal support workers who are being subjected to physical and verbal attacks, he said. ""The rate of assault against clerical staff, against cleaners, against dietary aides would be in the neighbourhood of about 34 per cent.""

Hurley said violence by patients and family members can occur in virtually any part of a hospital, from the emergency department to the intensive care unit to obstetrics.

""They may be people with mental illness, people high on opiates, people distressed about the quality of their care, or distressed about the length of time they've waited — and they take that aggression out on the health-care staff that they meet.""

Had she had a Plexiglas barrier completely around her, that (assault) couldn't have happened. Micheal Hurley, OCHU president

He cited the recent case of a mentally ill man who had come to a Smiths Falls, Ont., hospital and grabbed a pair of blunt scissors off the admitting clerk's desk and ""plunged them"" into her neck.

""Had she had a Plexiglas barrier completely around her, that couldn't have happened,"" said Hurley, adding that budget restraints often mean hospitals aren't making even such minimal investments to protect staff.

Another factor is that the health-care sector is female-dominant — 85 per cent of staff are women — and societal attitudes are reflected within hospitals' walls, Hurley suggested.

""You've got in Canadian society, unfortunately, a very high degree of tolerance for violence against women,"" he said.

""So you've got this general societal attitude and it doesn't stop at the door of the hospital. It comes right in and it's compounded by the fact that if you assault someone in a hospital, you may not face charges.""

Ambulances drive through the emergency department at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto on Oct. 20 2016.

Clayborne said violent incidents began rising about 15 years ago, in lockstep with ongoing staff cuts that left front-line workers to deal with unruly patients, where once trained crisis teams were there to respond.

""In my opinion as a nurse, I am there to nurse, to nurture, to help people get well,"" she said. ""It's become an expectation that I become part of the goon squad, so to speak.""

""For me and my colleagues, we don't want to do that. We've been hurt, we've been thrown to the floor. I had my head banged against the wall.""

Clayborne said she was traumatized by one incident in particular: a Code White — an SOS when a worker is in trouble — was called during one shift and she and other staff went racing to help a nurse who was being attacked by a male patient.

We've been hurt, we've been thrown to the floor. I had my head banged against the wall. Linda Clayborne

""She was on the floor in the fetal position ... and all I could hear was the thump of his foot against her back,"" she said.

In another incident, a worker was struck by a food tray and thrown to the ground, hitting her head on a cement floor. She suffered permanent brain damage.

Scott Sharp is also trying to recover from what may be permanent injury from an attack.

The personal support worker was on the midnight shift in the emergency department at a Guelph, Ont., hospital in January 2015 when he ran to help co-workers restrain a physically aggressive young man who was high on crystal meth.

""He punched me in the face, like uppercut me,"" recalled Sharp, 48, who lives in nearby Elora.

Sharp lost his balance and slid under the gurney. His back then hit the floor and his head slammed through a steel rack and into a wall.

Devastation for some health workers

The father of four ended up with spinal damage that has left him reliant on a walker or crutches, suffering chronic pain and bladder-control problems.

Sharp said he has had difficulty getting compensation from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), which refused to pay for some of his medications.

And when his wife had to take time off work to be his caregiver for many months, she didn't get paid, devastating the family financially.

I shouldn't, but I think back that if I hadn't have let my guard down, I'd still be the dad I was before and I'd still be the husband I was before. Scott Sharp, who suffered spinal damage after incident

""We ended up losing our house,"" said Sharp, his voice breaking.

""I shouldn't, but I think back that if I hadn't have let my guard down, I'd still be the dad I was before and I'd still be the husband I was before.""

While he had lots of support from co-workers, that wasn't the case with hospital administrators, said Sharp, who wants to see more accountability from upper management in cases of workplace violence.

But under legislation, hospitals can't be sued for work-related injuries. Police and public prosecutors typically discourage workers from seeking charges against patients, especially those with dementia, mental illness or under the influence of drugs, because conviction is unlikely, Hurley of OCHU said.

Union: More gov't protection, accountability

""It's not that we want people to be prosecuted ... but from our perspective it should be the courts that make that determination whether a person at the time of the attack (understood) the nature of what they were doing or not.""

OCHU also wants hospitals to beef up protection for staff and it is calling on the Ontario government to provide enhanced legal protection for people who report violent incidents to their superiors _ something both Hurley and Clayborne said most workers are reluctant to do because they fear reprisals.

""I think that the hospital has to have some responsibility to keep us safe,"" said Clayborne, including ""going to the government and saying: 'Our employees are being beaten and we need the money to keep them safe.'

""But it's not happening.""

CANBERRA -- One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has launched her Queensland election campaign on Monday with a champagne start to her party's ""Battler Bus"" tour of the state's regions.

While a smash of bubbly is a common choice for christening a vessel, the use of champagne fizz in this instance has caught the eye of a few political opponents as being not exactly ""battlerish"".

The launch of the white and blue bus bearing Hanson's face constitutes a late joining of the Queensland election trail for the senator as she was caught out of the country on a parliamentary trip to India when the Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called the election.

Hanson confirmed a preference deal with the Katter's Australian Party ahead of Labor and the LNP but would not confirm whether the two parties would vote together as a block in the next state parliament.

""I think it's time for One Nation and honestly I think this is going to be bigger than what it was in 1998,"" she told reporters in Brisbane before the bus took off.

The Battler Bus also includes a hashtag for people to follow on social media, #PeopleB4Politics.

A quick search of the hashtag did not find a flood of One Nation mentions; rather it has been used in United Kingdom in a campaign to protect the rights of millions of European citizens who live in the UK but will be affected by Brexit.

'The3million' campaign wants EU nationals to maintain their current rights under a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

In particular they want EU nationals to keep the right to bring family members to the UK, including from outside the EU, as now.

Et cette fois, ce sont les noms de proches de Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump mais aussi Elizabeth II qui ressortent dans la première série de révélations.

Les ""Paradise Papers"" sont le fruit d'une fuite de données du cabinet de conseil britannique Appleby, spécialisés dans les montages off-shores. Toutefois, à la différence des Panama Papers qui mettaient en lumière un système illégal, les premiers Paradise Papers dévoilés ce dimanche 5 novembre parlent de montages sophistiqués mais légaux qui relèvent plus de l'optimisation fiscale que de la fraude, mais qui interrogent davantage sur la moralité des personnalités concernées.

Wilbur Ross, secrétaire d'état au commerce américain

Parmi les premiers noms à faire surface ce dimanche 5 novembre, se trouve celui de Wilbur Ross, actuel secrétaire américain du commerce de Donald Trump. Lors de sa nomination, l'homme d'affaire a cédé 80 de ses sociétés, dans le but d'éviter tout conflit d'intérêt avec son nouveau poste. Il a cependant gardé le contrôle d'une entreprise de transport maritime ""Navigator Holdings Ltd"", qui lui rapporterait, selon les informations dévoilées ce dimanche, ""plusieurs millions de dollars chaque année"" et ""concurrence pourtant directement les entreprises de transport américaines"", indique Le Monde.

Autre information susceptible de provoquer un nouveau tollé dans l'administration: les liens de l'entreprise de Wilbur Ross avec l'une des plus grosses sociétés russes de gaz et de pétrole, ""Sibur"", dirigée par des proches de Vladimir Poutine. Comme le précise Le Monde, Sibur est actuellement la propriété d'un des gendres du président russe, Kirill Chamalov, et de Guennadi Timtchenko, qui a déjà fait les frais des sanctions économiques américaines après l'invasion de la Crimée.

Stephen Bronfman, ""le gars de la finance"" de Trudeau

Stephen Bronfman est l'un des soutiens de la première heure de Justin Trudeau, dont il est l'ancien trésorier de campagne. Une campagne que le premier ministre canadien a remporté notamment grâce à ses positions contre l'évasion fiscale. Mais selon les informations révélées par les Paradise Papers, Stephen Bronfman et sa société Claridge auraient investi dans une structure financière opaque des îles Caîman -un ""trust"" baptisé le Kolber Trust. L'objectif étant bien sûr d'échapper à certaines taxes.

Comme le rappelle Le Monde, posséder un ""trust"" au Canada n'est pas illégal, à condition de respecter certaines règles: ainsi l'entreprise n'est exemptée de taxe que si les décisions la concernant sont prises hors du territoire canadien. Ce qui, selon les révélations des Paradise Papers, n'a pas été le cas pour le trust Kolbert.

Elizabeth II, le duché de Lancastre et Brighthouse

Dans la longue liste du patrimoine royal britannique, figure le ""Duché de Lancaster"", une société chargée de gérer les biens de la reine. Selon les révélations des Paradise Paper, ce duché a investi 7,5 millions de dollars dans un fonds situé aux îles Caïman, qui aurait par la suite investi dans une chaîne britannique d'électroménager ""Brighthouse"".

Or cette chaîne a déjà provoqué la polémique au Royaume-Uni pour ses méthodes de ventes agressives et des surfacturations de clients, mais aussi pour avoir réduit de façon drastique le montant de ses impôts, grâce à un prêt accordé à une société luxembourgeoise, comme le souligne Le Monde.

Erziehungsexperten versuchen Antworten darauf zu finden, warum inzwischen schon bei Grundschülern Burnout-Syndrome diagnostiziert werden und was eigentlich aus der Idee einer unbeschwerten Kindheit geworden ist.

Kaum jemand im deutschsprachigen Raum hat sich mit dem Thema Kindererziehung wohl so lange und lebensnah beschäftigt wie der Schweizer Kinderarzt Remo Largo.

Auch wenn sein erstes Buch “Babyjahre” schon fast zwei Jahrzehnte alt ist, gehört es noch immer zur Grundausstattung junger Eltern.

Viele Eltern wollen ihr Kind maximal fördern - auch über sein Potenzial hinaus

Seit mehr als 30 Jahren befasst sich der “bekannteste Kinderarzt der Schweiz” mit der kindlichen Entwicklung und dem Einfluss, den unsere Gesellschaft darauf hat.

Largo, der selbst Vater von drei Töchtern und auch lange schon Großvater ist, beobachtet ein entscheidendes Problem in der modernen Erziehung: Er ist der Ansicht, dass viele Eltern eine falsche Vorstellung davon haben, wie ihr Kind zu einem glücklichen, erfolgreichen Menschen heranwächst.

“Ein Kind ist darauf ausgelegt, sein Begabungspotenzial auszuschöpfen”, sagte er der HuffPost. “Doch in unserer Gesellschaft ist das für viele unglaublich schwer geworden.”

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt, was Kinder mehr als alles andere von ihren Eltern brauchen

Schuld sei ein Irrglaube, dem viele Eltern unterliegen. “Viele Eltern versuchen, ihr Kind über sein Begabungspotenzial hinaus zu fördern”, erklärt er. “Das ist aber nicht möglich.”

Die Folge: “Sie überfordern das Kind und verunsichern es.”

Eltern müssen die Grenzen ihrer Kinder akzeptieren

Largo zieht einen simplen Vergleich: “Jedes Kind ist verschieden groß. Wenn ein Kind zu wenig Nahrung bekommt, wird es kleiner. Wird es überfüttert, wird es nicht größer, sondern nur dick. So ist es auch mit den geistigen Fähigkeiten.”

So wie das körperliche Wachstum eines Kindes also limitiert ist, stößt es auch bei seinen Begabungen und Stärken an klare Grenzen.

(Das hat Largo übrigens zu Kindern zu sagen, die nicht gehorchen; der Text geht nach dem Video weiter:)

Ein Kinderarzt erklärt: Das ist der oft übersehene Grund, warum Kinder ihren Eltern nicht gehorchen





Eltern müssten erkennen und akzeptieren, dass ihr Kind in manchen Feldern besser sei als in anderen und dass es nichts bringe, die nicht so stark ausgeprägten Fähigkeiten ohne Rücksicht auf seine eigentlichen Bedürfnisse verbessern zu wollen, erklärt Largo.

Dass Eltern ihre Kinder über ihr Potenzial hinaus versuchen zu fördern, lässt sich laut Largo durch den gesellschaftlichen Druck erklären.

Zu viel Förderung führt nicht zu mehr Erfolg

Andere Eltern und Erzieher in der Kita setzten Maßstäbe, wie weit ein Kind in einem bestimmten Alter in seiner Entwicklung sein müsse. Und in der Schule gehe es weiter - mit starren Lehrplänen und oft unflexiblen Lehrern.

“Wenn das eigene Kind dann beispielsweise weniger gut lesen und rechnen kann, als es nach dieser Vorstellung sollte, löst das bei den meisten Eltern Ängste aus.”

Die Reaktion vieler Eltern: stärkere Förderung - auch dort, wo das Potenzial des Kindes bereits voll ausgeschöpft ist. Damit entstehe die Gefahr der Überlastung, warnt Largo.

“Eltern dürfen ihre Kinder nicht überfordern”, sagt er. “Die zunehmende Zahl der Burnout-Fälle selbst bei Kindern zeigt aber, dass viele Eltern genau das tun. Die Kinder wollen dann nicht mehr lernen, können nicht mehr schlafen, fühlen sich niedergeschlagen.”

Largos Rat: “Bemerken Eltern, dass sie ihr Kind überfordern, sollten sie sich selbst hinterfragen und sich ehrlich überlegen, weshalb sie solchen Druck machen.”

Viele Eltern machen sich selbst großen Druck

Die Ursache für ein solches Verhalten der Eltern, so Largos Erfahrung, sei nämlich in vielen Fällen gleich.

“Der Grund ist häufig die eigene existenzielle Verunsicherung der Eltern”, sagt er.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Das passiert mit Kindern, die früh in die Kita kommen

“Sie haben Angst, dass sie ihren Lebensstandard nicht halten können und fürchten, dass die Lebensqualität für ihre Kinder nicht mehr so hoch sein könnte wie bei ihnen. Sie versuchen deshalb, die Kinder extrem zu fördern - in dem Glauben, das mache die Kinder klüger und damit auch erfolgreicher. Doch das ist ein Irrglaube.”

Was sollten Eltern also anders machen? Largos Antwort darauf ist einfach.

Kinder müssten nicht die ganze Zeit beschäftigt und gefördert werden.

Eltern sollten ihre Kinder sinnvolle Erfahrungen machen lassen

“Eltern sollten Vertrauen haben in die Kinder”, sagt er. “Ihre Aufgabe ist nicht, die Kinder mit allen möglichen Dingen zu fördern, sondern ihnen sinnvolle Erfahrungen zu ermöglichen, zum Beispiel mit anderen Kindern.”

Dann, so erklärt er, werde das Kind auch Erfolg haben. “Denn es wählt das aus, was es für seine Entwicklung braucht und was es kann.”

Ohne diese Erfahrungen werde ein Kind verunsichert - und das habe laut Largo wiederum negative Auswirkungen auf sein Lernverhalten. Bei einer übermäßigen Förderung kann sich außerdem der gewünschte Effekt umkehren und das Kind stattdessen Lernschwierigkeiten entwickeln.

“Ein Neunjähriger ist dann beispielsweise beim Lesen auf dem Entwicklungsstand eines Siebenjährigen - obwohl seine Eltern genau das Gegenteil erreichen wollten - nämlich, dass er besser ist als die Anderen.”

Falsche Förderung führt zu einer Überforderung

Diese falsche Förderung führe zwangsläufig zu einer Überforderung in der Schule und diese wiederum zu Misserfolgen, warnt der Mediziner.

Die Folgen seien dramatisch: “Das Gefühl des Versagens zerstört das Selbstwertgefühl immer mehr, bis wir es mit einem zutiefst verunsicherten Erwachsenen zu tun haben, der sich nichts zutraut und Probleme hat, sich in der Berufswelt zurechtzufinden.”



Und damit ist Largo bei einer Botschaft angelangt, die er seit Jahrzehnten predigt - Kinder so nehmen, wie sie sind.



“Es ist deshalb wichtig zu akzeptieren, dass sich jedes Kind auf seine Weise und in seinem Tempo entwickeln will. Dazu gehört also anzuerkennen, dass jedes Kind anders ist.”



Eine Botschaft, die sich alle Eltern noch mehr zu Herzen nehmen sollten - auch wenn sie völlig selbstverständlich klingt.

However, according to a new British study, one in 10 men, ages 18 to 34, are now opting to take their wife's last names.

The study, which was published by the London Mint Office, proves that people's attitudes towards marriage traditions are changing. Today, 72 per cent of young married couples adopt the groom's surname, compared to 97 per cent of married couples over age 55, who were likely married a generation earlier, CBS Pittsburgh notes.

There are plenty of reasons why a man would choose to buck tradition and take their wife's surname instead of vice versa, including refusing to adhere to the patriarchy, to simply liking the sound of their partner's last name over their own.

However, some newlyweds aren't doing either or, but are instead choosing to adopt a new identity altogether by hyphenating their surnames. According to the British survey of over 2,000 adults, 11 per cent of married couples are choosing to go this route.

Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh during a visit to Stirling Castle.

This research coincides with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's upcoming platinum wedding anniversary on Nov. 20. After Elizabeth became the Queen in 1952, the Duke of Edinburgh requested the Royal Family adopt his surname, Mountbatten. However, the Queen decided against this and retained her father's name, Windsor.

This was a modern decision for the Queen as, at that time, it was unprecedented for a man take his wife's surname.

Today, a number of male celebrities have also opted to take their wife's last name, including Zoe Saldana's husband, née Marco Perego, and John Lennon, who adopted his wife Yoko Ono's surname as one of his middle names. It has also been reported that Jay Z hyphenated his surname with Beyoncé's to become Shawn Knowles-Carter.

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Sep 16, 2017 at 3:54pm PDT

Other changing attitudes about marriage include the idea that monogamy is key to a successful marriage. According to the study, only 36 per cent of people surveyed believe this is true.

Instead, 73 per cent place respect for one another as a top factor for a lifelong marriage, while 70 per cent say maintaining a sense of humour is key.

So the over 100 million people across the world who subscribe to the service have an inevitable paralysis of choice ― and not every show is going to be a hit. Honestly, most are kind of mediocre. But the service has a record of putting out at least a few gems every year, all of which will hopefully end up in the ever-changing list below.

Netflix has become that friend who just won’t stop proposing outlandish new ideas. You definitely love a thing or two they come up with, but at a certain point, it’s simply way too much to process.

For the weekend of Nov. 4, Streamline recommends “Alias Grace” in the top spot, unseating “Stranger Things 2.” This is the second adaptation of a Margaret Atwood novel to earn critical buzz this year, following “The Handmaid’s Tale.” It likely won’t have the same cultural takeover that “The Handmaid’s Tale” achieved given its more subtle feminist message, lack of immediate connection timing-wise to Donald Trump’s election and far more subdued costuming choices. But this could still be a sleeper hit and is well worth checking out.

Netflix could use another hit right now to distract from the week they’ve had involving actor Kevin Spacey. Over the last several days, multiple people accused Spacey of sexual harassment, including underage men. The service’s first hit show, “House of Cards,” stars Spacey. Netflix first announced that the season currently in production would be its last and then subsequently suspended all operations.

The last season of that show was already a mess with multiple characters getting killed off for increasingly ridiculous reasons and Spacey’s character getting increasingly marginalized. Within the current narrative arch of the show, it actually wouldn’t be that ridiculous to just have Spacey’s character assassinated and cede the project to Robin Wright. This could be considered heading in the Wright direction.

HuffPost also reported on the multiple rape accusations against “The Ranch” star Danny Masterson. That sitcom also stars Ashton Kutcher, his former co-star on “That 70s Show.” Netflix has not announced a chance of plans for “The Ranch” as of yet.

“Stranger Things 2” debuted last week to much buzz, but has fallen a few spots on the Streamline list. It still appears to be very popular, but many critics and fans expressed that this season didn’t quite live up to their expectations.

HuffPost writer Bill Bradley enjoyed the second season, but felt it was trying a bit too hard to not be confused for family fare. One joke in particular that involved a double entendre with the phrase “pull out” seemed hilariously out of place. Still, if you enjoyed the first season, this new story is worth your time.

“Mindhunter” is getting more buzz and moved up the list again. Much like the start of “House of Cards,” David Fincher directed the episodes that start this series. As mentioned before, “Mindhunter” continues to be the most ridiculous name on television right now.

The estate of former INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, actress Nicole Kidman and the Australian arm of mining giant Glencore have become entangled in the largest leak of information in history, a mammoth journalistic investigation on the world's tax havens dubbed the Paradise Papers.

The leak -- 13.4 million documents and 1.4 terabytes of data -- was obtained by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which further shared the trove with nearly 100 media partners worldwide.

Included in the leak -- alongside links to Queen Elizabeth, U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- are several prominent Australian identities.

As the Australian Financial Review reported ""many senior Australian business figures appear in the data in their entirely legitimate roles as executives and directors of offshore subsidiaries and some ASX-listed companies. It should be noted these are standard, legal business structures.""

As The Guardian and the ABC report, one of the more intriguing disclosures is information about the estate of deceased INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.

The Paradise Papers show how the singer's former lawyer Colin Diamond claimed key parts of Hutchence's estate, and embarked on a plan revolving around ""commercial exploitation of the sound recordings, images, films and related materials embodying the performance of Michael Hutchence"".

Papers included in the leak show Diamond's plans for a company called Helipad Plain, which was created in Mauritius in 2015. The ABC reports the company was involved in plans to commercially exploit the 20th anniversary of Hutchence's death, including a documentary, releasing previously unheard songs, and a film.

A deep investigation into the case of Hutchence will air on ABC's Four Corners on Monday night.

The Guardian reports the Australian arm of mining company Glencore was ""involved in cross-currency swaps of up to $25bn of a type under specific investigation by the Australian tax office"". These type of swaps, while legal, are being investigated by the ATO with suspicion they may be used to avoid tax by shuttling interest payments from high-tax nations to low-tax nations.

The papers show that Bermuda-based and Australian-based arms of Glencore swapped billions of dollars in Australian currency to American currency in 2013.

Glencore's Australian arm moved billions through Bermuda https://t.co/k2MsRosopk — Gareth Hutchens (@grhutchens) November 5, 2017

Actress Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban are also named in the papers; The Australian Financial Review reported the pair registered a limited liability partnership in Tennessee in 2014. The company, Island 67 LLC, was then registered in in the Bahamas in March 2015 as a foreign company attempting to buy land in the country.

Closer to home, the fallout over the Paradise Papers release has struck instantly in Canberra. The ATO confirmed it had been made aware of the investigation in recent weeks, and stood ready to take action on any Australians avoiding tax obligations.

""We anticipate further data may be published by the ICIJ and the ATO will continue to work closely with other tax administrations to share intelligence on advisers operating globally,"" ATO deputy commissioner for international affairs, Mark Konza, said in a statement.

""Domestically, we are working with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Federal Police, and Austrac to further cross-check data and build our intelligence base, undertake audits, apply significant tax penalties where appropriate and refer cases to the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce for criminal investigation.""

Konza said the ATO ""investigate all leads and have the resources and expertise to take action against taxpayers or intermediaries found to be caught-up in the illegal use of offshore structures or providers"".

In an interview on ABC radio on Monday, Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison said the ATO was ""on the front foot"" in regards to investigating any Australian misdoing exposed in the Paradise Papers publication.

""Australia is doing what we must be doing in relation to these latest revelations. We have been leading the charge in relation to international jurisdictions since the last set of papers,"" Morrison said at a doorstop interview later on Monday.

""As we heard at Estimates, the ATO said that Australia's laws, particularly on multinational tax avoidance, were exactly what they need to be to enable the ATO to get the job done. The ATO have also said they have the resources. They have more than 1,000 people at the ATO who are working specifically on issues related to companies, multinationals and private companies.""

Morrison said the Government had been working hard on ensuring big corporations met their tax obligations in Australia.

""Pay your tax. That has always been my message to big multinationals. Pay your tax based on what you earn here in Australia. The good news is that it is happening more and more often. The tax office has pointed to $4 billion of settlements, around about $1 billion of which have been specifically able to be dealt with because of our tougher multinational anti-avoidance laws,"" he said.

""On top of that we have about $7 billion worth of sales which have come back into the GST net because of our tougher multinational anti avoidance laws. So my message to multinationals is pay your tax and increasingly that is exactly what they are doing.""

""Not only are we doing everything that the ATO believes we should be doing but when you look around the world we have now one of the toughest, if not the toughest jurisdiction on multinational tax avoidance of anywhere in the world.""

Labor, however, is calling on the Government to do more. The opposition assistant treasurer Dr Andrew Leigh said more needed to be done to expose these 'tax havens'.

""Until the Government commits to a comprehensive Tax Haven Transparency package, as Labor has, the public is going to rely on Paradise Papers style leaks to expose the murky use of tax havens,"" he said in a statement.

The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government over the death of 26 people in a blast at an NTPC plant in Rae Bareli.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar has resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia and left India with a missed opportunity to prove its neighbourly worth.

When Osama bin Laden wasn't planning terrorist attacks, such as 9/11, he was apparently watching YouTube videos like ""Charlie Bit My Finger"", among other pop cultural things, such as Tom & Jerry cartoons.

Main News

The CIA has released over 470,000 files from the raid carried out on the late Osama bin Laden's hideout, excluding classified information sensitive to national security, as also a cache of pornography, pop songs and malware.

All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Scientists have found a previously undiscovered hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century.

Off The Front Page

An increase in sales volumes of consumer packaged goods companies has boosted hopes of a recovery in consumption demand, indicating the possible end of the lingering effects of last year's demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax regime in July.

The United States Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed Kenneth Ian Juster as the next ambassador to India, filling a position that has been vacant for months after Richard Verma, an Obama appointee, left in the traditional churn accompanying the administration change.

Opinion

Ever since Hardik Patel came in contact with the Congress, he has been vacillating from one extreme to another. The party has also been trying a balancing act between the Patidars, Dalits and other backward classes. Will this turn of events prove to be the Congress' pain or gain? asks Aurangzeb Nashqbandi in the Hindustan Times.

The Hindu asks three leading experts whether sexual harassers should be named and shamed in public. The answers, unsurprisingly, range from 'Yes', 'No' and 'It's complicated'.

“Thor: Ragnarok” is full of a Hela lot of surprises. Yeah, the twist that Cate Blanchett’s character, Hela, was Thor’s sister got out before the movie premiered on Friday, and Mark Ruffalo accidentally live-streamed the movie at an early screening, but many of the film’s secrets remain intact, including some major cameos. Warning: “Thor: Ragnarok” spoilers below! After Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets back to Asgard, where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been ruling in an Odin (Anthony Hopkins) disguise after secretly exiling the real Odin, Thor witnesses a play honoring Loki’s “death,” which happened in “Thor: The Dark World.” (Don’t worry. The dude wasn’t really dead.)

In the play scenes, Thor is played by Luke Hemsworth, Chris’ older brother; Odin is played by Dr. Grant himself, Sam Neill; and Loki is played by Matt Damon wearing a ridiculous Loki wig. Director Taika Waititi told HuffPost the Damon cameo really happened because he’s good friends with Chris. “It was like an homage to the previous films but also being a bit more irreverent, being able to poke fun at ourselves,” he said in reference to the play scene. “Chris is very good at that. He has great self-deprecating humor.”

Steve Granitz via Getty Images Luciana Barroso and Matt Damon at the ""Thor: Ragnarok"" premiere Oct. 10.

The director said the play was planned as an in-joke for everyone who saw “Thor: The Dark World,” adding, “We shot everything the same size and the same angle and we basically copied the entire death scene from that movie.” For those who haven’t seen the previous “Thor” film, Waititi says it is still an “interesting piece of story” that helps set up Loki’s storyline. As far as the other surprises in the movie, you should probably just see them for yourself. Marvel has gone to great lengths to keep them quiet. Even the trailers were digitally altered from the final film to hide plot points. “When we came out with our first trailer, there were a few stories in we weren’t sure if we wanted in the film or not,” said Waititi. The director said they just “wanted to make a cool trailer,” but promotion “shouldn’t necessarily be just showing shots from the finished movie.” Get ready for some moments that’ll Ragna-rock your world.

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said, noting that a person in the crowd with a gun shot at the attacker and caused him to flee. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

The president woke on Monday morning in Japan to the news that a lone gunman had opened fire on churchgoers at a small Baptist church in rural Texas and killed at least 26 people and injured another 20. The dead and wounded range in age from 5 to 72 years old.

While answering questions in Tokyo, the president referred to the gunman, who multiple reports identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, as a “very deranged individual.”

But for Anangu, Uluru is a living entity, inseparable from the spirits which inhabit it.
And in the same way as you don't own your aging grandmother, the Anangu don't believe they own Uluru.
The Anangu people themselves only climb Uluru as part of their cultural ceremonies and initiation processes.","​​​​​​​

As the first rays of morning light crept over the horizon, a hush fell over the waiting crowd.

Slowly -- oh so slowly -- the distinctive black silhouette on the horizon began to glow a deep, rich red and cascades of light and shade emerged. Crests of rock became lightning rods of colour and crevices and gaps fell into an even deeper darkness.

The familiar picture postcard had come to life.

I cast my mind's eye beneath the earth's surface and tried to imagine Uluru's submerged whole, extending a colossal six kilometres beneath the red dirt.

I tried to imagine what went through the minds of the first Anangu peoples who looked on the same scene more than 20,000 years ago. It wasn't hard to understand why, to them, this is a sacred place.

A day earlier we had been walking around the base of Uluru while listening to Anangu traditional custodian Sammy Wilson recount the songlines of the Anangu ancestors. According to the Tjukurpa (the traditional law of the Anangu people), these ancestors had helped shape and form the rock's many nooks, crevices and water holes, and their spirits still reside there today.

""We are part of the land and the land is part of me,"" explained traditional custodian Sammy Wilson.

Approaching Mutitjulu Waterhole at the base of Uluru, Sammy told us of Kuniya the Python woman, who travelled to Uluru to lay her eggs and whose snakelike form could be traced through an indentation in the rock surrounding the watering hole. Since transformed into a rainbow snake, whenever the pool runs dry she will return to fill it again.

The Anangu people may no longer rely on hunting and foraging the kernels of native plants for food, and they may live in man-made houses of brick and wood, but they still have the same ties to their traditional lands.

""We are part of the land and the land is part of me,"" Sammy explained to us.

It's an experience far removed from the ""debate"" which was brewing earlier this week as it emerged that the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park's management would vote to close the national icon to climbers in two years' time.

While many supported the move out of respect to the site's first peoples, it was the voices of dissent that seemed to proclaim the loudest. Sentiments amounting to ""it's just a big rock"" and ""we're all Australian, we should all be able to climb"" were common repetitions on a theme.

The idea that the Anangu people ""don't own"" Uluru was also raised more than once by the armchair warriors. Well, the Anangu people would agree with the facts -- if not the sentiment -- of such words.

Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park was handed back to the Anangu people in 1985 and is run by a indigenous-majority board of management, so they do in fact ""own"" the site, alongside Australian Parks and Wildlife, according to a Western understanding of the word.

But for Anangu, Uluru is a living entity, inseparable from the spirits which inhabit it. And in the same way as you don't own your aging grandmother, the Anangu don't believe they own Uluru. Rather, they are custodians -- and it's a responsibility they take very seriously.

Mitijulu Waterhole is one of several pools around the base of Uluru.

Each time someone dies or is harmed climbing Uluru, instead of self-righteously proclaiming ""serves you right"", the locals express their grief. So you can only imagine their horror when they discover that the site's watering holes, many of them sacred, have been polluted by the excrement of visiting tourists who scale the rock.

The Anangu people themselves only climb Uluru as part of their cultural ceremonies and initiation processes. For them, the climb is not about any individual's rights or desires. It is about paying homage to their ancestors, obeying the law of the land and respecting the natural environment.

If we can learn from their example, then a visit to Australia's iconic red centre will truly prove an enriching adventure.

Having myself crossed continents in search of new peaks to climb, I sympathise with the irresistible urge to conquer every summit. But Uluru is much more than just a rock -- more, even, than a stunning and unique Australian icon.

If this landmark decision can help us surmount the wide divide that sadly still exists between Australia's first peoples and those of us who have come since, it will prove infinitely more enriching than any selfie at the summit.",You Don't Need To Climb Uluru.

I am so pleased to announce ""Listen to America,"" a hugely ambitious, cross-country project we’re undertaking at HuffPost to understand what’s on the minds of Americans and what it means to be American in 2017. Consider this an invitation to our journey.

For journalists, listening is more important than ever. Why? First, trust in the news media is at an all-time low. We want to address that head-on, and build trust in the work we do, by visiting communities that are often ignored by national media. We’ll listen to what’s most important to them, and help tell those stories to the vast HuffPost audience.

Second, political divisions between us seem starker than ever. But at HuffPost, we believe there’s still so much that unites us as citizens. We aim to discover and highlight all that, and show what Americans have in common. As we visit 25 cities, we’ll use our bus — built out as a mobile video studio — to listen and collect hundreds if not thousands of voices, and we’ll share many of them along the way. We’ll also create ways for you to make your voice heard too, even if we aren’t coming to your hometown.

Third, as journalists, being good listeners, and getting out of our own way, are at the core of our practice. ""Listen to America"" is an opportunity to practice this skill over and over, and discover great stories out in the field, where they live.

PA Archive/PA Images Tim Martin is '100% sure' he's right on Brexit. Just don't ask him for a refund if he's wrong.

The chairman of Sainsbury’s, David Taylor, the British Retail Consortium and former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have warned Brexit without an EU trade deal will drive up food prices. Clegg said leaving the EU without a deal would mean a 22% tariff on food from the EU. Undeterred, Martin has printed his beermats for people to read as they down cheap pints at 895 Wetherspoon’s pubs across the country. The mats say prices will fall - if only politicians had the sense to “stop messing about” and follow The Wetherspoon’s Manifesto: Quit the EU without a transitional deal and use the freedom of World Trade Organisation rules to abolish tariffs our EU membership obliges us to charge on food imports from outside the bloc. The rules let you do this, he says, so long as you don’t discriminate, so his vision would mean the abolition of food tariffs from in and outside the EU.

JD Wetherspoon The Wetherspoon Manifesto

The Wetherspoon’s boss thinks axing the tariffs would take 3.5p off each meal served in the chain and 0.5p off each drink. The avuncular, staunch Brexiteer, who grew his empire from a single pub in 1979 to the huge chain it is now, has been a colourful voice in favour of Brexit. His chain is such a national institution that a scathing Sunday Times review of one of its newest pubs last weekend caused an uproar and discussion about the role cheap pubs plays in a time of poverty. The review called Martin “a multimillionaire Leave donor who’s now complaining he can’t get the staff”. This is the second time Martin has pulled the beermat stunt. Before the referendum, he put out ones posing a series of questions doubting the future of the Euro, and urging people to vote Leave. Announcing the latest beermats in a press release, he said people like Clegg and Taylor were part of “a coordinated campaign to dupe the public”. One reason he is so confident is his claim that he has not been contradicted, despite being challenged by Andrew Neil on BBC One’s This Week in September. He also set out his views in an article last month headlined: “Project Fear has morphed into Project Stupid.”

Speaking to HuffPost by phone, Martin says his claims have already circulated widely within his trade, who are “mostly Remainers” and he has had not had any reproach, “nor will I”. “What I’ve said, I’m certain it’s true... I said it on television... I contradicted Andrew Neil and not one person has come back and said ‘no, no, you’ve got that wrong Tim’.” Conventional wisdom about Brexit’s impact on food prices seems to trouble Martin. He insists there would be no need for extra custom checks, which would make food more expensive. The fall in the pound’s value, which has already fuelled inflation since the vote, also doesn’t faze him and he says its affect on food is “almost negligible”. He is more certain than anyone else in the debate, it seems. Revered think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) does not share his confidence. It said in July that Brexit’s impact on food prices was “highly uncertain”. A study by the National Institute Economic Review, published in the Guardian today, also claimed that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit could see British households’ annual shopping bills increase by up to £930 a year. LSE economist Thomas Sampson viewed Martin’s press release and told HuffPost it had a “partial truth”, as axing the tariffs would make food cheaper but only cheaper than if Britain left the EU and kept them. Sampson said: “Are food prices lower following Brexit than if we hadn’t voted to leave the EU? That’s where the claim has less to back it up.”

Son premier ministre Edouard Philippe avait alors promis de venir se rendre compte sur place du respect de cette promesse.

Deux mois plus tard, le chef du gouvernement et son ministre de l'Education Jean-Michel Blanquer ont atterri ce dimanche 5 novembre à Saint-Martin où la totalité des élèves de la partie française de l'île devraient retourner à l'école à partir de lundi. ""Nous venons pour constater la façon dont la vie reprend son cours. Nous savons que la situation sur le terrain est toujours marquée par de grandes difficultés"", a déclaré le chef du gouvernement en descendant d'avion à l'aéroport de Grand-Case. Ce dernier doit assister à une rentrée des classes dans une école saint-martinoise.

""100% des élèves inscrits et présents dans l'île pourront être scolarisés"", avait assuré en amont Michel Sanz, inspecteur d'académie et directeur académique adjoint de Saint-Barthélemy et Saint-Martin.

Sur le papier, la promesse gouvernementale est donc tenue même s'il est difficile de parler de ""retour à la normale"". Au total, 18 établissements scolaires sur 21 (16 écoles et 5 lycées-collèges) ont été touchés par l'ouragan et ses vents à plus de 350 km/h, qui ont dévasté l'île le jour de la rentrée de septembre. Depuis, le retour à l'école s'est fait de manière progressive. Un quart des élèves a pu reprendre le chemin des classes trois semaines après Irma, et d'autres écoles ont rouvert peu à peu. Officiellement, depuis le 16 octobre, tous les élèves peuvent retourner dans leur école, collège ou lycée d'origine, sauf dans six établissements: trois écoles maternelles, deux élémentaires et un collège.

Rotation et partage des locaux

Pour les élèves de ces établissements, un ""plan d'action"" a été imaginé avec un système de rotation et un partage inédit des locaux encore sur pied. A titre d'exemple, les élèves de l'école maternelle Simeonne Trott seront ainsi accueillis à l'école maternelle Evelina Halley tandis que ceux du collège Soualiga étudieront à la cité scolaire Robert Weinum.

""C'est le principe de deux écoles en une. De 7h à midi, l'établissement recevra ses élèves et ses professeurs. Et de 12h30 à 17h30, ce sont les enfants et les enseignants d'un établissement voisin sinistré qui seront sur les lieux. Et ce, cinq jours par semaine"", explique Michel Sanz. Selon l'inspecteur d'académie, un enseignement ""normal"", toutes matières confondues, sera dispensé. La volonté est de rattraper peu à peu le retard. ""Il faudra vraisemblablement (...) modifier le calendrier des prochaines vacances scolaires afin de les raccourcir, notamment pour les élèves de Terminale"", indique-t-il.

Objectif: faire en sorte que les examens de fin d'année scolaire se déroulent dans des conditions normales et aux dates prévues.

Des enseignants toujours absents?

Une partie des quelques 6089 élèves inscrits avant le passage d'Irma devrait toutefois poursuivre leur scolarité en dehors de Saint-Martin. Selon Michel Sanz, 10 à 15% des élèves sont partis du territoire ""notamment en Guadeloupe et en (métropole). Pour ceux qui sont en Guadeloupe, nous avons une vision assez claire de leur situation et de leur lieu d'affectation"". Dans l'hexagone, plusieurs familles réfugiées se sont plaintes d'avoir été abandonnées dans des hôtels. Elles ont finalement été relogées ""dans un centre d'hébergement unique"" où les enfants devaient être scolarisés.

Reste la question des enseignants, dont certains ont quitté le territoire après le passage de l'ouragan sans indiquer s'ils seraient présents ce lundi. Aucun chiffre n'a filtré sur le nombre de professeurs ayant repris du service. Sauf situations particulières, tous les enseignants que comptait l'île sont attendus lundi.

Mais ce vendredi, la ministre des Outre-mer, Annick Girardin, s'est dite ""choquée"" par les départs de certains professeurs et a évoqué de possibles sanctions. ""J'estimais qu'à partir du moment où on avait protégé sa famille (...) les enseignants après quelques jours ou quelques semaines de sas, devaient être présents, puisqu'ils sont payés, sur Saint-Martin (...) faire autre chose!"", a-t-elle dénoncé sur RTL. ""Je suis une fonctionnaire, j'estime qu'il y avait un devoir d'être présent. Pour moi, c'est de l'abandon de poste pour ceux qui ne sont pas revenus"", a-t-elle ajouté.

""Beaucoup d'enseignants sont partis après l'ouragan, mais beaucoup sont rentrés"", dédramatise le délégué interministériel chargé de la reconstruction de Saint-Barth et Saint-Martin Philippe Gustin. Le ministre de l'Éducation Jean-Michel Blanquer a lui assuré ce dimanche qu'il n'y avait ""pas de problème"", avec ""90% des enseignants"" au travail.

Melburnians are being urged to contact police if they see a smashed-in dark navy or black BMW, after a 13-year-old girl was ""left to die"" on the side of the road.

The teenager was riding her bicycle with two friends on the corner of Bell and Sussex Streets in Coburg, in Melbourne's north, just after 8pm on Sunday when she was hit by the vehicle.

She ""is absolutely fighting for life at the moment -- she may not make it,"" Assistant Commissioner Doug Fryer told a press conference on Monday morning.

The car is believed to a dark-coloured BMW sedan or coupe, with probable damage on the left-hand side and windscreen.

The girl remained in an induced coma on Monday.

""There is no doubt that person who had the crash and hit that young girl is aware of it,"" Assistant Commissioner Fryer said.

""What sort of person hits a young girl and then doesn't render assistance?""

Police are looking for a woman -- either the driver of the car or a passenger -- who was seen getting out of the BMW briefly before it fled the scene.

A former St John Ambulance cadet who stopped to help the teen has described to the Herald Sun rolling the girl onto her back and revealed ""blood all over her face"".

""It was her breathing and head that were the worst,"" Damian Nippard said.

""We were talking to her by name and telling her to keep breathing and that there was help on the way.""

""She's been hit and left to die on the side of the road,"" Detective Inspector Stuart McGregor said at a press conference.

""There is no parent -- there is no mother or father or grandparent who would ever want this to happen to their child -- let alone left on the side of the road, just to die by a person who leaves the scene and does not even bother to stop and help.""

The girl has been taken to the Royal Children's Hospital with life-threatening head injuries and broken bones, according to the ABC.

Invitée ce dimanche 5 novembre de l'émission ""Questions politiques"" France Inter/Le Monde/franceinfo, l'élue bordelaise a été interrogée sur les propos du président de la région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes qui a accusé Emmanuel Macron d'avoir une ""haine de la province"".

Interrogée sur son ralliement, paraissant contre-nature, avec Laurent Wauquiez, la première adjointe à la mairie de Bordeaux a mis en avant l'aspect ""régalien"" du projet défendu par Alain Juppé pendant la primaire de la droite.

Existen diversas razones socialmente fundamentadas que respaldan la decisión de intentar mantener la amistad con la expareja cuando la relación se rompe.

Para el miembro de la relación rechazado, la perspectiva de una amistad puede suponer una especie de premio de consolación. Quizás ya no pueda compartir cama, tener hijos ni pasar el resto de su vida con esa persona, pero al menos hay algo positivo entre las cenizas: la posibilidad de seguir hablando por teléfono, contarle las preocupaciones o ir al cine juntos.

Para la persona que decide cortar, la perspectiva de mantener la amistad puede ser igual de atractiva. Puede que haya echado de su vida al otro miembro de la relación, pero tiene sentimientos. Puede que diga eso de que no estaban hechos el uno para el otro, pero simplemente no quiere pasar el resto de su vida con esa persona, obviando el asunto del sexo. Además, se suele aferrar con firmeza a la idea de que no es un monstruo. Como sabemos, la gente simpática siempre trata de ser amiga de sus ex.

Estos argumentos pueden sonar sensatos, pero, bien analizados, se tienen que tomar con pinzas y son un desastre para ambas partes.

Mantener la amistad con los ex le hace un gran daño tanto al recuerdo de la relación como a los méritos que debe reunir una verdadera amistad.

Para quien ha sido rechazado, dar el paso de novios a amigos es una eterna humillación. De planear una vida juntos a salir a cenar el segundo jueves de cada mes hay, dicho suavemente, una pérdida de categoría. Es más, cada reencuentro con la expareja es una garantía de que se reavivará la llama de la esperanza, algo que solo conduce a una humillación mayor. Esa persona no es una amistad, sino más bien una tortura involuntaria.

Para el miembro que corta, esa ""amistad"" es un continuo recordatorio de su culpabilidad y crueldad. Ni siquiera puede estar tranquilo siendo amable, por si acaso la otra persona lo malinterpreta y, tras varias copas, se echa a llorar para pedir otra oportunidad.

La idea de ser amigos surge como un intento de respetar los buenos momentos de una relación en la que ambos miembros han invertido tanta carga emocional. No conciben la posibilidad de desaparecer de repente y completamente de sus vidas, de modo que la amistad es la solución que queda para conmemorar una fase importante de sus vidas.

Si se mira con mayor frialdad, mantener la amistad con los ex le hace un gran daño tanto al recuerdo de la relación como a los méritos que debe reunir una verdadera amistad. Es una traición a todo lo bueno que pudo tener la relación anteriormente y a los ideales de una amistad, que jamás debería estar construida sobre las cenizas de una relación personal más intensa.

Lo que debería sustituir a una relación no es la amistad, sino algo mucho más honesto: una distancia cordial. Eso y la seguridad de que la relación, sus mejores momentos más bien, vivirán eternamente en el único lugar que puede ocupar sin peligro: la memoria.

There's nothing quite like the winter romance of mountains and the movies.

The joys of this breathtaking and passionate affair is best summed up at the annual Dharamsala International Film Festival, now in its 6th edition.

Monks, both young and old, dressed in soothing red robes, people the vibrant town, strolling across its long-winding streets. Clad stylishly in what appear Ray Bans, red sneakers, and black backpacks, they make for quite a sight.

Tourists, both local and foreign, walk the streets with the restless enthusiasm only wanderlust can inspire. At the central square is where the cinephiles gather, exchanging notes about what to watch and what to skip, and where to find the most delicious Momos (it's at the Tibet Kitchen btw, a lovely restaurant just around the corner of the square).

Assembled under trying circumstances and functioning with modest resources, DIFF opened Thursday evening at the Tibetan Children's Village (TCV) near the Dal lake, about 10 minutes away from Dharamsala's main town, McLeod Ganj.

Free from the tempting vanities that the Mumbai Film Festival seductively pulls off, Dharamsala Film Festival, like the actor Adil Hussain said, is a great festival because 'there is no red carpet.'

Hussain, a naturally gifted actor, who sprung up on the scene with his layered performance in Gauri Shinde's much-celebrated English Vinglish, was present at the opening ceremony as his film, Mukti Bhavan (Hotel Salvation is its international title), opened the festival.

Hotel Salvation, which translates to 'deliverance from harm', is an uniquely inspiring choice of film for a festival set in Dharamsala, a place that's largely populated by Tibetans who escaped home due to a brutal Chinese oppression in search of a safe place. The festival founders, Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, are vocal critics of the Chinese occupation of Tibet and its systematic cleansing of Tibetan culture.

In that context, Hotel Salvation is also a very political choice as opening film, even if it's incidental and not deliberate.

The film has been often cited as the best film of the year. At least that was the case until Amit Masurkar's Newton came along.

Directed by debutant Shubhashish Bhutiani, who was only 23 when he pitched the idea to Hussain, Mukti Bhavan is a hauntingly beautiful portrait of life and death and of troubled parent-offspring relationships.

As Hussain's character, Rajiv, takes his father to the titular hotel, where the elderly come to peacefully transition into the realm of the unknown, the film very subtly nudges one into examining our own attitudes towards mortality, parents as well as how their upbringing influences the way we end up treating our children. Incidentally, this was also one of the underlying themes in Titli.

Adil Hussain at the 6th Dharamsala International Film Festival.

Hussain and Behl have a fractured father-son relationship and it's this very complexity that Bhutiani explores with nuance and subtlety.

On the deathbed, can you get yourself to despise your father, or even love him fully, for the decisions that dramatically altered the course of your life? Hate, bitterness, distance are all components of the larger sentiment of love which overpowers most feelings in Hotel Salvation's morbid yet deeply funny universe.

The film has a terrific ensemble, led by Hussain and supported ably by Lalit Behl (who played the quietly sinister patriarch in Kanu Behl's Titli), Palomi Ghosh, Geetanjali Kulkarni, and Navnidra Behl.

Hussain spoke about how he drew out this part from his personal experience of having had a troubled relationship with his father, who wanted him to become a professor of English and not an actor. It was only in the last two years of his late father's life did he come around to approving his career choice, after watching an interview of his on the BBC.

About his performance, Hussain said, ""I have learnt to be responsive and not reactive. I tend to internalise and hold back my emotions. Whatever seeps out is the performance you see on-screen.""

Incidentally, Hussain's acting mentor, the legendary Barry John, was in the audience. About the film, Barry said, ""A film like Mukti Bhavan is so moving and one is at a loss for words. There are so many emotions one experiences that one doesn't know how to cope with it.""

It couldn't have been summed up in a better way.

The festival will continue until the weekend, where Rima Das' MAMI-favorite, Village Rockstars, plays as the closing film.

Among other films to be screened at the 4-day long festival include India's Oscar-entry Newton, Konkona Sen Sharma's A Death in the Gunj, and Rahul Jain's, Machines.

Jenny Lewis fotografiert Mütter mit ihren ein Tage alten Babies

Sie ist selbst Mutter und will anderen zeigen, dass sie keine Angst vor der Geburt haben müssen

Die Bilder zeigen allesamt starke, glückliche Mütter, denen die unbändige Liebe für ihr Kind deutlich anzusehen ist

Der Geburt eines Babys ist einer der prägendsten Momente im Leben einer Frau. Viele werdende Mütter begleitet in den Wochen davor neben all der Vorfreude auch ein ängstliches Gefühl.

Die Fotografin Jenny Lewis will ihren Teil dazu beitragen, dass die schönen Gefühle überwiegen. Mit einem Fotoprojekt One Day Young will sie schwangeren Frauen zeigen, dass eine Geburt nichts ist, vor dem man Angst haben muss.

Die Bilderstrecke zeigt verschiedene Mütter mit ihren Neugeborenen. Die Fotos sind alle am Tag nach der Geburt aufgenommen.

“Als ich Mutter wurde, hatte ich das Gefühl, dass ich anderen schwangeren Frauen sagen muss 'Alles wird gut!'"", sagte Lewis der HuffPost UK. Sie selbst ist Mutter von zwei Kindern. Ruby ist acht Jahre alt und Herb sechs.

Das Buch über eine Hebamme änderte alles

""Oft hört man von all den furchtbaren Dinge, die bei der Geburt schief gehen können. Bevor ich mein erstes Kind bekam, habe ich nicht eine positive Sache gehört"", beschreibt die Mutter ihre damalige Situation.

""Ich dachte, alles dreht sich nur um Periduralanästhesien und Krankenhäuser. Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich es genießen könnte, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

Helen und Hudson

Das änderte sich, als eine Freundin ihr ein Buch über die Hebamme Ina May Gaskin zeigte. ""Das Buch beinhaltet Kurzgeschichten über die Frauen, die sie betreut hat"", sagte Lewis.

“Diesen Frauen ging es gut. Sie haben die Wehen überstanden und ihre Ängste überwunden. Plötzlich habe ich gemerkt, wie sich meine Gedanken änderten und was es wirklich bedeutete, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 30 Fotos zeigen, dass Hebammen die Welt zu einem besseren Ort machen

""Nur wenige sagen 'Weißt du was? Ich habe die Geburt tatsächlich genossen. Es hat mir Selbstbewusstsein gegeben. Das war das schönste Gefühl, das ich jemals hatte'"", sagte Lewis. Dabei gebe es viele Frauen, die genau diese Empfindung hätten - sie zum Beispiel.

Jenny und Suki

""Das soll keineswegs die Erfahrungen von Frauen klein machen, die eine schwere Geburt hatten. Aber es muss Stimmen von beiden Seiten geben"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Ich wollte Teil von der anderen Seite sein - ein Teil einer Geschichte, über die andere vielleicht auch stolpern, so wie es mir mit Ina May passiert ist. Eine Geschichte, die die Balance zwischen den Seiten herstellt und Frauen vielleicht auch ein bisschen die Angst nimmt.""

""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte""

Mit ihren Fotos habe sie den den Moment nach der Geburt festhalten wollen - und zeigen, dass die Frauen danach immer noch sie selbst sind. ""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte.""

""One Day Young"" war geboren.

Alle Frauen, die auf den Bildern zu sehen sind, haben sich auf Lewis' Facebook-Aufruf gemeldet.

Einige kontaktierten die Fotografin auch, nachdem sie ihre Flyer in kleinen Läden und an Laternen gesehen hatten.



Laure und Tyrick

“Schon nach den ersten paar Shootings war mir klar: Das ist etwas wirklich Besonders”, sagte Lewis. ""Die Atmosphäre war so wundervoll.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Mutter zeigt auf einem Foto, wie sie nach der Geburt aussieht - für viele Frauen ist das noch immer ein Tabu

In den ersten 24 Stunden nach der Geburt beobachte sie eine ganz besondere Energie zwischen Mutter und Kind. Die Frauen hätten alle ganz leuchtende Augen gehabt. ""Ich wollte diesen Moment einfangen - bevor die täglichen Sorgen zurück zu ihnen finden. Es ist eine große Ehre, als Fotografin die Möglichkeit haben zu dürfen, das festzuhalten.""



Liana und Archer

Die Fotos der Bilderreihe zeigen Mütter ganz unterschiedlicher Herkunft und verschiedenen Alters. Aber sie haben alle eines gemeinsam: ihre unglaubliche Stärke.

Jedes Bild ist eine Geschichte

“In diesen ersten 24 Stunden kommt die innere Kriegerin der Frauen zum Vorschein. Sie bekommen diese Kraft, um ihr Kind zu beschützen und das sieht man auch auf den Bildern"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Sie sind wie diese heldenhaften Bilder von Soldaten auf dem Schlachtfeld oder ein Fußballspieler nach dem gewonnenen Spiel, noch voller Adrenalin. Dieser Moment wird selten festgehalten. Aber das, was sie erreicht haben, ist mindestens genau so wichtig wie das Tor oder der gewonnen Kampf - und dieser Moment verdient es, in einer Arena aufgenommen und gefeiert zu werden.""



Xanthe und Louie

Für sie ist jede Frau auf jedem Bild einzigartig - und doch verbindet sie etwas. ""Jeder hat seine Probleme, aber in diesem Moment werden sie unwichtig und jede ist gleich - auf einer Augenhöhe. Es ist egal, ob ich die Frauen in einer Villa oder in einem Hostel fotografiere. Der Blick in den Augen der Frauen ist immer der gleiche: Sie sind stolz auf sich selbst.""

L'UE s'indigne, le gouvernement silencieux

Dans l'attente de nouvelles révélations qui pourraient impliquer des entreprises et des personnalités françaises, le gouvernement n'a toujours pas réagi ce lundi aux pratiques mises au jour par l'ICIJ. La Commission européenne et les ministres des Finances de l'UE ont toutefois promis d'accroître leur lutte contre l'évasion fiscale.

""Ce nouveau scandale montre, une fois encore, que certaines entreprises et particuliers fortunés sont prêts à tout pour ne pas payer d'impôts. Les citoyens européens ne le supportent plus. Et ils ont raison: c'est insupportable!"", a déclaré le commissaire européen à la Fiscalité Pierre Moscovici, en arrivant à une réunion des ministres des Finances de l'UE à Bruxelles.

""A la lumière de ces nouvelles révélations choquantes"", Pierre Moscovici a appelé les Etats membres de l'UE à ""adopter rapidement la liste des paradis fiscaux, assortie de sanctions dissuasives, ainsi qu'une législation européenne encadrant les intermédiaires fiscaux"". ""C'est moralement indispensable et politiquement urgent"", a-t-il dit.

Le Front national accuse au contraire l'Union européenne d'encourager l'évasion fiscale ""en Irlande, aux Pays-Bas, à Malte"".

The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.
“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.
“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.","And the risk of them subsequently developing the anxiety disorder PTSD is particularly high if the child’s family is facing poverty, unemployment or housing issues.

But actually more than two thirds of children in the UK are likely to have experienced a traumatic event by the age of 16, according to chartered clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan, who helped to write the guide for social workers looking after the families affected by the Grenfell Tower fire .

Often associated with veterans returning from war zones, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may not seem like something that might affect a child.

Like adults, all children will have different reactions to a traumatic event, and how they react may depend on a combination of their age, personality and previous life experience.

But children are unlikely to know that they are suffering, and so will require parents to help them understand what they are going through.

Why might a child suffer from PTSD?

The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.

In fact one in three teenagers who survives a serious car crash and 40% of people who have lost a loved one suddenly will experience PTSD.

According to PTSD UK the defining characteristic of a traumatic event is whether or not it has the “capacity to provoke fear, helplessness, or horror in response to the threat of injury or death” so consider the event in those terms.

Young people are just as vulnerable to these triggers as adults.

“PTSD can occur after directly or indirectly experiencing a traumatic event that puts you or someone close to you at risk of serious harm or death,” said Dr Rosan, programme lead at the Mental Health Foundation.

“This can be anything from a road accident, to experiencing or witnessing violence or human accidents.”

What are the signs of PTSD in a child?

As with adults, the way children react to a trauma is likely to be individual to them as a person, but there are some tell-tale symptoms of PTSD that parents can be alert to.

Dr Rosan advised that it is likely children, who are older than toddlers, will experience a physical response, with symptoms such as an increased heart rate, sweating, rapid breathing and changes in appetite.

Your child might also become preoccupied with thoughts or images of the event or start experiencing nightmares and worrying that it will happen again.

“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.

“A sudden onset of intense emotions is also to be expected – such as fearfulness, increased anxiety, anger or irritability.”

For younger children, physical symptoms might not be reported in these terms and instead they might tell you they have a headache or stomach ache.

“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.

“Regressive behaviours are common, such as a resurgence of bedwetting or thumb-sucking.”

This ​​​​psychological reaction, notes NBC News, is known as the ""mere exposure effect,"" according to music psychology researcher Dr. Victoria Williamson, who conducts research on the psychology of music at Goldsmiths, University of London.

According to Williamson, there's a U-shaped relationship between the amount of times we hear music that we like and our reaction to it. The first few times you hear your favourite Christmas songs you actually do feel festive, but once you hear those same tunes too many times, it becomes maddening.

""Anyone who has worked in a Christmas store over the holidays will know what I'm talking about,"" Williamson told NBC News. But this reaction can depend on our psychological states, she noted, as some people like, or can tolerate, the bombardment of Christmas music, while other people feel like they're ""going crazy.""

For the latter folks, we don't have any good news for you because Christmas music — in stores, at least — is here to stay. And this is because it encourages customers to buy things.

Research has shown that the right balance of Christmas scents and songs can make shoppers feel more positive about their current environment, which makes them want to shop more.

""We've shown that 'holiday appropriate' music combined with congruent 'holiday scents' can influence shoppers by increasing the amount of time they spend in a store, their intention to revisit it, and intention to purchase,"" noted Eric Spangenberg, PhD, Dean of the College of Business at Washington State University.

In a 2012 interview with HuffPost, music therapist Jennifer Buchanan noted that music can actually make people feel good about themselves, which may explain why some people shop more when they hear festive music.

Die Sexismus-Debatte wirft viele komplexe Fragen auf

Eine der drängendsten: Was ist der Grund, dass sexuelle Belästigung überhaupt noch so weit verbreitet ist?

Ein Sozialpsychologe erklärt, was er für die Hauptursache hält

Wie kommt es, dass Sexismus in unserer Gesellschaft noch immer so weit verbreitet ist? Was bringt Männer dazu, Frauen zu belästigen und ihnen im schlimmsten Fall sogar sexuelle Gewalt anzutun? Und was muss geschehen, dass sich etwas ändert?

Was als Hollywood-Skandal um den Produzenten Harvey Weinstein begann, hat sich schnell zu einer mächtigen und sehr emotional geführten Sexismus-Debatte entwickelt, die viele Fragen aufwirft.

Die meisten davon sind alles andere als einfach zu beantworten. Der Sozialpsychologe Rolf Pohl ist deshalb der Ansicht: Um die Kultur zwischen Männern und Frauen zu ändern, müssen wir zunächst verstehen, was der Auslöser der Diskriminierung ist.

Psychologisches Dilemma für viele Männer

""Es wird zu wenig über die Motivation hinter Sexismus und sexueller Belästigung gesprochen"", sagte er dem Nachrichten-Webseite ""Stern"". ""Einerseits sollen Männer autonom sein, andererseits sind sie sexuell abhängig von Frauen.""

Viele Männer seien so in einer psychologisch vertrackten Situation.

Bei dem Männlichkeitsbild unserer Gesellschaft spiele Macht noch immer eine große Rolle. ""Die Botschaft lautet: Ich brauche Frischfleisch in Serie, weil ich so potent bin und das allen zeigen will"", sagte Pohl.

""Sie drücken damit aus, dass sie Frauen brauchen. Um das zu überspielen, machen die Männer Frauen zum Objekt und lassen sie das auch spüren: in Form von Anmache, Grapschen, bis zur Vergewaltigung.""

Frauenfeindliche Strukturen

Die Folge: ""Diese Männer machen Frauen dafür verantwortlich, dass sie ihr Begehren ausgelöst haben, dass sie von ihnen abhängig sind.""

Dieses Dilemma, so erklärt der Psychologe, sei eine der wichtigen Ursachen von Gewalt gegenüber Frauen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass die Gesellschaft in Deutschland nach wie vor frauenfeindlich sei.

""Wir leben in einer Gesellschaft mit männlicher Vorherrschaft, Frauenfeindlichkeit ist eine Folge davon"", sagte er dem ""Stern"". Daran änderten auch eine Bundeskanzlerin oder einzelne Frauen in Führungspositionen nichts.

Tatsächlich: Zwölf Jahre Merkel-Kanzlerschaft haben so gut wie nichts an der Gleichstellung der Frauen in Deutschland verändert, das zeigen ernüchternde Zahlen.

Bei den Gehältern von Frauen schneidet Deutschland im internationalen Vergleich bemerkenswert schlecht ab. Im Schnitt verdienen weibliche Angestellte immer noch 21 Prozent weniger als Männer in derselben Position. Im OECD-Durchschnitt liegt der Gender-Pay-Gap bei knapp 17 Prozent. Grund dafür ist auch, dass überdurchschnittlich viele Frauen in Deutschland in Teilzeit arbeiten.

""Wir sind bei der Gleichberechtigung noch nicht so weit, wie wir glauben""

In den Vorständen der börsennotierten Unternehmen in Deutschland liegt der Anteil der Männer laut einer Studie der Allbright Stiftung bei 93 Prozent. Auch im Mittelstand herrscht bei den Führungskräften eklatanter Frauenmangel. Nur vier Prozent der Chefs dort sind weiblich.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sexismus-Debatte: Kein Satz von Ivanka Trump war bisher so voller Hohn wie dieser - und das will etwas heißen

Für Pohl gibt es zwischen diesen Zahlen und dem Sexismus-Problem einen direkten Zusammenhang. Diskriminierung von Frauen sei nicht, wie es oft heißt, ein Relikt aus vergangener Zeit, das einige wenige alte Männer betreffe.

""Sexuelle Belästigung hat eben nichts Archaisches, sondern findet überall statt, wo Führungsebenen männlich dominiert sind"", sagte der Psychologe. ""Wir sind bei der Gleichberechtigung noch nicht so weit, wie wir glauben.""

All'occupazione della fabbrica seguito un corteo, che ha sfilato nella zona di Cornigliano, dov'è situato lo stabilimento. Ad aprire la marcia degli operai gli striscioni con la scritta ""Pacta sunt servanda"" e ""Fabbrica occupata"".

Il ministero dello Sviluppo economico, che ha da poco riaperto il tavolo con la nuova proprietà, ha reagito alla mobilitazione con una nota: ""Una simile iniziativa rischia di mettere a rischio la trattativa"". Il fatto che la Fiom abbia promosso ""fuori da ogni regola l'interruzione delle attività mentre il confronto tra le parti si è finalmente avviato"" desta, sostiene il ministero, ""stupore e sconcerto"". Da parte del Mise, poi, l'impegno a vegliare affinché ""il negoziato si concluda con il consenso di tutte le parti"".

""Non capisco di cosa si stupisca il ministero dello Sviluppo economico. Sono settimane che chiediamo un incontro sull'accordo di programma e la reazione alla mancata convocazione di questo tavolo con tutti i firmatari non può che essere lo sciopero e la lotta"", ha sostenuto Bruno Manganaro, il segretario genovese della Fiom, che poche ore prima aveva invitato tutti i cittadini ad andare a trovare gli operai davanti alla tenda rossa che stavano per montare vicino allo stabilimento. ""Poi il Mise dovrebbe sapere che il fatto che la trattativa nazionale possa saltare sarebbe una buona notizia per moltissimi lavoratori Ilva che non condividono questo percorso pieno di rischi e incertezze"", ha aggiunto Manganaro.

La protesta andrà avanti almeno fino all'8 novembre, in attesa dell'esito dell'incontro tra istituzioni e ministro Calenda al Mise.

La protesta, spiega la Fiom, è dovuta al fatto che la trattativa non tiene conto dell'accordo di programma del 2005, nel quale non venivano previsti esuberi. Nel piano della nuova proprietà, invece, sono previsti 600 esuberi. Una cifra importante, se si considera che i lavoratori attuali nello stabilimento di Genova sono 1500. A livello nazionale, invece, gli esuberi sarebbero circa 4000.

Gli altri sindacati avevano preso le distanze dalla Cgil genovese, in attesa degli sviluppi della trattativa nazionale. La rappresentanza sindacale della fabbrica, però, ha scelto la linea dura.

""È l'inizio di una lunga settimana. Rivendichiamo l'accordo di programma, chiediamo un tavolo per Genova - ha detto Manganaro all'AdnKronos - Ci devono convocare, noi l'accordo di programma ce l'abbiamo, è giuridicamente valido e non ce lo possono scippare"".

Per il segretario generale della Uilm di Genova, Antonio Apa, l'occupazione è un ""atto inconsulto"". Per il sindacalista, infatti: ""Una minoranza di lavoratori si è sostituita alla maggioranza dell'insieme dei dipendenti (alla faccia della democrazia) attraverso un atto intollerante, che non rappresenta un bel biglietto da visita nei confronti di Mittal e del Governo, rispetto alla trattativa in corso né un favore ai lavoratori"".

Da parte della Fiom nazionale arriva la solidarietà ai lavoratori dell'Ilva: ""L'iniziativa dei lavoratori di Genova non è isolata. I lavoratori sono gli unici che possono isolare la Fiom, ma con la mobilitazione di oggi dimostrano esattamente il contrario"" - hanno scritto in una nota Francesca Re David, segretario generale della Fiom e Rosario Rappa, segretario nazionale del sindacato dei metalmeccanici - La vertenza per la cessione del Gruppo Ilva non è un fatto tecnico tra governo, azienda e sindacati è un confronto da cui dipendono occupazione, produzione industriale e risanamento ambientale"".","Occupato lo stabilimento Ilva di Genova.

In recent days the New York Police Department has declared that they are investigating claims of rape against the producer.

The allegations against Weinstein have also spurred on fresh claims against other Hollywood figures, such as director James Toback, and 'House of Cards' actor Kevin Spacey.

Was das mit Kaffeekapseln zu tun hat, erklärt der Soziologe Stephan Lessenich

Es ist leicht, es ist bequem - und George Clooney macht es auch: der Kaffee aus der Kapsel.

20.600 Tonnen der Kapseln haben die Deutschen 2015 verbraucht. Zehn Jahre zuvor waren es gerade einmal 800 Tonnen. Ein sprunghafter Anstieg.

Dabei gelten die kleinen Kapseln schon länger als wahre Umweltsünder. Das Verhältnis von Inhalt zu Verpackung ist völlig unverhältnismäßig - und das Material, Aluminium, ist häufig umweltschädlich.

Das Ergebnis: 5000 Tonnen Abfall an Aluminium. Wem diese Zahl zu abstrakt ist, der kann sich auch dieses Foto ansehen. Es macht deutlich, welche Schäden ein scheinbar harmloser Genuss wie Kaffeetrinken anrichten kann:

Die Aufnahme zeigt das brasilianische Dorf Bento Rodrigues. Am 5. November 2015 kamen hier 19 Menschen ums Leben, sie wurden von einer Schlammlawine überrollt.

Und neben uns die Sintflut

Ursache war ein Dammbruch im Rückhaltebecken der Eisenerzmine Samarco in der brasilianischen Bergbaustadt Mariana. Durchsetzt mit Schwermetallen überzog eine giftige Schicht von Schlamm das Tal. Die Wasserversorgung für Millionen von Menschen ist seitdem gefährdet.

Schlamm und Tote hier, unschuldiger Kaffeekonsum dort - beides hänge zusammen, erklärt der Soziologe Stephan Lessenich in seinem Buch ""Neben uns die Sintflut"", über das er am Sonntag im Deutschlandfunk sprach.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wie ein Brasilianer seit 40 Jahren Baum für Baum den Regenwald rettet

Am Beispiel des Dammbruchs in Brasilien versucht Lessenich, die Zusammenhänge von Konsum und Ausbeutung der Natur verständlich zu machen.

Kaffeekonsum und die Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen

Für Lessenich dient Samarco als Beispiel für den Rohstoffhunger des Westens in Brasilien. Das Bergbauunternehmen Rio Tinto, das einen Anteil an der Mine hält, hat seine Eisenerzförderung zwischen 2006 und 2014 drastisch gesteigert. Sicherheitsmängel im Rückhaltebecken der Mine seien ignoriert worden, schreibt Lessenich in seinem Buch.

Rio Tinto steigerte auch seine Förderung von Bauxit drastisch. Dieses Erz wiederum dient der Herstellung von Aluminium. Und Aluminium steckt dann etwa auch in den kleinen, fein portionierten und leicht verwendbaren Kaffeekapseln, die in den vergangenen Jahre immer beliebter wurde.

""Da kann man sehen, dass es da bestimmte Verbindungen gibt"", sagte Lessenich im Deutschlandfunk. ""Also der lockerleichte, nebenher betriebene Kaffeekonsum hierzulande und die Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen von vielen, vielen Menschen anderswo in der Welt.""

In der Regel würden die Verbindungen nicht so klar hervortreten. Im Fall des Dammbruchs mit seinen 19 Toten aber bleibe die Verbindung von Rohstoffhunger und die “Zerstörung von Lebensgrundlagen” nicht verborgen. In der Tat: Sie ist auf den Fotos überdeutlich.

Mit dem Beispiel will Lessenich zeigen, wie sehr kleine Entscheidungen im Alltag größere Folgen nach sich ziehen können - und wie kompliziert das mit dem Konsum in einer modernen, globalisierten Welt geworden ist.

Wenn jede Entscheidung plötzlich zählt

""Konsum ist Politik mit dem Einkaufswagen"", kommentierte kürzlich die Wochenzeitung ""Die Zeit"" die Verwirrung, die verantwortungsvolle Käufer zwangsläufig überkommt. Wie wahr dieser Satz ist. Der Fortbestand des Regenwalds entscheidet sich eben auch an der heimischen Kaffeemaschine.

Jede Entscheidung will gut überlegt sein, jede Kaufentscheidung kann einen ganzen Rattenschwanz von Folgen mit sich bringen. Manchmal gute, manchmal schlechte, manchmal verheerende.

Im Falle der Kaffeekapseln gibt es allerdings auch mehrere mögliche Lösungen, um den Schaden für die Umwelt zu begrenzen. Man steigt um auf Filterkaffee - oder man gewöhnt sich einen Handgriff an: Man wirft die Kapseln zumindest in den gelben Sack. Nespresso etwa, der größte Hersteller von Kaffeekapseln, bemüht sich darum, das Recyceln so leicht wie möglich zu machen.

Wie viele Kaffeetrinker die Kapseln dort reinwerfen, weiß der Hersteller nicht. Es ist eine Entscheidung, die jedem selbst überlassen bleibt.

Aber auch eine, die Folgen am anderen Ende der Welt haben kann.

Les réseaux sociaux ont largement contribué à cette libération.

Parler

Des milliers d'entre nous, passant par les hashtags #balancetonporc ou #metoo, ont révélé ce qu'elles gardaient pour elles par gêne, par honte, par peur, ou par l'effet d'une culpabilité inversée. Certaines, encore peu nombreuses, ont déposé plainte, donnant le nom de leurs agresseurs.

Espérons qu'il ne s'agit pas là seulement d'un élan circonstanciel, appelé à retomber, avant un retour à la case départ. Nous avons besoin de cette libération. Elle est peut-être plus nécessaire que l'allongement des délais de prescription que nombre d'entre nous réclament, quand peu de plaintes aboutissent hélas à la condamnation effective des responsables. Nous savons en effet que plus le temps est long entre l'agression et la procédure, moins les plaignantes ont des chances de faire reconnaître le tort qui leur a été fait. Une grande frustration s'ajoutant alors au préjudice initial.

Si nous ne nous emparons pas de la parole dans la durée, nous n'avancerons pas. Certes, le traumatisme engendré par la violence sexuelle tarde souvent à émerger. Mais la parole n'en est pas moins le seul outil à notre disposition pour nous en sortir et pour protéger celles qui, demain, risquent à leur tour d'être victimes de ces violences. Parler, c'est commencer à agir.

Agir

Education dès le plus jeune âge pour détecter l'agresseur, lui tenir tête, parler à ses proches de l'agression subie; formation des policiers, des gendarmes, des magistrats, des médecins, des enseignants sur ces problèmes trop souvent banalisés ou minorés, une formation visant à aiguiser leur écoute, sans jugement préalable; création de cellules d'écoute dans les entreprises, les institutions, les partis, les associations, au Parlement, dans les cabinets ministériels, etc., tout cela se révèle indispensable compte tenu de l'ampleur du fléau, que la parole libérée a révélée.

Les communes, elles non plus, ne peuvent plus se dispenser de prendre leur part dans ce travail, les mairies doivent mettre en place des spots où des personnes averties accueilleront les femmes concernées et les aideront à porter plainte. Pour tout cela, il faudra des fonds, une action continue des pouvoirs publics, y compris de grandes campagnes d'information, et le gouvernement ne pourra plus se contenter des bonnes paroles et d'un ""secrétariat d'État chargée de l'égalité entre les femmes et les hommes"" réduit à la portion congrue.

Tout ne changera pas du jour au lendemain. Ce mal a une histoire, qui remonte à loin, il ne disparaîtra pas dans le court terme. Dans ce combat, la libération de la parole n'est qu'une étape.

Si la femme continue d'être exhibée comme un argument de vente pour écouler vêtements, bijoux, voitures ou produits de luxe, elle ne cessera pas d'être perçue elle-même comme un objet de consommation et comme un objet sexuel. Sans oublier la pornographie, bien sûr, et ses effets délétères. Si nous ne nous attaquons pas à ces marqueurs qui façonnent les mentalités de beaucoup d'hommes, la libération de la parole des femmes – qui n'a pas le droit à l'erreur dans la désignation de leurs agresseurs si elle veut garder quelque poids –, cette libération, dis-je, n'ira pas loin. Elle restera vaine.

Les femmes ne sont pas (seulement) des victimes

Il ne faudrait pas non plus que nous, les femmes, nous nous érigions seulement en victimes. Des victimes à plaindre. Voilà qui pourrait arranger tous ceux qui continuent à nous tenir pour des êtres fragiles, à qui il suffirait de prodiguer un peu de compassion pour se faire pardonner. Il faut aller plus loin, exiger plus.

Nous voulons simplement occuper la place qui nous revient. La parité, oui. Mais la parité dans les faits. La prise en compte de nos acquis, de nos ambitions, de notre savoir-faire, de notre savoir-dire, avec des postes et des salaires égaux à ceux des hommes à même niveau de compétence. Cette parité-là a de toute évidence besoin d'un coup de pouce. Sur le papier, c'est facile, sur le terrain social, c'est autre chose.

Encore aujourd'hui, la parole des femmes peine à se faire entendre y compris par exemple au Parlement, dans les commissions, en séance. Cette parole, il faut souvent l'arracher. Celles qui veulent parler, et elles ne sont pas nombreuses, sont obligées de jouer des coudes. Dès que nous ouvrons la bouche, jusque dans l'hémicycle, les hommes se mettent à bavarder, à chahuter comme dans une cour de récréation, ils nous coupent la parole, raillent notre tenue, lancent des remarques déplacées, ou simplement ne nous écoutent pas, et je dirai même, ne nous entendent pas. Et si nous élevons la voix, nous sommes bien sûr jugées agressives. Dans les institutions, dans les partis, dans l'entreprise, à l'Université, ce n'est guère mieux.

Là où il y a de la parole, il y a du pouvoir, et les hommes dominent ""naturellement"". Ce sont toujours les mêmes qui font de longs discours pour dire souvent si peu. Il n'y a pas de place, pas de temps pour la parole des femmes. Cette même parole qui longtemps s'est tue face au harcèlement, à l'agression sexuelle ou au viol. Oui, la parole, c'est le pouvoir. Et les femmes n'ont pas à la prendre seulement pour dénoncer. Notre parole ne doit en aucun cas être réduite à une parole de victimes.

L'""inclusion"" ne se décrète pas, elle s'arrache

À la télévision, les femmes sont nombreuses pour présenter les informations. Mais regardez plutôt les débats. Elles y sont si rares. La parole pensante et débattante est l'apanage des hommes. Nous ne serions pas, semble-t-il, aussi expertes qu'eux. Seraient-elles donc si rares, les femmes à avoir fait de longues études? Le retour sans fin sur les plateaux des mêmes hâbleurs masculins n'aide pas les femmes à figurer en nombre au haut des répertoires téléphoniques des puissances invitantes. À la radio, ce n'est guère différent. Parler de choses sérieuses reste une affaire d'hommes. Lorsqu'une femme est conviée à participer au débat, il lui faut déployer bien des efforts pour ne pas être coupée par les hommes. Et même lorsque c'est une femme qui anime les échanges, par automatisme, elle laissera souvent les hommes – eux d'abord – parler tout leur soûl.

Bref, nous voulons notre temps de parole. Et plus que cela. Aucune orthographe inclusive, aucune féminisation des noms de métiers n'y suffiront. De telles initiatives peuvent rappeler aux oublieux qu'il y a 50% de femmes au monde et qu'elles méritent un autre traitement que celui qu'on leur réserve. Mais ces mesures, à elles seules, ne suffiront pas à faire reconnaître les femmes pour ce qu'elles sont: des êtres libres et autonomes. La fêlure est bien plus importante. Et nous avons à la réparer ensemble, femmes et hommes. Ce n'est ni la censure au nom du féminisme, ni les petits bricolages autour des droits des femmes, ni un statut de victime dans lequel nous nous draperions, qui libéreront les hommes de leurs préjugés et nous épargneront leurs dérives.

S'il y a un temps pour révéler et pour soigner les plaies, ce temps ne saurait faire oublier que nous sommes encore loin de notre but, qui est d'assumer pleinement, sans complexes, avec toute l'énergie dont nous sommes capables, et sans que cela enlève rien à notre féminité intrinsèque, notre rôle de sujets pensants et agissants.

Personne ne nous fera ce cadeau, sinon nous-mêmes.

Preferendo, a quest'ultimo, il candidato del Movimento 5 Stelle Giancarlo Cancelleri. In altre parole, il voto ""utile"" e disgiunto si è riversato sull'esponente grillino, tutto a danno del candidato della coalizione targata Partito Democratico. In numeri, stando alle ultime proiezioni tanto di Emg/La7 quanto Piepoli/Rai, su una copertura del 40% circa (e margine d'errore del 2,8%), Micari risulta aver preso quasi l'8% in meno come candidato rispetto alla somma dei voti presi dai partiti che lo hanno sostenuto.

La coalizione Micari Presidente ha quindi ottenuto, secondo i dati provvisori ma in via di consolidamento, circa il 26,1% mentre i consensi andati al rettore di Palermo come presidente della Regione si fermano intorno al 18%. Dove sono finiti questi voti? A naso, tutti o quasi su Cancelleri che ha ottenuto il 36% circa dei voti mentre la sua lista Movimento 5 Stelle si è fermata al 28,8%.

Il voto disgiunto è una pratica che spesso emerge nelle elezioni che prevedono un secondo turno, il cosiddetto ballottaggio. La tendenza stavolta assume un peso già rilevante perché avviene in una elezione aperta a più candidati e senza ballottaggio. È quindi sintomo di diversi fattori. In primis: gli elettori della coalizione del centrosinistra hanno percepito la sfida per la Regione come una corsa a due in via esclusiva: da una parte il candidato del centrodestra Nello Musumeci, dall'altro il grillino Cancelleri. Non solo: è evidente che i sostenitori di centrosinistra non hanno riconosciuto nel rettore di Palermo Micari una candidatura forte in grado di avere un quid spendibile nella corsa per Palazzo d'Orleans. No chance. E allora tanto vale orientarsi sul candidato grillino per arginare la destra.

Ancora: la coalizione di centrodestra ha dimostrato che quando c'è un accordo su un nome unitario, i partiti coalizzati fanno la loro parte senza défaillance: Musumeci si avvia alla presidenza della Regione Sicilia con il 38% delle preferenze, mentre la coalizione che lo ha sostenuto orbita intorno al 37,4%. Detta ancora diversamente, nessuno ha fatto mancare i suoi voti. Stesso discorso, ma su numeri ridotti, per Claudio Fava (7%) in linea con le preferenze raccolte dalla sua lista, i Cento Passi (7,1%).

Il voto disgiunto penalizza quindi il Partito Democratico e il suo candidato. Non a caso, Davide Faraone, sottosegretario alla Salute ma pure uomo forte dei dem in Sicilia, ha sottolineato come sia ""un dato inquietante: se avessimo avuto una coalizione unita probabilmente questa polarizzazione non sarebbe avvenuta"". Al momento, pare di capire, la lettura che viene data dai dem sul voto disgiunto attribuisce alla doppia candidatura presentata dalla sinistra, quella di Micari (sostenuto anche da Angelino Alfano) e quella di Fava (sostenuto da Mdp, Sinistra Italiana e Possibile), la responsabilità del cattivo risultato del rettore palermitano.

Voto ""utile"" ma alla fine ""inutile"", dal momento che il supporto arrivato dagli elettori di centrosinistra al candidato del Movimento 5 Stelle non è riuscito a farlo prevalere su Musumeci. Magra consolazione per il candidato del Pd.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU -- Demand for physical gold was lacklustre in top consumers India and China this week, while the lure of the metal remained stable in Singapore, but India's peak wedding season is expected to usher in renewed interest for bullion in coming weeks.

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

""The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,"" said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

""Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That's why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,"" said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday's mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks. [GOL/]

""Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,"" said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

""Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,"" said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

""There has been interest from two segments, the wholesalers and high net worth individuals, so it is still strong,"" said Loh Mun Chun, Director, Private Wealth at GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

""The wholesalers need to buy ... to produce jewellery, especially with some spillover demand coming from the Diwali and Dhanterras festivals, while the high net worth individuals ... buy to diversify their portfolio and they have the money.""

Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday on Friday.

The story:

I was never overweight or obese growing up, however I remember struggling with my weight and body image from a very young age.

The weight gain really started in university. I was away from home, suffering terribly from depression, and binge drinking socially with my friends every week.

Over the years I would always try the latest ""fad"" diet: diet pills, cleanses, and low calorie diets. None of these worked, of course, because they're unrealistic and not maintainable long term.

The final straw:

After leaving my final year of university due to a health scare, combined with debilitating depression and anxiety, I was desperate for change. So I decided that I would start by working to change my physical body, with the hope that eventually my mental health would improve as well.

The plan of attack:

I started using a program called ""Bikini Body Guide,"" a guide comprised of workouts that can all be done at home using minimal equipment. I downloaded a food tracking app and started tracking what I was eating. In the first year I lost 30 pounds and it took me two years in total to lose the 65 pounds.

Why I share my story on social media:

I wanted to show other people, particularly women, that you can hit rock bottom physically/mentally/emotionally, and bounce back. I wanted a place to talk about physical and mental health.

I was inspired by Kayla Itsines and other ""BBG girls"" (women who were doing the program that I eventually started). I saw so many women sharing their stories and journeys publicly, and I felt encouraged to do the same.

I wanted to show other people, particularly women, that you can hit rock bottom physically/mentally/emotionally, and bounce back.

The hardest adjustment:

Learning self-discipline was quite difficult for me in the beginning. I had to learn to hold myself accountable for what I was eating and how often I was training. There was no one that was going to hold me accountable other than me, and that was a scary thought.

The food element:

I gradually made changes to my diet — I knew it wasn't realistic to overhaul my entire diet overnight. I started by preparing all of my meals at home, rather than ordering takeout, and started focusing on nutrient-dense, higher protein foods.

I tracked calories in the very beginning, which helped me to learn serving sizes and portion control. I had no idea how many calories were in certain foods, so tracking did help.

For the first year, I limited certain foods (fast food, takeout), but I did not cut them out completely. I allowed myself to eat them in moderation. For the last year-and-a-half I have completely cut out meat, but this decision was unrelated to weight loss.

The exercise factor:

I did not join a gym or hire a personal trainer. I did, and still do, all of my training at home. I do all of my weight training and cardio at home with what equipment I have. (Weights, treadmill, benches, barbell, etc.)

Before I started training I was completely inactive other than walking to run errands or walking to school. I had not worked out in years prior to starting my journey.

I still do all of my training at home. I do resistance training, weight lifting, and cardio, both walking and running. I aim to work out three to five days per week. Each workout typically takes about 60 minutes, sometimes slightly less.

Because my goal is no longer weight loss, my focus now is on maintaining my current weight and healthy lifestyle. I make sure to switch up my workouts fairly often to challenge my body.

A post shared by STEPHANIE KATRINA (@stephaniekatrinaa) on Sep 5, 2017 at 1:19pm PDT

How I stay motivated:

I remind myself of my ""why"": Why I started, why I wanted to make changes, and why I continue to live the way that I do. I train often and eat well because I feel at my best mentally and physically when I do so. And I know that if I were to return to my old lifestyle, I would feel just as miserable as I once did.

The day-to-day:

I work out multiple days during the week and once on weekends. I write a lot, I read a lot, and I am constantly striving to improve myself not only physically, but mentally as well.

I do allow myself treats and ""cheat"" days, however I try to eat well 75% of the time. Finding a balance that works for me has allowed me to maintain my current weight for a long time, while not having to be utterly restrictive with my diet.

What I'm most proud of:

My resilience. As someone living with major depressive disorder, it's not easy battling your own mind every day. I am proud of myself for accomplishing all that I have, despite the difficulties that I've endured along the way.

I regret not being kinder to myself along the way. I am just now learning that we can love ourselves as we are, while still striving to make changes and improvements in our lives. Being kind to ourselves makes the journey a lot more enjoyable. I wish I had realized that from the very beginning.

Final thoughts:

Know that as human beings, we are always capable of change, both physically and mentally. Though it may feel this way, you're never stuck in your current body, or current circumstances. If you want something badly enough, with hard work, perseverance, and belief in yourself, you can do anything that you set out to do.

In einem Reformpapier rechnet er auch mit dem eigenen Wahlkampf ab

""Jünger und weiblicher"" sollte die SPD nach dem Debakel bei der Bundestagswahl werden. Zu sehen ist davon allerdings bisher wenig. Parteichef Martin Schulz drängt nun laut einem Medienbericht auf eine umfassende Reform der SPD.

Die Mitglieder sollen künftig in Personalfragen - auch auf Bundesebene - stärker mitbestimmen können. Das stehe in einem entsprechenden Leitantrag für den Bundesparteitag im Dezember, berichtet der ""Spiegel"".

Ziel sei es, spätestens 2019 über den SPD-Vorsitz per Urwahl abstimmen zu lassen, zitiert das Nachrichtenmagazin Parteikreise. Bislang ist eine Urwahl nur für die Frage der Kanzlerkandidatur vorgesehen.

""Der Kanzlerkandidat und die SPD haben die Wahl verloren""

In dem Papier gehe Schulz auch überraschend hart mit dem SPD-Wahlkampf ins Gericht. ""Nicht die Medien, nicht die Demoskopen und auch nicht die politischen Gegner sind schuld an unserer Wahlniederlage"", zitiert der ""Spiegel"" daraus.

""Der Kanzlerkandidat und die gesamte SPD haben diese Wahl verloren."" Vielen Wählern sei nicht klar gewesen, wofür die SPD stehe.

Zudem habe es an einer klaren Botschaft an die Wähler gefehlt. Viele Wähler hätten den Eindruck gehabt, ""die SPD treibe jeden Tag eine 'neue Sau durch das Dorf', schreibe Schulz in dem Reformpapier.

""Eine verständliche Erzählung, wo wir mit dem Land hinwollen, fehlt - und damit eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für echte Zukunftskompetenz"", zitiert der ""Spiegel"" weiter.

Ruf nach Erneuerung

Schulz' Papier sei weder ""revolutionär"", noch biete es ein ""fertiges Konzept für den Wiederaufbau der SPD"", kommentiert das Nachrichtenmagazin. Allerdings enthalte das Dokumente viele Anhaltspunkte, wie es für die Sozialdemokraten weitergehen könnte.

Zuletzt hatte Hamburgs Bürgermeister Olaf Scholz sich mit einem Papier in die Debatte um die Erneuerung der SPD eingemischt. Er forderte eine ""schonungslose Betrachtung der Lage"".

D'autant plus qu'elle a été partagée par des gens que j'estime, alors qu'elle reste pour moi le reflet d'une misogynie bien ancrée et qui refuse de dire son nom. Je me suis donc accordé un droit de réponse.

Cher Nicolas Bedos,

Vers l'âge de 12 ans, j'apprends qu'un de mes cousins, un adulte, avait commis des attouchements sur une de mes cousines de 8 ans. Peu de temps auparavant, il avait tenté de violer une autre de mes cousines qui en avait fait part à ses parents. Tout le monde savait.

Quand j'étais étudiante, j'apprends que mes amies à Sciences Po qui avaient DSK comme professeur, demandaient à leurs copines d'attendre devant la porte lorsqu'elles avaient à passer un oral avec lui, de peur de se retrouver dans une situation ""délicate"". J'ai raconté cette histoire devant des adultes, des journalistes, des professeurs et les réactions n'ont été que rires et blagues graveleuses. Tout le monde savait.

Il y a quelques temps, je me suis fait agresser en boîte de nuit par un type que je connaissais vaguement. Le serveur d'un café qui me draguait et dont j'ai toujours repoussé les avances. En racontant l'histoire à des gens qui le connaissent, je me suis aperçue qu'il n'en était pas à son premier fait d'armes. Tout le monde savait.

Pour tous les cas que je viens de citer, des gouttes d'eau dans un océan de plaintes étouffées, ""un seul nom suffisait"". Ce nom que l'on vous demande de balancer aujourd'hui, certes bêtement, est celui que l'on s'échange sous le manteau depuis des années. Celui qui a pu faire rire sous cape. Celui qui a pu devenir un mythe (""Je vais te faire une Baupin"", ""Je suis le DSK de France 2""). Et pourquoi on vous le demande Nicolas? Parce que jusque ici, ce type-là est resté impuni alors que tout le monde savait. Jusqu'ici c'étaient mes cousines, les étudiantes de Sciences Po, ou moi-même qui devions avoir honte de nos agressions.

Je pense d'ailleurs que tout cela vous le savez pertinemment, comme la différence entre la drague lourde et le harcèlement, je ne vais pas vous faire l'affront de vous donner un cours sur la notion de consentement. D'ailleurs, je prendrai comme un jeu rhétorique de votre part le fait que vous compariez un violeur à un homme infidèle ou à un radin. Vous-même, je pense, vous choisiriez sans hésiter l'option ""mon radin de patron a refusé de m'augmenter"" plutôt que ""mon violeur de patron m'a sodomisé de force"".

Par contre ne me demandez pas de ""comprendre votre colère"". Je la trouve déplacée. Vous avez l'impression, en tant qu'homme, d'être devenu un gibier? Mais n'est-ce pas cela, entre autres, qui révolte les femmes? D'avoir le sentiment d'être traquée en permanence?

Et que cela soit clair, je n'ai pas choisi les exemples ci-dessus pour remettre en cause le fait que DSK soit un économiste brillant, que j'ai de bons souvenirs d'enfance avec mon cousin, ou que le serveur qui m'a agressée soit le roi des Frozen Margaritas. Comme je ne remets pas en cause le fait que les films de Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, Kevin Spacey ou produits par Harvey Weinstein puissent être remarquables. J'ai été fan du ""Cosby show"" comme de la musique de Michael Jackson ou de Noir Désir. D'ailleurs, Emile Louis était sûrement un formidable chauffeur de bus et peut-être dans un autre contexte, j'aurais pu prendre un café avec Guy Georges et trouver le mec super sympa.

La question de séparer l'homme de l'œuvre ou même ""la bête"", ""le porc"", puisqu'on l'a nommé ainsi, de l'être humain (du voisin, du copain, du père, du fils, du cousin), pose question et cela personne ne peut le nier. C'est philosophiquement et humainement un débat à avoir. Mais a-t-on pour autant besoin de le porter aux nues? Qu'un homme qui a tué sa femme à coups de poing fasse la une des magazines? Qu'un organisme public rende hommage à un homme accusé de plusieurs viols et qui fuit la justice depuis des années? Est-ce cela pour vous un monde libre? Un monde où le talent, le pouvoir et l'argent excusent tout? Où les coupables n'ont pas honte? Où l'on dit aux victimes encore une fois de se taire car leur parole ne vaut rien contre la leur? Mais surtout, est-ce vraiment cela sur quoi porte le débat aujourd'hui?

Et si vous (re)lisiez King Kong théorie de Virginie Despentes? Ou Le deuxième sexe de Simone de Beauvoir? Et si vous creusiez un peu plus les pensées de Françoise Héritier, Marguerite Duras ou Geneviève Fraisse? (pardon, vous n'avez cité QUE des hommes, je me permets de ne citer QUE des femmes). Vous comprendriez sûrement que ce qui se passe aujourd'hui n'est pas ""une chasse aux sorcières au nom du progrès moral"". Et que derrière ce #, ce n'est pas seulement un ras-le-bol qui s'exprime, mais la remise en cause d'un système où se construisent et se perpétuent inégalités et stéréotypes. Un système tellement ancré en nous, hommes comme femmes, qu'il nous a amené à considérer que la violence envers la moitié de l'humanité était naturelle, puisque jusqu'ici personne n'a rien fait.

Et lorsque l'on vous demande si vous connaissez des gens autour de vous qui auraient pu avoir ce genre de comportement, n'est-ce pas beaucoup plus facile de prendre la plume pour dénoncer les dérives totalitaires d'une ""dénonciation arbitraire"", que de se poser les vraies questions: ""Ai-je moi aussi un jour été un ""porc""? ""Ai-je, même sans m'en apercevoir, dépassé la limite? Ai-je laissé passer des comportements inacceptables qui se sont déroulés sous mes yeux, par peur, lâcheté, ignorance? Et la réponse est oui, Nicolas, vous l'avez fait. Je l'ai fait aussi. Nous l'avons tous fait. Cette déferlante vous gêne et tant mieux, car elle vous remet et nous remet tous en question.

Et puis, n'avez-vous pas un peu l'impression que sous couvert de fustiger la pensée unique, vous en êtes en fait le parfait représentant: le mâle alpha blanc. Celui qui occupe la place dans les médias, à l'assemblée, dans les postes à responsabilité et les conseils d'administration, celui qui a, par définition, le pouvoir et la parole. Celui qui n'a pas besoin de quota, de manifs ou de # pendémique pour être écouté. Parce que, si vous approuvez le fait qu'enfin les voix des femmes s'élèvent, pourquoi mettre un bémol en parlant au-dessus d'elles? Si vous souhaitez réellement que les femmes de votre entourage n'aient plus à subir et que cette parole libérée permette enfin de changer les choses, pourquoi déplacer (et accaparer) le débat?

Dans un couple ""tout sauf le silence dites-vous""? Mais vous n'êtes pas en couple avec la moitié de l'humanité que je sache? Et même si je suivais votre raisonnement jusqu'au bout, si votre femme vous apprend qu'elle a été agressée par le facteur, allez-vous lui couper la parole pour lui rétorquer: ""je comprends chérie, mais il va d'abord falloir laisser faire la justice avant de prévenir les voisins et qu'il arrête de venir livrer le courrier chez nous... et puis on ne peut pas lui retirer que c'est un bon facteur, il monte les Chronoposts jusqu'au 6ème...».

Pensez-vous, Nicolas, qu'il serait possible qu'un homme, juste pendant un moment, n'ait rien à dire, juste à écouter? Rien à ajouter si ce n'est tenter de comprendre quelque chose qui le dépasse? Rien à faire, si ce n'est son examen de conscience?

Il n'y a pas à proprement parler de guerre des sexes. Mais oui, il y a bien une révolte et comme dans toute révolte qui se respecte, il y a ceux, dont vous faites partie, ainsi que ""vos amis avec qui vous discutez en privé"", bien accrochés à leurs acquis qui ne veulent pas voir les choses bouger. Ceux qui en critiquent le sens, les méthodes, qui tentent de diviser (""toutes les femmes ne pensent pas cela voyons...""). Ceux qui sous couvert de s'interroger, sont juste terrifiés à l'idée que le monde qui arrive ""soit moins profitable"". Moins profitable à qui? À eux... et à eux seulement.

Le Liban vit depuis le dernier accord électoral entre les différentes forces politiques et religieuses dans une relative stabilité qui pourrait servir d'exemple à d'autres pays de cet Orient compliqué.

Un accord historique entre le parti chrétien de Michel Aoun, le parti sunnite du Futur de Saad Hariri et la branche politique du Hezbollah chiite a permis à des groupes politiques et religieux le plus souvent en désaccord sur tout de s'entendre sur l'essentiel: la stabilité du Liban; stabilité essentielle dans une région dévastée par la guerre en Syrie et l'afflux sans précédent du flot de migrants venus gonfler celui des très nombreux Palestiniens vivant dans les camps du Sud et du Nord.

Mais l'issue de la guerre en Syrie pourrait mettre en péril ce fragile équilibre.

Les nouveaux développements du conflit qui après sept années de guerre ont permis à la Russie et à l'Iran en soutenant le régime de Damas de reprendre la main et de devenir incontournables dans la région ne sont pas du goût de ceux qui souhaitaient installer à Damas un régime moins docile à Téhéran. C'est pourquoi le risque est grand de voir l'Arabie Saoudite, Washington et Israël rechigner à reconnaître ce nouvel état de fait et chercher à mener la guerre sur un nouveau théâtre d'opération, le Liban.

Il est frappant de constater lors des réunions avec les différents acteurs politiques du Liban à quel point les divergences sur les développements de la guerre en Syrie sont fortes.

Et c'est précisément là où se situe la nouvelle menace pour la région: le déplacement de la confrontation entre sunnites proches des Saoudiens et chiites proches du Hezbollah iranien sur le territoire libanais.

En effet, les représentants sunnites du courant du Futur qui ont accepté de participer à la Coalition du président Aoun sont très sévères à l'égard du Hezbollah qu'ils accusent d'avoir abandonné la guerre contre Israël dans le Golan pour aller défendre le régime syrien de Bachar el Assad, ravivant ainsi les plaies d'un passé douloureux marqué par la guerre civile. Il est appuyé en cela par le principal parti d'opposition le parti du Cèdre de Samir Gemayel pour qui le principal ennemi reste le Hezbollah.

Quant à ceux du parti de Michel Aoun ils voient au contraire dans le Hezbollah un rempart contre le terrorisme et contre la main mise en Syrie de groupes islamistes radicaux, réelle menace pour le Liban.

Mais l'Arabie Saoudite vient de sonner la fin de la récréation: le prince héritier Mohammad Ben Salman (MBS) a dû convoquer Saad Hariri, le lendemain de la diffusion d'un tweet de l'un de ses ministres exhortant la nouvelle coalition à Beyrouth à se séparer des ministres du Hezbollah, mettant ainsi le premier ministre Saad Hariri dans une position inconfortable.

L'Arabie Saoudite pourrait ainsi prendre sa revanche sur sa défaite en Syrie contre le Hezbollah iranien, en faisant voler en éclat la coalition au pouvoir au Liban. Les propos incendiaires de Donald Trump contre l'Iran et la possible remise en cause du deal sur le nucléaire iranien l'y ont probablement poussés.

De plus l'arrivée de plus d'un million de migrants syriens sur le sol libanais rend la situation économique du pays très difficile ; il est par ailleurs inquiétant de constater au Nord du Liban, non loin de la frontière syrienne, à Tripoli, l'implantation d'un islam whahhabite...

L'Arabie Saoudite cherche sans aucun doute à peser dans le nouveau scénario syrien et à empêcher les Libanais de reprendre des relations avec la Syrie alors même qu'un nouvel ambassadeur à Damas vient d'être nommé...

Le rôle des Russes sera donc essentiel pour maintenir l'équilibre entre les Iraniens et les Saoudiens. C'est pourquoi Vladimir Poutine multiplie les rencontres avec Tel-Aviv, Ryiad et Téheran afin d'obtenir un consensus pour former une délégation unique de l'opposition syrienne lors des prochaines négociations de Genève le 10 Novembre prochain et prenant date pour l'organisation d'un congrès du peuple syrien à Damas en mars prochain.

Il est important que la coalition du président Aoun soit confortée au prochaines élections en mai prochain et qu'elle soutienne le processus de réconciliation et une nouvelle Constitution qui préserverait la souveraineté de la Syrie en y associant toutes les composantes de la société syrienne: une nouvelle Syrie dans laquelle les minorités seraient parties prenantes du pouvoir, comme celle des Kurdes, victorieux combattants de la lutte contre l'Etat Islamique, et dans laquelle les femmes participeraient activement à la vie politique et sociale du pays.

C'est seulement à ces conditions que les nombreux réfugiés syriens pourraient envisager progressivement leur retour en Syrie permettant ainsi de faire baisser les tensions au Liban.

C'est de la réussite de cette Syrie que dépend également l'avenir de la stabilité du Liban.

L'Europe devrait mettre tout son poids dans la balance pour aider à une réconciliation en mettant de côté ses divergences politiques.

Le Président français, Emmanuel Macron rencontre prochainement Vladimir Poutine au Forum de Saint Pétersbourg et le président Rohani prochainement à Téhéran.

Gageons que le réalisme politique l'emportera.

Nicolas Mesly, reporter et photographe

Hugo Jolion-David, journaliste vidéo



« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

RIYADH, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's air defence forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen over the capital Riyadh on Saturday, state news agencies reported.

The missile was brought down near King Khaled Airport on the northern outskirts of the city and did not cause any casualties, said state-owned Al Ekhbariya TV.

Rocket fragments fell near the airport grounds, but air traffic carried on normally, the civil aviation authority said on its official Twitter account.

Residents of northern Riyadh reported hearing a single deafening explosion that rattled windows around 20:20 local time, followed by rumbling and sounds of low-flying aircraft.

""We heard an enormous loud boom and went outside, then heard a low rumbling noise like thunder and six to 12 smaller explosions,"" one resident told Reuters.

The northwestern city of Saada in Yemen was hit by an airstrike in November.

The missile was fired into Saudi territory from Yemen at 20:00 local time, the spokesman of a Saudi-led military coalition said in a statement carried by state news agency SPA.

Houthi-run Saba News in Yemen reported that the missile was a Burkan H2 and that the airport had been the target.

The Saudi-led coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against the Iran-allied Houthi movement that controls much of neighbouring Yemen. On Wednesday, witnesses said one such strike killed 26 people at a hotel and adjoining market in northern Yemen, although the coalition said on Saturday it had hit a legitimate target.

The Houthi and allied forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi territory over the course of a 2-1/2 year war, including a ballistic missile shot down near Mecca in July.

The conflict has led to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people.

Allahu AkbarThe saying literally means God is the greatest.
It is required of all Muslims to say several times during prayer, which is demanded five times a day.
So when and why is the phrase Allahu Akbar used as a battle cry, when a terrorist is about to kill someone?
Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone.","I grew up saying “Allahu Akbar” numerous times every day.

And no, I wasn’t, and am not, a terrorist.

I wasn’t someone who blew buildings up, killed people or shot a missile from my rocket launcher. As far as the West is concerned, those are the events associated with the saying when something bad is about to happen. People of the West are terrified of the phrase.

I was a Muslim boy trying to pray as many times as he could amidst a life of love and peace, in a home that did not condone any terrorism. My father was a poet who read me love poetry instead of nursery rhymes. He uttered the phrase when he prayed. If love existed in the form of a man, it was my father.

“Love everyone,” was the phrase he uttered almost daily. To him, there was not a problem he couldn’t solve with love.

Allahu Akbar

The saying literally means God is the greatest. It is required of all Muslims to say several times during prayer, which is demanded five times a day. On the average a Muslim ends up saying it hundreds of times. The words are also used as a celebration of life: When a baby is born, when a couple marry or when a veteran returns home safe.

The word Islam means surrender. You’re supposed to surrender to God and worship him. Love, mercy and compassion are uttered several hundred times a day by any Muslim when they say Besm Allah Alrahman Alraheem, In The Name Of God The Merciful The Compassionate. That saying is uttered before you do anything.

So when and why is the phrase Allahu Akbar used as a battle cry, when a terrorist is about to kill someone? The latest incident was the horrific act in New York when the terrorist shouted the phrase before the police shot him, and after he killed eight people and injured many more.

For the majority of Muslims, to shout God’s name as you killed the innocent is an abomination. Muslims no more want innocent people killed than anyone else. So why is the phrase used by terrorists?

For the same reason ISIS and Al-Qaida exist: The misinterpretation of Islam. When you use religion as the motive for you actions, you have the power to appeal to the masses. It’s a brain washing if you will. The terrorists who flew the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11th are no different than any suicide bomber in Israel/Palestine, are no different that the one who mowed down bicyclists in New York. They are people who misunderstood and misused the religion. They are sick and twisted and evil.

The phrase is to remind Muslims that God is supreme. That’s it. It was never to be used as a battle cry during horrendous actions furthering political agendas with evil motives.

My heart sank when I heard the terrorist shouted the saying after the attack. I will never understand the link between Islam and Terrorism. The Islam I grew up amidst condemns such actions. It preaches love and peace and tranquility and feeding the hungry and clothing the poor and sheltering the homeless. One of the five main requirements of Islam in addition to prayer and fasting is to give a percentage of your money to the poor.

Is There A Difference?

To me, there is no difference between the terrorists who shout Allahu Akbar when committing a crime and those white nationalists and racists who shouted “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville ― Virginia recently.

Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone. Why is it only attached to people who claim Islamic affiliation?

The Quran was brought down to Muhammad in the seventh century. The verses which preach war and fighting were contextual and apply to the time when he and his followers had no choice but to fight back, or die. It is no different than the Old Testament which contains many verses preaching war and killing.

In Deuteronomy Chapter 2, Verses 32-37, Moses is told to kill men, women, and children:

“And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Siphon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones , of every city, we left none to remain. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us.”

How is this any different than what’s in the Quran? And why are Muslims judged by a different prism? Most of the Quran preaches love and harmony and helping those who have not. Take this for example:

“And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you.” [76:8-9]

Any ancient religious book can be misunderstood and misrepresented. The Ku Klux Klan said the Jesus was the first Klansman. They burned crosses to spread their ill will. How is that any different?

My Sister

Karim Shamsi-Basha My sisters Mimi, right, and Rowaida.

My sister Rowaida lives in New York. We chatted last night when I wanted to make sure her head covering was not causing any problems. In the past when terrorists committed atrocities in the name of Islam, women with head coverings were profiled. She said everything was fine, and prayed for those people affected by the terror.

My sister prayed for them.

She is a teacher and her husband is an architect. All they want is food, water, and a roof over their heads, and for their children to thrive. They have four: a computer scientist, a doctor, a physical therapist, and a pharmacist. They love like anyone else, and they have compassion and mercy and empathy like anyone else.

The covering on her head says two things: Modesty and humility.

A Wish Or Two

I have one wish, well maybe two.

The first is for my children to thrive and go through life without any judgment based on their last name.

The second is for this world to know that Muslims mean no one any harm. The people who mean harm are as far from Islam as the KKK is far from Christianity.

""Alleinstehende Bezieher von Hartz-IV-Leistungen haben in NRW Anspruch auf 50 qm Wohnfläche"" bestätigte das Landessozialgericht Nordrhein-Westfalen (LSG NRW) in einem Urteil vom 16.5.2011 (L 19 AS 2202/10).

Das Ministerium für Arbeit, Integration und Soziales (MAIS) reagierte in einem Erlass vom 15.08.2012. Auch die Geschäftsführung des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis wurde über die veränderte Rechtslage in Kenntnis gesetzt und zur Korrektur bestandskräftiger Leistungsbescheide von Amts wegen verpflichtet.

In dem Erlass heißt es unmissverständlich:

""II. Von Amts wegen sind bestandskräftige Leistungsbescheide nach § 22 SGB II mit Wirkung für die Vergangenheit nach § 44 SGB X iVm. § 40 SGB II zurückzunehmen, wenn die Rechte der Leistungsberechtigten infolge der Nichtanwendung der ab dem 01 .01.2010 geltenden WNB betroffen und Leistungen nach § 22 SGB II zu Unrecht nicht erbracht worden sind. Ggf. reicht die Rückwirkung in der Regel bis zum 01.01.2011.""

Mittels Überprüfungsantrag gem. § 44 SGB X hatte P. Vorsorge getroffen, dass auch für das Jahr 2010 keine bestandskräftigen Leistungsbescheide vorliegen. Damit erweiterte sich sein Rechtsanspruch automatisch um ein Jahr.

Dazu kam noch die Tatsache, dass das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis über kein „schlüssiges Konzept"" für die Ermittlung der Kosten der Unterkunft verfügte. (Auch das aktuelle Konzept der Firma Analyse & Konzepte ist derzeit noch beim LSG (L 6 AS 120/17) anhängig.)

Bereits die Weisung MAIS war eine Rechtsverletzung in der Absicht der Vermögensschädigung für Tausende von Betroffenen im Jahr 2010.

In den Mühlen der Rechtsverdreher - Jobcenter verweigert Erstattung

Existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen gibt es anscheinend nur auf dem Klageweg.

In der Zeit vom 08.07.2011 bis zum 26.11.2013 führte P. zwei KDU-Klagen vor dem Sozialgericht in Dortmund. In dieser Zeit wechselten dreimal die zuständigen Richter.

Zuletzt musste das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis den erfolgreichen Rechtsanwalt und für die Bewilligungszeiträume vom 01.08.2011-31.01.2012 (S 19 AS 4056/11; W 578/11) und vom 01.02.2012-31.07.2012 (S 19 AS 308/12, W 83/12) 12 x 48,40 € = 580,80 € bezahlen.

Trotz ministerialer Weisung vom 15.08.2012 verweigerte das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis Jahre lang die von Amts wegen angeordnete Erstattung von Januar 2011 bis Juli 2011, also weitere 7 Monate á 48,40 € = 338,80 €.

Am Donnerstag, den 17.07.2014 wurde ein weiteres Hauptsacheverfahren über die Nachzahlung der KDU für das Jahr 2010 im Sozialgericht Dortmund unter Vorsitz der Richterin Sülow verhandelt. Dabei ging es um den Beweis des fristgerechten Zugangs zweier Überprüfungsanträge.

Als Behördenvertreterin des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis behauptete die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch. im Termin ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"". Diese Behauptung wurde ohne jeden belastbaren Beweis vorgetragen und völlig anhaltslos geglaubt.

Richterin Sülow schenkte der unbewiesenen Aussage mehr Glauben als dem Verfasser als Faxversender, obwohl nachweislich drei gesendete Faxe mit Datum, Uhrzeit und Nummer des Jobcenters an das Jobcenter Iserlohn gesandt worden waren.

Untätigkeitsklage trotz unstritigem Rechtsanspruch

Mit dieser Entwicklung hatte niemand gerechnet. 580,80 € verloren, weil die Jobcenter-Mitarbeiterin behauptete ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"".

Im Urteil des Sozialgericht Dortmund vom 17.07.2014 (S 19 AS 357/12) heißt es:

""Zur Begründung führt sie aus, ein Überprüfungsantrag vom 14.06.2011 sei dort weder bekannt noch zugegangen. Empfangsjournale des Faxgerätes mit der Nummer 02371/905799 für den 14.06.2011 seien bei dem Beklagten nicht mehr vorhanden.""

Damit wurde die Untätigkeitsklage für den Zeitraum 01.01.2010 bis 30.06.2011 über 48,40 € monatlich und damit insgesamt 871,20 Euro Existenzsichernde Leistungen abgewiesen, obwohl der Rechtsanspruch auf der Grundlage des WNB NRW unstrittig ist.

Spätere Recherchen zeichnen die Vorgänge jedoch klarer: Die Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags erfolgte durch die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch., die nicht einmal in dem Gebäude Friedrichstraße 59/61, sondern in der Brausestraße arbeitet, in dem das entsprechende Faxgerät steht.

Außerdem war wohl zum Zeitpunkt des Faxzugangs (21:37 Uhr) niemand mehr im Gebäude. Ob die betreffende Beklagtenvertreterin überhaupt nur einmal einen Faxeingang in der Hauptzentrale miterlebt hat? Von der Erfassung im ""Eingangsbuch"" ganz zu schweigen.

Als sicher gelten darf aber, dass die Reinigungskräfte das Büro häufiger betreten als die Wortführende ""Zeugin"" mit ihrer Behauptung.

Auch die Zeit der Faxübertragung, Dienstag, 14.06.2011 um 21:37 Uhr, lässt die Aussage der Jobcentervertreterin unglaubwürdig erscheinen.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.

Diese Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags wertete die Vorsitzende Richterin höher als die Aussage der Person, die das Fax versendet, die ordnungsgemäße Übertragung überprüft hat, die Eintragung der Übersendung eigens dokumentiert hat und anschließend den Überprüfungsantrag in den entsprechenden Ordner einlegt hat.

Berufungsverfahren bei Landessozialgericht in Essen

Am 03.04.2015 wurde eine Berufungsverhandlung beim LSG NRW verhandelt. Die Richter stellten auch einen gravierenden Rechtsverstoß in der Bescheidbearbeitung fest, was zu einer weiteren Nachzahlung von 338,80 € für die Zeit vom 01.01.2011-31.07.2011 führte, wollten aber keine Nachzahlung für das Jahr 2010 entscheiden.

Noch immer sind 580,80 € offen.

Und noch eine weitere Klagerunde

Nachdem weder das SG Dortmund noch das LSG NRW vollständig Abhilfe schaffen wollten, wurde ein drittes Mal in gleicher Sache der Rechtsweg über eine juristische Hintertür beschritten.



Am 01.07.2015 wurden zwei Überprüfungsanträge wegen der Ablehnungsbescheide vom 03.04.2012 & 16.04.2012 per Fax an je drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis (Fax: 02371 905-799; 905-848; 905-859) gesandt.

Um postalische Eingangsbestätigung der Überprüfungsanträge wurde ausdrücklich gebeten.

Am 03.08.2015, 31.08.2015, 05.10.2015, 28.10.2015, 30.11.2015 und 31.12.2015 erfolgten Erinnerungen. Zwei Faxe an jeweils drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis. - Ganz wie beim ersten Mal!

Siebenmal Sechs Fax-Anträge. Bei keinem der 42 Anträge erfolgte auch nur ein Bescheid. Nicht einmal eine Eingangsbestätigung. Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.

Inzwischen ist eine weitere Untätigkeitsklage (Az.: S 14 AS 1515/16) anhängig und die Überprüfungsanträge sind aus der Akte verschwunden.

Kein Ende der Klageflut

Wer nicht klagt, bekommt auch nichts - so die erschreckende Erfahrung vieler Leistungsberechtigter.

Die Statistik der BA „Widersprüche und Klagen SGB II - September 2017 listet 407 Jobcenter auf und weist für das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis einen Bestand von 1714 anhängigen Klagen aus, das sind 10% bei 17.149 Bedarfsgemeinschaften (nur 41 Jobcenter verwalten mehr BG's; 50 Jobcenter haben mehr Klagen anhängig)

Au début du mois d'octobre, la dessinatrice de bande dessinée a publié avec l'auteure Ovidie un ""Manifeste pour s'affranchir des diktats sexuels"", intitulé ""Libres!"".

Dans ce livre à quatre mains, elles décryptent, chapitre par chapitre, toutes les oppressions qui pèsent sur les femmes dans leurs rapports sexuels: les poils sur les jambes et les règles, les injonctions à la sodomie et à la fellation, la minceur et les grosses fesses...

Avec un unique conseil: ""Nous sommes les seules décisionnaires de ce que nous faisons de notre corps, [...] rien ni personne ne devrait jamais nous dicter notre conduite"".

A chaque fois, Diglee rebondit, à travers quelques dessins, puis avec une planche qui met en scène des situations quotidiennes en lien avec le thème, imaginées ou bien réelles.

""Le but c'est d'accepter ce qu'on est, et d'être bienveillant avec les autres, accepter les pratiques des autres.""

Un voile d'injonctions

""Depuis fin 2014, je traitais des sujets de féminisme sur mon blog"", explique-t-elle. ""J'étais en pleine déconstruction, j'avais une réflexion sur la condescendance dans le milieu de la BD où on m'accolait le terme 'girly' pour mes œuvres."" Ainsi, on lui a déjà refusé une couverture, parce que l'héroïne était ""trop grosse"".

""La liberté dont on manque le plus aujourd'hui"", explique-t-elle, ""est la liberté de disposer de son corps"". Au-delà des questions de sexualité portées par Ovidie, elle a tenu à réserver une place importante à ce rapport au corps. ""Il faut réfléchir à savoir où se trouver la liberté, quand tous les gestes du quotidien sont très normés, quand je vois tout ce qu'on s'inflige."" Et d'illustrer ses propos: ""C'est comment si on revêtait un voile d'injonctions"".

Pour le HuffPost, elle décrit trois de ses planches publiées dans ce manifeste:

""Cette planche est partie d'une histoire, la diffusion du schéma interne du clitoris par une enseignante qui avait réalisé une maquette.

C'est violent et fort que le clitoris soit invisibilisé. Il était totalement absent des manuels scolaires. Tout ce qu'on ne nomme pas n'existe pas, une majorité de filles de 13 ans ne connaissaient pas son existence. De ce flou total, on en tire une honte de notre sexe. C'est un immense frein à une sexualité saine, riche en plaisir. On découvre aujourd'hui des choses sur son anatomie, alors qu'il paraît simple de décrire un organe.""

""Les dessins sont retranscrits d'après une scène réelle, que l'on m'a racontée. Ça montre à quel point c'est le tabou absolu. C'est tout un système. Même dans le porno où l'on voit des millions de choses, on ne voit pas un seul filet de sang. Dans les publicités, c'est la même chose. Ça concerne la moitié de l'humanité, et on n'en parle pas, on a des langages codés pour en parler entre filles, on apprend très vite à en avoir honte.""

""Les poils, c'est un sujet que j'aborde depuis le tout début de mon blog.

En tant que femme, on a beaucoup trop de poils, on devient un monstre. On ne voit pas de femmes non épilée, même dans les pubs pour l'épilation elles sont déjà épilées...

Quand il y a un article sur le sujet, les réactions sont très violentes. C'est un sujet très important, une des injonctions les plus marquées. Ça suscite du dégoût, de la colère, on ne peut pas sortir sans susciter des débats, des questionnements.

Dans la planche, cette jeune fille cède, parce qu'il faut énormément de courage quand on est confronté à ces discours. On peut avoir un discours distancé, et céder. Ce serait utopique de la voir résister, parce que ça déclenche tellement de violence... . On n'a pas le temps d'avoir le choix, les poils féminins dérangent trop.""

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images

The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report. Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a “she-ro,” using the hashtag #Her2020.

The woman’s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn’t so happy about the photo. They fired her over it.

In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger.

As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima’s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday. By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company’s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook.

“They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” said Briskman. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’”

Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn’t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don’t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said.

Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. But Briskman said what’s been particularly infuriating is that a male colleague kept his job after recently posting lewd comments on his Facebook page that featured Akima LLC as his cover photo. She said this colleague was reprimanded for calling someone “a fucking Libtard asshole” on Facebook, but was allowed to delete the post and keep his job.

“How is that any less ‘obscene’ than me flipping off the president?” she asked. “How is that fair?”

Akima did not respond to requests for comment via email and phone.

Juli Briskman Someone posted this graphic on Juli Briskman's Facebook page after she flipped off the president's motorcade. Briskman was amused.

Asked what she was thinking when she saw Trump’s motorcade roll up next to her, Briskman said it was a gut reaction to flip him off.

“He was passing by and my blood just started to boil,” she said. “I’m thinking, DACA recipients are getting kicked out. He pulled ads for open enrollment in Obamacare. Only one-third of Puerto Rico has power. I’m thinking, he’s at the damn golf course again.”

“I flipped off the motorcade a number of times,” she added.

Briskman, a Democrat, said she plans to look for a new job with an advocacy group that she believes in, like Planned Parenthood or PETA.

Despite getting fired, she said she has no regrets about the attention her public show of displeasure with Trump received. In fact, she said she’s happy to be an image of protest that resonates with many Americans.

“In some ways, I’m doing better than ever,” she said. “I’m angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something.”",Woman Fired For Flipping Off Donald Trump's Motorcade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-flips-off-donald-trump-fired_us_59fe0ab4e4b0c9652fffa484?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

On Thursday, Jackson seemed open to lifting Manafort's house arrest but skeptical of removing his electronic monitoring.","WASHINGTON ― Attorneys for former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told a federal judge on Saturday that he's not ""akin to a 68-year-old 'Jason Bourne' character"" despite his possession of three passports.

Manafort is set to appear in court again on Monday morning for a hearing on the conditions of his release following his arrest last week on 12 federal counts, including conspiracy and money laundering. He and his business associate Rick Gates have pleaded not guilty to the charges brought forward by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Manafort's second court hearing on Thursday that she was concerned that he posed a flight risk. In a court filing on Saturday, Manafort's lawyers assured the judge that the reason he had three passports was ""mundane"": He has a primary passport, a second passport to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries, and a third that he applied for after he lost his primary passport, which he later found.

Manafort's ""frequent flyer status,"" lawyer Kevin Downing wrote, ""should not be over-emphasised to show a potential risk of flight when a person's job requires extensive travel."" He said that Manafort was just a ""successful domestic and international political consultant"" who ""travelled frequently and represented businessmen, political parties, and commercial interests around the world,"" activities that were ""completely"" legal.

""It would be odd, indeed, if he did not frequently travel, both domestically and abroad, given his clientele and the nature of his business,"" Downing wrote.

He also noted that Manafort has been married for almost 40 years and has two daughters and two grandchildren in the U.S. He said that his client's primary assets are also in the United States.

One of the charges that Manafort is facing relates to his alleged failure to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists to disclose when they're working on behalf of a foreign principal. Downing, not incorrectly, said that particular charge was ""rarely pursued (or successfully prosecuted) in a criminal case.""

Manafort is currently on house arrest under electronic monitoring and a $10 million unsecured bond. He's seeking less onerous conditions of release. To guarantee his future court appearances, his attorney said Manafort would be willing to pledge a $3 million Trump Tower apartment in New York City, another $3.5 million home in New York, a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach, Florida, and a ""combination of life insurance policies held in trust and/or in his or his wife's name"" and valued at approximately $4.5 million ― for a total of more than $12 million.

Although Manafort has not yet reached an agreement with prosecutors over the conditions of his release, his lawyers wrote that he would agree to limit his travel to Florida, Virginia, New York and Washington, D.C. Prosecutors with Mueller's office are expected to file their response to the Manafort filing on Sunday.

Im Video oben: Martin reicht der Frau, von der er sich trennen will, ein Mikrofon mit einer unsensiblen Tonaufnahme

Und Kandidat Kevin schenkt Teilnehmerin Nadine statt einer Rose einen Hundeknochen

Die Macher der RTL-Kuppelsendung ""Schwiegertochter gesucht"" laufen in der diesjährigen Staffel wieder zur Höchstform der Menschenverachtung auf. Nachdem sie bereits erfolgreich die minderjährige Teilnehmerin Tutti bloßgestellt haben, ist in der aktuellen Folge Kandidatin Petra dran.

Petra hatte sich neben Catrin für das Wolfgang-Petry-Double Martin beworben. Schon in der Busfahrt zum Haus des Hobby-Sängers und seiner Mutter wurden die beiden mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik beschallt. Die Musik begleitete die Kandidaten von da an jeden Tag im Haus des selbsternannten Doubles.

Da ist es natürlich nur konsequent, dass die Kandidatinnen auch mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik verabschiedet werden. Denn RTL hat sich die wohl geschmackloseste Möglichkeit einfallen lassen, Kandidatin Petra nach Hause zu schicken.

Martin nimmt eine Sprachnachricht der besonderen Art auf

Martin überreichte jeder der Kandidatinnen ein Mikrofon mit einer selbst vertonten Aufnahme. Auf dem ersten Mikrofon sang er in wunderbar schiefer Tonlage: ""Ich habe Sehnsucht nach dir"", auf dem zweiten wiederum: ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"".

Das zweite Mikrofon überreichte er dann in einer Abschieds-Zeremonie der schwer verliebten Kandidatin Petra. Als diese auf den Knopf drückte und Martin fröhlich sang ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"" kamen ihr die Tränen.

Damit ist es RTL wieder einmal gelungen, eine Kandidatin zum Weinen zu bringen. Denn dass Martin selbst sich diese Idee hat einfallen lassen, ist höchst zweifelhaft.

Als Wiedergutmachung hat sich das RTL-Team dafür etwas ganz besonders Romantisches für Kandidatin Nadine einfallen lassen. ""Ich dachte, ich mache es heute mal so wie der Bachelor"", sagte Kevin zu seiner Auserwählten. Nur leider hatte Kevin keine Rose parat. Also reichte er Nadine ganz einfach einen Knochen. Einen Knochen, an dem normalerweise seine Hunde kauen.

Nadine war gerührt und willigte gleich darauf ein, die Nacht mit Kevin im Zelt zu verbringen.

Wer hätte auch widerstehen können, bei Kevins gekonntem Flirt-Spruch: ""Deine Augen gefallen mir, deine Nase auch, ich würde gerne eine Beziehung mit dir versuchen und später dann zusammen ziehen.""

Das kann man auch gleich beim ersten Date mal so klarstellen. Anschließend werden die beiden in einem Zelt schlafen, das so klein ist, dass Kevins Füße hinten rausschauen. Aber es ist bestimmt nicht die Absicht von RTL, sich über die Größe des Zweimeter-Mannes lustig zu machen. Alles purer Zufall, ganz bestimmt.

This started with his split from Amber Heard. When they settled their divorce outside of court, many aspects of the couple’s parting remained private, but a number of others did not. The video of him, drinking and appearing to throw a bottle in his kitchen is on the internet, as is a photograph of a mirror, stained with the name of a man Depp thought his wife was having an affair with. Heard said that the words on it are written in paint and blood, which had leaked from Depp’s hand shortly after he accidentally chopped off a chunk of his finger off (Depp claimed he injured the finger during a filming). In a joint statement, the couple labelled their marriage “at times volatile, but always bound by love”. Heard then donated her entire £7million settlement to charity, giving half to an organisation that works to prevent domestic violence.

The months I spent covering this - writing news stories, a piece on the media’s portrayal of Heard and another on the settlement money - left me with a dislike for Depp, but one that I could put aside when necessary (mainly when I wanted to watch Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands again).

I rolled my eyes when he was announced as the special guest for Glastonbury’s all-new Cinemageddon area and skipped ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ when his role in it was revealed, but knew that others still held highly favourable opinions of him and respected their decisions.

Then on Thursday, I watched as fans clamoured for a glimpse of the star at the Murder On The Orient Express premiere, shouting his name and cheering him on. When Depp appeared on the big screen, the people inside the Royal Albert Hall whooped and clapped and suddenly, the indifference I’d just about managed to just muster up before was gone. Things are different now.

For the past month, the entertainment industry has played host to an unprecedented amount of sexual harassment and abuse allegations, beginning with those against Harvey Weinstein. It’s being described as a “watershed moment” for improving the treatment of women in the industry and time will hopefully confirm that this is the case.

But the revelations that have been made in the last month could also have a ripple effect that we did not initially expect. (It’s hard to know what to call it all, but I refuse to say “scandal” or “controversy” and hasten to label the accounts “incidents”)

For me, it appears that I can no longer find excuses to separate a man’s reported actions from his “art”. It’s too much of an ask when my average working day now includes hours of reading and writing about crimes powerful men in Hollywood have allegedly committed against women (and in some cases, other men).

Let me be clear: Depp and Weinstein are miles apart. The two are not linked and this is not a comparison of their alleged actions. While still unacceptable, incidents that result in your estranged wife requesting a temporary restraining order are not the same as the alleged harassment of over 50 women (Weinstein has denied all claims of nonconsensual sex). But as we deal with the fallout from the latter, I’m finding it harder and harder to look past the former.

Depp isn’t just ‘getting by’ in the industry. The quality of his movies may have flatlined but when it comes to earnings, he’s going from strength to strength. ‘Pirates Of The Caribbean’ continues to be one of Disney’s most financially successful franchises and Depp will also take the lead in the forthcoming ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ films. He occasionally performs with his band, Hollywood Vampires, and fronts a Christian Dior fragrance campaign.

Only time will tell on this, but I wonder what would happen if an actor went through a similar split now, or in a few months time. Would we question them more? Perhaps the actor’s famous friends would hesitate before publicly defending him so fervently. Maybe the video would be remembered for longer and the woman’s words taken more seriously than Heard’s ever were.

The line in the sand has been drawn though, decreeing that Weinstein - who takes the role of a beached whale in this analogy - be left to wilt on the shore as Captain Jack Sparrow sails past untroubled. I’m not saying Depp should face the same consequences as the ones the producer is and, given that his divorce played out pre-Weinstein, it’s unlikely he’ll face anything other than continued adulation from legions of fans in the years to come.

""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""
""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""
The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well.
""Let's face it, there is nothing more humbling than learning a second language and using it because you just revert to [being] a two-year-old.""","Learning a second language is no easy task.

A lot of time and dedication is required, plus there is a significant amount of memorising of words and phrases. And even once you've learnt those, it takes both skill and confidence to use them in a real-life setting.

Well, Associate Professor Evan Kidd from the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language says that anyone can learn a new language as long as they put enough time into the process.

""I think that almost anyone, if they give it a good enough shot, is going to have some abilities in a language with enough exposure and time,"" Kidd told HuffPost Australia.

According to Kidd, one of the biggest challenges adults face when learning a new language is approaching it with the knowledge of their mother tongue. Our brains are finely tuned to our first language and so we approach any new linguistic situation within the framework of that first language.

""The challenge in learning a second language is the fact that you have a first language,"" Kidd said. ""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""

So, what are some ways that we can make the language-learning process easier?

Three ways to make learning a new language easier Use stock phrases Learning a few generic and adaptable phrases in a new language can make it easier to use and also give you a template to build other terms using that same formula. ""It's good to have a few stock phrases because then you can start strapping off from those so you can say -- 'OK I have got this phrase and I can put different verbs in it and different nouns in it', which is actually how young kids tend to learn,"" Kidd said. Memorise When you first start out, learning the basic grammar and vocabulary of any language is going to require time to create a solid linguistic foundation. This means a lot of dedication to learning the words and making an effort to remember those through practice. ""Inevitably, there are going to be instances where you are just going to need to memorise the rule because, let's face it, languages are weird entities."" Actually speak the language Kidd said that in his experience, one of the most important things when learning a new language is making the effort to use it as much as possible. ""It's all fine and good to sit there and learn it and then do in a class, but you really have to talk and I think by virtue of talking that's when you really start to get much more sense that this is a communicative system and you really want to use that to communicate."" ""[It's a] combination between memorisation and a little bit of 'extraversion' and having a go.""

Children are exposed to languages at a very young age, even from the time they are in the womb. The process of acquiring language begins with sounds and language rhythms and eventually builds up to words and sentences.

""One of the cool things about infants when they are born is they have the ability to perceive the difference between any sound that the human vocal tract can make, and the thing is that any one language will only use a subset of those sounds,"" Kidd said.

An interesting example of how this works can be found when the English and Japanese languages are compared.

""In English we have a distinction between the 'R' sound and the 'L' sound but in Japanese they don't have that distinction -- they've got one which is between these two sounds,"" Kidd explained.

""So, what happens when a Japanese infant is born is that they can distinguish between the 'R' and 'L' sounds but once they get to about 12 months they can't do it anymore and that is because their language doesn't have it.""

Children under 12 months can identify every sound a human voice tract can make.

As humans lose this ability around the age of 12 months, we become unable to accurately distinguish some sounds that our mother tongue doesn't use. It's in this way that learning a first and a second language is fundamentally different.

Most of us can't remember learning our first language because it was effortless and occurred over a long period of time, but acquiring that second one requires a lot of hard work.

""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""

The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well. Kidd says that being as confident as possible with another language could be the gateway to your success.

Das ist bei CSU und SPD nicht anders - und völlig normal.

Bei guten Ergebnissen glaubt man keine Analyse nötig zu haben, bei schlechten verzichtet man liebend gerne darauf. Warum auch in noch schwärenden Wunden herumstochern?

""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte""

Auch wenn die CDU sich nicht ernsthaft mit Zahlen beschäftigt, ist sie nach Kräften bemüht, das wenig schmeichelhafte Ergebnis vom 24. September schönzureden. Die CDU ist (außerhalb Bayerns) bei den Zweitstimmen um 7,4 Punkte auf 26,8 Prozent abgesackt.

Sie hat trotz der Aufblähung des Bundestags 55 ihrer bisher 255 Mandate verloren. Sieger sehen so sicher nicht aus. Dennoch handelt die CDU-Spitze, allen voran die Parteivorsitzende und Kanzlerin, nach dem Motto ""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte.""

Folglich verkündete Angela Merkel noch in der Wahlnacht, sie wisse nicht, was sie hätte anders machen können. Also alles paletti?

Die Selbstzufriedenheit der CDU - teils gespielt, teils ernst gemeint - steht auf den ersten Blick im Widerspruch zu der Tatsache, dass mit der AfD rechts von ihr eine neue Partei entstanden ist - nicht durch einen Putsch, sondern von 5,9 Millionen Menschen gewählt.

Doch auf den zweiten Blick wird deutlich, dass der CDU die Rechtsaußen-Partei sogar recht willkommen zu sein scheint. Im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus sieht mancher das ""machttechnisch"" oder zynisch: Eine starke AfD verhindert im Bund schon rechnerisch eine rot-rot-grüne Mehrheit. Folglich bleibt die CDU Kanzlerin-Partei. Was will man also mehr?

Die AfD - ein Ergebnis der eigenen Fehler

Selbst CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber müsste es inzwischen gedämmert haben, dass seine Prognose von 2014, die AfD werde so schnell wieder verschwinden wie einst die Piraten, nicht gerade von großer Weisheit geprägt war.

Inzwischen vermitteln die führenden Köpfe der CDU jedoch den Eindruck, sich mit der Existenz der rechten Konkurrenz abgefunden zu haben. Motto: ""Wenn die da sind, dann sind sie halt da.""

Nebenbei: Sich mit der Existenz der AfD abzufinden, ist für Parteimanager recht bequem. Wenn man die neue Partei wie ein Naturereignis betrachtet und nicht auch als Ergebnis eigener Fehler, dann lebt es sich viel leichter.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Dann bleibt Jamaika ein Luftschloss"": FDP-Chef Lindner stellt Koalition mit den Grünen infrage

Alle Wahlanalysen der Meinungsforscher zeigen: Keine Partei hat so viele Stimmen an die AfD abgegeben wie die Union. Wenn aber vereinzelte CDU-Politiker laut darüber nachdenken, wie man diese enttäuschten Konservativen wieder zurückgewinnen könnte, stoßen sie auf Gleichgültigkeit oder Ablehnung. Stört unsere Jamaika-Kreise nicht, lautet implizit die Botschaft.

Der Merkel-Flügel der CDU behauptet unverdrossen, das Ergebnis habe nichts mit der Flüchtlingspolitik zu tun gehabt, nichts mit dem Kontrollverlust im Herbst 2015, nichts mit ""Köln"" und nichts mit der Angst vor als Flüchtlingen getarnten Gewalttätern.

Das passt nicht so recht zu der Wahlkampfaussage Merkels, ""2015 soll, kann und darf sich nicht wiederholen."" Das passt vor allem nicht zu den demoskopischen Befunden.

Für die Union geht es stetig bergab

In den im September 2015 veröffentlichten Ergebnissen der ""Sonntagsfrage"" von Allensbach kam die CDU/CSU auf 42 Prozent, um schon im Oktober - nach der Grenzöffnung - auf 38 Prozent zu fallen.

Von da an ging's, von einem Zwischenhoch im Sommer 2017 abgesehen, stetig bergab. Wer oder was, wenn nicht die Flüchtlingspolitik, soll diesen Einbruch in der Wählergunst eigentlich bewirkt haben?

Weil der Zusammenhang zwischen weit geöffneten Grenzen und immer schlechter werdenden CDU-Werten nicht zu übersehen ist, hat die Merkel-Fraktion in der CDU eine zweite Verteidigungslinie aufgemacht:

Die 32,9 Prozent für die CDU/CSU seien ein ""normales"" Ergebnis - auf einer Linie mit den 35,2 Prozent von 2005 und den 33,8 Prozent von 2009. Demgegenüber seien die 41,5 Prozent von 2013 ein ""Ausreißer"" gewesen, mithin keine seriöse Vergleichsgröße.

Nun ist es eigentlich kein Komplement für die Kanzlerin, wenn die Union ihre Ergebnisse auf und unter dem Niveau der 35,1 Prozent von Kohls Abwahl im Jahr 1998 für ""normal"" hält. Jedoch empfiehlt es sich, Ergebnisse einer Partei nicht isoliert zu betrachten.

Den Kohl'schen 35,1 Prozent von 1998 standen 52,7 Prozent des rot-rot-grünen Lagers gegenüber, Merkels 32,9 Prozent vom 24. September aber nur noch 38,6 Prozent für SPD/Grüne/Linke.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50

Fazit: Von den Wählern, die sich vor allem von der SPD abgewendet haben, können unter dem Strich keine bei der CDU gelandet sein.

Der Modernisierungskurs der Merkel-Tauber-CDU wurde immer damit begründet, die CDU könne links der Mitte mehr Wähler gewinnen als rechts von der Mitte verlieren. Aber das war reine Theorie oder bloßes Wunschdenken. In der Praxis sprechen die Stimmergebnisse eine andere Sprache.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50. Sollte es dazu kommen, wird die CDU diese Koalition als Ausdruck ihrer Modernität interpretieren.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: CSU-Mann Scheuer äußert sich zu Jamaika - und widerspricht sich in nur 3 Sätzen selbst

Es bedarf freilich einer sehr großen Portion Phantasie, sich bei ""Jamaika"" eine Flüchtlings- oder Familienpolitik vorzustellen, die nach Rechtsaußen abgewanderte CDU-Wähler wieder mit ""ihrer"" Union versöhnen könnte.

Aber darum geht es der CDU-Führung auch gar nicht. Sollen die ungeliebten und unbequemen ""Konservativen"" doch die AfD wählen. Solange die CDU die Kanzlerin stellt, ist dies aus der Perspektive des Adenauer-Hauses ein leicht zu verschmerzender Kollateralschaden.

Übrigens: Adenauer wurde 1949 mit 31,0 Prozent der Stimmen Kanzler. Es ist also noch Luft nach unten.

One thing that is undeniably certain after reading the #CanadaWAITS tweets: we deserve much better health care than we are getting.","Last week, Globe and Mail health columnist Andre Picard sparked something of a firestorm on Twitter. Shocked by a tweet from my colleague Dr. Joy Hataley that showed a 4.5-year wait for a neurology appointment, he requested that people post their stories of unduly long wait times on Twitter, along with #CanadaWAITS.

In short order #CanadaWAITS started trending on Twitter. Patients and physicians started tweeting out stories of ridiculously long wait times. Do you have lung trouble? You could wait a year to see a respirologist. Have a child with autism? Eight months seems to be the minimum to get services. Live in Nothern Ontario? One community has been waiting 12 YEARS for a new family doctor to arrive, another tweet suggests. I encourage you to check out #CanadaWAITS yourself on Twitter for the full list (or better yet, contribute your story if you have one).

The frustrating part for physicians like myself is that we have been telling our various governments this for years. A clear picture of far too few physicians, nurses and allied health-care providers has been evident to those of us in the health-care field for at least a decade. We've been summarily ignored by politicians.

The situation in Ontario is almost comically inept. Faced with the obvious data that there are too few medical specialists to look after the population, what did Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne do? She CUT the number of medical training positions so that there would be fewer specialists (you could not make something like this up).

How about a 12+ year wait (and still waiting) to get a GP in NW Ontario? Even the basics can take an eternity #CanadaWAITS — Dr Lisa Habermehl (@NWOdoctor) November 2, 2017

Armed with the knowledge that wait times for orthopedic surgical procedures is increasing exponentially (214 days on AVERAGE!), what was Wynne's solution? To starve orthopaedic funding to hospitals to such an extent that we have scores of UNEMPLOYED orthopaedic surgeons. That's right, Premier Wynne's government has created an Ontario first — a time when a physician is unable to get work (even though the patient demand is there).

Finally, knowing that there is a shortage of comprehensive care family physicians in Ontario, her solution was to stop funding family health teams that pay physicians by capitation (capitation is a salary + performance bonus) that is preferred by both family physicians and multiple experts who feel the old fee-for-service style of paying physicians is antiquated. That helps explain why, as I've observed before, newer graduates of family medicine residencies are not going into comprehensive family medicine.

What's worse from the perspective of a Canadian citizen is that we spend a LOT on health care. The most recent estimate is $228 BILLION per year. That's $6,300 a year for every man, woman and child. Surely for that amount of money there should not be a 4.5-year wait to see a specialist. And please remember, that's NOT government money — it's YOUR money, paid for by YOUR tax dollars.

Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and American Senator Bernie Sanders talk about Canadian health care at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ont. on Oct. 29, 2017.

So what can be done? The Canadian public should not have to put up with such flagrant mismanagement of OUR tax dollars. It's well past the time to ask good hard questions of our leaders and ask them why they cannot manage the health system properly.

Unfortunately, of course, what politicians usually do is simply throw money at the problem. A good example is in Ontario, where months before an election Health Minister Eric Hoskins has thrown money at hospitals, on a temporary basis (guess what happens after the election) rather than fix the underlying issues facing health care.

The first thing politicians need to do is to acknowledge that there is a problem. Look, I get that that the primary goal of politicians is to get elected. That's why Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne tweeted out how happy U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders was with our one payer system. (BTW when he came to Canada — do you think she showed him a newly renovated hospital, or did she show a hospital like the one in Brampton, where patients admitted to hospital lie for days in stretchers?) But at some point, politicians like her need to admit that the system is broken.

Our health care isn't perfect, but I was proud to tell @SenSanders about prescription coverage for kids with OHIP+ https://t.co/kUaX84aDXC — Kathleen Wynne (@Kathleen_Wynne) November 2, 2017

The next step is to make a commitment to work with front-line health-care workers. In Ontario, that hasn't happened for years. The relationship with physicians and the Ontario government in particular is currently at the lowest levels since the David Peterson government of the mid 1980s. Yet it's precisely the front-line health-care workers that know where the flaws and inefficiencies are. It's time for governments to connect with them in a true meaningful way and empower them to help fix the problems in health care.

Politicians also need to stop cherry picking reports. I wrote recently of how Ontario introduced the flawed Patients First Act, rather than implement the full findings of the Price-Baker report. Wynne's goal was clearly to pick the recommendations that allowed her to bury the scandal plagued CCACs. Politicians need to have the guts to implement the FULL reports they get, instead of only picking politically expedient recommendations.

We deserve much better health care than we are getting.

Finally, it needs to be repeated that there are simply too many health-care organizations funded by the government. Politicians have been talking about ""health-care silos"" for decades and have failed to do anything to address it. Silos refer to the fact that each health-care organization (whether a hospital, your family doctors office, public health, home care, etc.) work independently, with their own software, data and information, and simply don't share information enough to provide optimal patient care. Nine YEARS after piloting information sharing via electronic records, my area of Georgian Bay remains virtually the only one in Ontario to do so.

One thing that is undeniably certain after reading the #CanadaWAITS tweets: we deserve much better health care than we are getting. Will this campaign be enough to convince politicians to do the right thing, and take a good long look at what's needed to transform the health-care system? For the sake of Canadians, I certainly hope so.

A Madrid High Court judge asked Belgium to arrest Puigdemont and four associates after they ignored a court order to return to Spain on Thursday to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

The judge rejected a request from the former Catalan leader, who is considering standing in a snap election in Catalonia next month, to testify via video conference from Belgium.

Puigdemont has said he did not trust Spanish justice but would cooperate with the Belgian courts. Belgium will have a maximum of three months to decide whether to send him back to Spain.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont's sacked cabinet were ordered by the High Court to be held in custody pending an investigation and potential trial.

Dismissed Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont has called for ""democratic opposition"".

""We consider ourselves a legitimate government,"" Puigdemont told Belgian state television RTBF on Friday. ""There must be a continuity to tell the world what's going on in Spain... It's not with a government in jail that the elections will be neutral, independent, normal.""

""...I am ready to be a candidate... it's possible to run a campaign from anywhere,"" he added, referring to the election called by authorities in Madrid when Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took over Catalonia.

In protest at the jailings, Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural -- whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 .

Another six Catalan leaders are due to testify on Nov. 9 on the same charges.

One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,300) on Friday. The other eight were not given bail and could remain in custody for up to four years.

Protesters hold signs reading 'Freedom to political prisoners' during a demonstration in Barcelona.

Vila stepped down from the Catalan cabinet before Friday's independence declaration, and while he remains a supporter of an secession he has been advocating a negotiated solution with the central government.

He has said he wanted to stand as the leading candidate for Puigdemont's PdeCat (Catalan Democratic party) in the regional election.

NEW BOOST

The detention of the secessionist leaders and Puigdemont's flight to Belgium have given a new boost to the secessionist camp after cracks appeared in its ranks.

Thousands of people staged pro-independence protests on Thursday night in several Catalan towns, and parties forming the current coalition Junts Pel Si (Together For Yes) are pushing to run again on a joint ticket at the Dec. 21 election.

An opinion poll published on Tuesday showed Junts Pel Si would win the December election with 35.2 percent if the vote was held today and would likely reach a parliamentary majority if it stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

Former members of the Catalan Government attended Spain's National High Court.

Facing such a prospect, the Spanish government said on Friday it would have no option but to open talks within the law with those who held a majority.

""We could offer a new dialogue so that we can fulfill Catalans' aspirations for more autonomy and look into reforming the constitution,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Alfonso Dastis told French newspaper Le Figaro in an interview.

""Some even mention the idea of a federal model so that regions can have more autonomy, including financially.""

Inizia così il racconto fatto dall'ex presidente di Emergency Cecilia Strada, figlia di Gino, sulle molestie subite quando era bambina. Strada, su Facebook, ricorda il caso collegandosi all'ormai lunga scia di denunce fatte da donne dopo il caso Weinstein scoppiato negli Stati Uniti.

""Il mondo era ancora un posto senza cellulari e si chiamava sul telefono di casa: ""C'è la mamma? C'è il papà?"". Sono a lavorare, dico al signore all'altro capo del filo: quaranta o cinquant'anni più di me, importante e stimato professionista, amico di papà. ""Quindi sei sola a casa?"". Qualcosa nel suo tono non mi torna. La me stessa di trent'anni più vecchia dice ""metti giù"". La me stessa di nove anni dice ""sì"""", racconta l'ex presidente di Emergency.

""E come sei vestita?"". Il suo tono mi torna sempre meno, ma sono imbarazzata, è un uomo adulto, è un amico di papà, la mamma mi ha insegnato a essere sempre gentile, glielo dico. Ho i jeans e la maglietta. ""E le mutandine? Di che colore sono le mutandine?"". La trentanovenne ora strilla ""Metti giù! Mandalo affanculo - metti giù - chiama la mamma!"". La novenne si sente gelata di vergogna, ma che cosa posso fare per uscire da questa situazione? Per chiudere prima possibile, ma senza essere maleducata, perché mi hanno insegnato ad essere sempre educata, e comunque questo è un adulto, mi ripeto, un amico di papà, non posso mica mettere giù. Anche se sono fredda gelata e adesso ho anche un po' paura. Dico ""Non mi ricordo"". ""Allora guarda. Metti una mano nei jeans e guarda di che colore sono"". Non lo voglio fare. È tutto sbagliato. Non so come uscirne. Improvviso: ""Non posso farlo. Perché... - la trentanovenne: perché sei un porco pedofilo di merda, ecco perché! - perché sono troppo stretti"", dico.

Il racconto però continua: """"Mi piacciono i jeans stretti"", fa lui - la trentanovenne urla ""Cretina! Bella improvvisazione! Allora potevi anche dirgli scusa-ma-sto-facendo-merenda-con-una-bella-banana!"". Lui va avanti: ""se sono così stretti devi tirarli giù, per guardare bene"". A quel punto divento un blocco di pietra"", prosegue Strada.

""Una sensazione fisica: mi sento tutta dura, fredda. Un unico blocco. Di pietra. Dico ""No, non posso"". Insiste"".

Insisto anch'io: ""No, non posso, sono troppo stretti per tirarmeli giù"". Mi attacco alla mia improbabile scusa, mi rendo conto che è assurda, ma la ripeto e la ripeto, insisto. No. Dopo un po' desiste, saluta, mette giù. Rimango per un'ora seduta per terra vicino al telefono, sentendomi schifosa. La trentanovenne mi dice: ""Lo sai che tu non hai fatto niente, vero? Ha fatto tutto lui"". Ma io mi sento uno schifo. Per quel che mi ha detto e anche - la cosa più assurda - perché sono stata maleducata con lui. Mi sento uno schifo e ho paura di dirlo alla mamma. Ho paura, non so di che cosa ma ho paura. Ho paura che papà lo ammazzi se glielo dico, contemporaneamente ho paura che risponda ""non è possibile, non è successo davvero"". Anche a me sembra impossibile, è successo davvero? Sì.

Ci ho messo parecchie settimane - parecchie settimane in cui morivo di vergogna ogni volta che squillava il telefono e mi infilavo in bagno per non dover rispondere - per decidere di dirlo a un amico della mamma e poi, insieme a lui, dirlo alla mamma. Non so che cosa abbiano fatto, ma il tizio non ha più telefonato a casa mia. Qualche anno dopo è morto. E mi spiace aver perso l'occasione di chiamarlo finché ne avevo il tempo, per fargli fare due chiacchiere con la me stessa grande. ""Sono quella che aveva nove anni quando volevi guardare le sue mutandine. Che mi dici ora?"". Magari sarebbe rimasto impietrito di vergogna, come me allora, la cornetta in mano.

Ardern is in Sydney for a whirlwind visit after being elected New Zealand PM in October. The brief stop in Australia is the Labour leader's first overseas trip as Prime Minister.

Turnbull and Ardern met on Sunday morning at Kirribili House where they discussed a range of bilateral issues including terrorism, regional security, trade, North Korea and the crisis on Manus Island.

Addressing media after the meeting, Turnbull said the federal government would not take up New Zealand's offer to take 150 asylum seekers currently in PNG and Nauru.

""We thank New Zealand for making an offer, we are not taking it up at this time,"" Turnbull said.

.@TurnbullMalcolm says he appreciates NZs offer to take 150 refugees, but will be pursuing the US settlement deal https://t.co/mkJkNUFPPB pic.twitter.com/ZML7HhV9bJ November 5, 2017

Turnbull said while he appreciated New Zealand's offer his government would prioritise its existing refugee deal with the US. Under that agreement, 1,250 refugees from the two Pacific nations will be resettled in the US.

Ardern said the offer, originally made by her predecessor John Key, still stood.

""I did renewed New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru ... It is a very genuine offer,"" she said.

""From the perspective of New Zealand we want our offer to stay on the table so we can assist as much as we are able.""

The comments come as roughly 600 asylum seekers on Manus Island remain without power, food and water in an attempt by authorities to encourage them to seek refuge on the island.

The situation emerged after the controversial PNG detention facility was shut down this week.

The crisis has escalated to the point where the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has labelled it an unfolding humanitarian crisis.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten has previously urged Turnbull to take up the deal, saying that it would not put ""people smugglers back in business"".",Turnbull Knocks Back New Zealand's Refugee Offer,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/04/turnbull-knocks-back-new-zealands-refugee-offer_a_23267001/

Meeting minutes and confidential information notes which EWN has seen reveal Mbalula:

believes Crime Intelligence officers are illegally spying on him and carrying out a campaign to discredit him;

has ordered several promotions of generals be rescinded, and another general's transfer out of the unit;

receives weekly intelligence briefings from the head of the unit;

has been added to the police's daily intelligence briefing mailing list; and

issues instructions directly to the head of Crime Intelligence, bypassing the acting national commissioner.

ARABIE SAOUDITE - Des dizaines de princes, de ministres (anciens et actuels) et d'hommes d'affaires, ont été arrêtés samedi 4 novembre dans la soirée en Arabie saoudite, selon des médias, au cours d'une purge sans précédent qui doit permettre au jeune prince héritier de consolider son pouvoir.

Parallèlement, Metab ben Abdallah, chef de la puissante Garde nationale saoudienne, un temps considéré comme prétendant au trône, ainsi que le chef de la Marine Abdallah Al-Sultan et le ministre de l'Économie Adel Fakih ont été abruptement limogés dans le cadre de cette purge sans précédent.

Ces arrestations et limogeages sont intervenus quelques heures après la création, par décret royal, d'une commission anticorruption dirigée par le prince héritier et homme fort du royaume ultra-conservateur, Mohammed ben Salmane, âgé de 32 ans et surnomé ""MBS"".

Des avions privés cloués au sol

Selon la chaîne satellitaire Al-Arabiya, à capitaux saoudiens, onze princes, quatre ministres et des dizaines d'anciens ministres ont été arrêtés alors que la commission a lancé une enquête sur les inondations qui ont dévasté en 2009 la ville portuaire de Jeddah (ouest), sur la mer Rouge, à la suite de pluies torrentielles, faisant une centaine de morts.

L'agence de presse officielle saoudienne SPA a indiqué que le but de la commission était de ""préserver l'argent public, punir les personnes corrompues et ceux qui profitent de leur position"". Le conseil des religieux a rapidement réagi sur son compte Twitter en affirmant que la lutte contre la corruption était ""aussi importante que le combat contre le terrorisme"".

Le royaume ouvre une nouvelle ère et une politique de transparence"" Mohammed al-Jadaan, ministre des finances saoudien

Parmi les personnes arrêtées figure le prince et milliardaire Al-Walid ben Talal, selon des sites web saoudiens. Cette information n'a pas été confirmée officiellement.

Une source aéroportuaire a par ailleurs indiqué à l'AFP que les forces de sécurité avaient cloué au sol des avions privés à Jeddah, pour empêcher que certaines personnalités quittent le territoire.

Avec ces arrestations, ""le royaume ouvre une nouvelle ère et une politique de transparence, de clarté et de responsabilité"", a déclaré dimanche le ministre des Finances Mohammed al-Jadaan, ajoutant que ces actions ""décisives préserveront le climat pour les investissements et renforceront la confiance dans l'État de droit"".

Étouffer les contestations internes

""L'étendue et l'ampleur de ces arrestations semblent être sans précédent dans l'histoire moderne de l'Arabie saoudite"", a affirmé à l'AFP Kristian Ulrichsen, spécialiste du Golfe à l'institut Baker de l'université Rice, aux États-Unis.

""Si la détention du prince Al-Walid ben Talal se confirme, elle constituera une onde de choc sur le plan intérieur et dans le monde des affaires internationales"", estime cet expert. Le cours de la société internationale d'investissement du prince, Kingdom Holding Company, a chuté de 9,9% à l'ouverture dimanche.

L'indice Tadawul All-Shares (Tasi), la Bourse la plus importante des pays arabes, était également en baisse, de 1,6%, une minute seulement après son ouverture, à la suite de la vague d'arrestations.

Contrôlant les principaux leviers du gouvernement, de la défense à l'économie, Mohammed ben Salmane semble chercher à étouffer les contestations internes avant tout transfert formel du pouvoir par son père, le roi Salmane, âgé de 81 ans.

Fin octobre, MBS, issu de la jeune génération princière saoudienne, a promis une Arabie ""modérée"", en rupture avec l'image d'un pays longtemps considéré comme l'exportateur du wahhabisme, une version rigoriste de l'islam qui a nourri nombre de jihadistes à travers le monde. ""Nous n'allons pas passer 30 ans de plus de notre vie à nous accommoder d'idées extrémistes et nous allons les détruire maintenant"", avait-il assuré sous les applaudissements des participants à un forum économique baptisé le ""Davos dans le désert"" qui avait attiré 2500 décideurs du monde entier.

Une vague d'arrestations de dissidents en septembre

Il a lancé plusieurs chantiers de réformes -droit de conduire pour les femmes et ouvertures de cinémas notamment- qui marquent le plus grand bouleversement culturel et économique de l'histoire moderne du royaume, avec une marginalisation de fait de la caste des religieux conservateurs.

Dans le même temps, il a oeuvré pour renforcer son emprise politique sur le pouvoir, procédant notamment en septembre à une vague d'arrestations de dissidents, dont des religieux influents et des intellectuels.

Selon des analystes, nombre de ces dissidents critiquaient la politique étrangère musclée du jeune prince héritier, comme le boycott du Qatar, ainsi que certaines réformes comme la privatisation d'entreprises publiques et la réduction des subventions de l'État.

Πολλές εκφράσεις της φύσης είναι αυτούσιες στα δημιουργήματα μου όπως καρποί από δέντρα ή κάποια χαρακτηριστικά ελληνικών δέντρων και κάποια έντομα με συμβολικό χαρακτήρα όπως οι μέλισσες και τα τζιτζίκια.

Ποια μερίδα αγοραστών τα προτιμά συνήθως;

Η σύγχρονη γυναίκα με πολλαπλούς ρόλους στην ζωή και στην ψυχή της είναι ο συνομιλητής μου όταν σχεδιάζω. Θέλω να φοράει κοσμήματα και τις τσάντες μου από το πρωί σε επαγγελματικά ραντεβού μέχρι το απόγευμα σε κάποιο aperitivo ή και βραδινό φαγητό. Θέλω να αισθάνεται ότι έχοντας ντυθεί απλά, μπορεί να εκφράσει το στυλ της με αυτά τα χαρακτηριστικά αξεσουάρ που είναι από μόνα τους έντονα σε προσωπικότητα και αίσθηση. Φέτος παρουσιάσαμε και μαγιό που έχουν συνέπεια σαν στυλ στο DNA μας, μονοσήμαντα με διαχρονικό χαρακτήρα, διακοσμούνται με τις αλυσίδες ορόσημο του brand όπως και οι τσάντες μας.

Τι ήταν αυτό που σε οδήγησε να ασχοληθείς με το κόσμημα;

Έκανα την πρώτη μου εμφάνιση στο χώρο του κοσμήματος το 2009 με την επωνυμία της εταιρείας μου «my eye for design""», «myi4d». Από μικρή ήθελα να κάνω γλυπτική και δοκίμασα στο Slade School of Art ένα εντατικό summer course όταν ήμουν 22 χρονών και είδα ότι θέλω να συνδυάζω πάντα και την εμπορικη ανταπόκριση ή μάλλον να μπορώ να αισθάνομαι άμεσα την απήχηση του κοινού στις δημιουργίες μου, το οποίο γίνεται άμεσα στις πωλήσεις προϊόντων και όχι τόσο στα έργα τέχνης.

Είχα πάρει μαθήματα αργυροχρυσοχοΐας 4 καλοκαίρια στη σειρά τότε γιατί έβλεπα το κόσμημα σαν ευκαιρία έκφρασης του πάθους μου για την γλυπτική και μετά πήρα παράλληλα με το Master in business που σπούδαζα στο Μιλάνο, παρακολούθησα ένα χρόνο μαθήματα κατασκευής κοσμημάτων εκεί και κατάλαβα πόσο ήθελα να το συνεχίσω αυτό.

Βέβαια ιστορικά όταν το 2008 ήρθε η παγκόσμια κρίση και έστειλα τη συλλογή αντικών μου πίσω στην Αμερική τότε ήρθε και πρακτικά η ανάγκη να έχω στη γκαλερί στην Αθήνα κάποιο προϊόν με τιμή κάτω των 500 ευρώ και πέρα από τη γκάμα έργων τέχνης και αντικών, οπότε έτσι ξεκίνησε η σειρά με κοσμήματα και είδη δώρων. Με τα χρόνια τα δώρα έγιναν με μέση τιμή 80 ευρώ και έτσι δημιούργησα χειροποίητα κοσμήματα που ήθελα να ειναι μπρούτζινα επίχρυσα για να καλύψω αυτό το κενό στη γκαλερί μου και τελικά ξεκίνησα πιο μαζικά τη τάση στην Ελλάδα πρίν 16 χρόνια για ποιοτικά χειροποίητα γλυπτά - κοσμήματα χωρίς πέτρες.

Παρουσιάζουμε πρώτη φορά συλλογή απο δερμάτινες τσάντες που μόλις έγιναν διαθέσιμες αυτή την εποχή και γι' αυτό σκέφτηκα να τις παρουσιάσουμε στο ""The Pop up Project"" στο Golden Hall, απο τις 20 Οκτωβρίου μέχρι τις 11 Νοεμβρίου ώστε να υπάρχει χρόνος για το ελληνικό κοινό να μας γνωρίσει μέσα απο ενα άλλο καινούριο προϊόν αφού πέρσι παρουσίασαμε με επιτυχία τις πλεχτές αδιάβροχες τσάντες.

Η καινοτομία που αναφέρεις στις πλεκτές τσάντες είναι ότι είναι αδιάβροχες;

Γεγονός είναι ότι διεθνώς δεν έχουμε δει ακόμα άλλες χειροποίητα πλεχτές τσάντες διακοσμημένες με κοσμήματα ή περίτεχνα πλεγμένες αλυσίδες οι οποίες να είναι ταυτόχρονα αδιάβροχες. Αυτό τις κάνει πολύ ανθεκτικές, εύκολες στο καθάρισμα, ελαφριές και φυσικά τους ανοίγει τη κατηγορία all weather που καλύπτει πολλές χώρες με υγρό κλίμα και στην Ελλάδα αποτελούν μια ιδανική χειμερινή πρόταση σε αντίθεση με άλλες πλεκτές που δεν έχουν αυτά τα σημαντικά πλεονεκτήματα. Γι' αυτό έχουμε την ευκαιρία να της πουλάμε σε γνωστή αλυσίδα καταστημάτων στην Αμερική την ""Αnthropologie"".



Μίλησε μας για την έμπνευση της συλλογής σου με τις δερμάτινες τσάντες.



Ήθελα να προσφερω πολύ καλής ποιότητας δερμάτινες τσάντες, ανθεκτικές και λιτές που να φοριούνται όλη τη μέρα και αφιερώσαμε κάποια ειδικά σχέδια σε εκλεπτυσμένες τσάντες εργασίας. Σίγουρα το πλεονέκτημά μας στην ποιότητα στο χρόνο είναι ότι έχουν διπλή επένδυση δέρματος, πέρα απο τη κατασκευή τους.

Σε επίπεδο έμπνευσης συμπορεύονται με τα διαχρονικά μας θέματα. Άλλες τσάντες είναι διακοσμημένες με το γνωστό από τη συλλογή κοσμημάτων μας σύμβολο wishbone ή αλλιώς ""γιάντες"" και άλλες με κάποιο χαρακτηριστικό κόσμημα απο τις 3 θεματικές ενότητες που πιστά ακολουθώ τα τελευταία 13 χρόνια: τα κόκκαλα, τη δαντέλα και τους σπόρους/στοιχεία φύσης.

In lieu of endorsing weight-loss teas and hitting every D-list red carpet going - choices that Camilla is careful not to judge or look down on, we should add - she headed straight to Greece with former co-star Jamie Jewitt, to lend her hand to helping refugees. She later joined the cast of HuffPost UK original series ‘New Activists’, documenting her recent trip to the site of the former jungle camp in Calais, alongside Help Refugees.

HuffPost UK Camilla Thurlow

HuffPost UK recently caught up with the former bomb disposal worker about how ‘New Activists’ felt the like the right fit for her, why the refugee crisis means so much and what it’s like breaking the reality TV star mould... What made you want to get involved with ‘New Activists’? Having seen the other ‘New Activists’ and what they’d been working on, you could see that it was really opening people’s eyes to a whole different side of activism. Like, it was humanising the people involved. In some instances there’s been a bit of a stigma attached to activism, and people would consider activists to be only a certain type of person. But actually this documentary series has really given an insight into the fact it’s just about normal people who feel very strongly, and there’s so many different sides to that person. It’s all about big ideas but with very real people. People know you best from ‘Love Island’, and after being on a show like that, you get a lot of offers. How did you decide what to do next? I think it’s all about authenticity, really, on that side of things, and I know what I think I’m good at, and it tends to be stuff that I feel passionately about. If I’m going to do something, I like to do it justice. For me it was just important to find the right thing, and also to try and make sure that I was using any platform that I might have to raise awareness for certain issues that I don’t think necessarily always get seen. It’s that thing, interestingly, of different horses for different courses. I have so much admiration for the other things that people have done, and this seemed like the right opportunity for me. On ‘Love Island’, we saw how much you wanted to do more activism. Did you ever worry that being on a show like that would limit your options? Of course there were concerns in my mind in terms of going back to the work that I did before, and I think obviously it’s always worth having those concerns and having a healthy level of worry about what you’re going to do next, because it makes you stay on the right track. So I guess I was worried to an extent, but I think it was the same for all of us who were in it from the beginning. When we came out we just didn’t realise how successful the series had been, and how successful it had been across so many different demographics. It was really a very diverse audience and… I think there was definitely something in the timing, this summer was quite an interesting time on many different levels with domestic and foreign politics, and somehow in that. ‘Love Island’ became this really engaging escapism. So I’ll say that I did have concerns, but in the same way I would have had concerns about many different things and how that could affect my work.

ITV Camilla and her 'Love Island' co-stars this summer

Do you hope that your involvement in ‘Love Island’ and ‘New Activists’ can possibly inspire a new breed of celebrities who start on reality shows? I think the thing is, it’s really interesting because I feel like there are comparisons being drawn that aren’t as clear as it might appear. I don’t feel as different [to other reality stars] as sometimes people perceive it. I’m struggling to explain myself, but I think it’s very easy to label someone as a “typical reality TV star” but that person will have many other sides to them. The only thing that I sort of hope will happen is that... if I can raise any awareness of the issues that are important to me, that will make me very happy. What is it about the refugee crisis in particular that spoke to you? I think part of it comes from my previous work, pre- ‘Love Island’. When you go to an area where there’s been a conflict and you can see people have been forced to leave their homes behind, and then you’re involved in trying to make the area safe so they can come back… you start to think about what it must mean for that person. To have literally got to a point where they had no choice but to leave, but also what growing up against that backdrop of violence can do to a person. Also, because I was on the EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] side, I wasn’t seeing much of the people who had been forced to leave, so it was really important to me to build up that whole picture of what the results of conflict are. So, I initially took the trip to Greece with Jamie [Jewitt, her boyfriend and fellow ‘Love Island’ star] and that was certainly an eye-opener, from that point on we just realised how much we could be doing to help people, and i just wanted to be a part of that. So how did your trip to Calais come about? I spoke to Josie [Naughton], who’s the co-founder of Help Refugees about supporting them. It’s been a year since the demolition of the Jungle camp in Calais, and since then, people have been homeless, living rough - not that they had homes before, but there was some form of camp, some form of protection, and they are now completely exposed. And that includes a number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping rough, completely unprotected, no one to stop anything happening to them. The more I discussed it with her, the more I realised first of all that I needed to see it for myself, and secondly that I wanted to be a part of trying to highlight the fact that there is a legal route for these children to come here, there is a safe way and that needs to happen urgently. Especially now it’s coming up to winter. In the year since the jungle camp closed, how has the situation in Calais changed? I think it’s worse, for the people who are there at the moment. It would be wrong for me to draw any sort of straight of judgement, because I didn’t see it before. But we spoke to a gentleman called Stu in the distribution centre, and he had been in the jungle camp, and he said for him the conditions are worse. Now, they’re not even allowed tents to sleep in, so now they get a sleeping bag and a blanket at best, and even those are often taken away by the police, so the conditions are really really bad. In terms of keeping track of people, in making sure that they haven’t been hurt or harmed, that they haven’t attempted to cross and then not made it back and they’re stranded somewhere on their own, it’s just so much harder when there’s no formalised systems.

Kaling confirmed last month that she's having a baby girl. During an appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" the mom-to-be admitted she wanted to know the gender of her child ""way early.""

However, the father of her child is still unknown. When the actress' pregnancy news broke in July, a source revealed to People magazine, ""She's not telling anyone — not even close friends — who the father is.""

Despite this (and her nerves), the actress is excited to become a mom.

In a previous interview with ""The Today Show,"" Kaling revealed what kind of mom she hopes to be. ""Right now, I just feel so anxious,"" she said. ""But I'd like to be the fun mom. I know I'm gonna be the dorky mom, so it could be kind of fun, too. I think that would be nice.""

Eczema

One of the most common skin conditions in the world, eczema (also known as dermatitis) is infamous for its itchy symptoms. Dr Adrian Lim, dermatologist and Clinical Senior Lecturer at the University of Sydney said that eczema can impact from as early as the first few months of a baby's life.

Acne

The skin condition that sends shivers down the spine of every teenager, acne is a disease that can be very debilitating if left untreated.

Vitiligo

A condition which alters the colours in your skin, vitiligo is relatively uncommon. However, dermatologists are at the forefront of innovation in skin treatments and can help with these rarer conditions as well as more common ones.

Alopecia

A common term for hair loss, Dr Brad McKay explained that alopecia has links to other skin conditions, such as eczema.

Rosacea

The medical term for when the skin turns red after you drink a glass of red or feel flush after a spicy meal. Rosacea can strike at any time.

Urticaria

Also known as hives, the condition urticaria can affect anyone, and is extremely uncomfortable.

Athlete's Foot

We know now that these were trolls working on behalf of the Russian government. Without knowing, we laughed or scowled at their jokes. We mocked or cheered their opinions. We looked at their photos and watched their videos, and few if any of us batted an eye as they covertly shaped the way we looked at our own country.

The accounts have all since been deleted, but I decided to Google more than 1,000 of them to find out just how often and in what ways they were able to embed themselves in the work of U.S. news organizations. The vast majority that I checked never made it into stories, but more than 20 did in myriad ways and in all types of organizations.

This was hardly an infiltration. We, the media, practically let the trolls in the front door. Thanks to the cockeyed incentives of online publishing, all they had to do was knock.

Writer Jacques Pauw's lawyers have hit back at the State Security Agency (SSA), saying its threat of court action over the controversial book ""The President's Keepers"" is ""incongruous"" and ""serves no rational purpose"".

Representing Pauw and NB Publishers, Willem de Klerk Attorneys has issued a letter stating that the SSA order can neither stop the distribution or withdrawal of the book nor the retraction of any of its content.

This comes after the SSA on Friday issued the publishers with a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the book be withdrawn and parts of it be retracted. The SSA also threatened criminal charges.

READ: 'This Is Why The SSA Wants Jacques Pauw's Zuma Book Gone'

""[The SSA's] generalised statement that the book is replete with inaccuracies is not backed up by a single reference to any specific statement in the book that is alleged to be inaccurate. Your demand for a retraction of all those parts which are inaccurate is therefore incongruous,"" Willem de Klerk Attorneys wrote in the letter.

""It is furthermore unclear how you reconcile an allegation of falsity, on the one hand, with an alleged violation of statutory provisions on the other. Publication of the information contained in the book does not violate the relevant intelligence statutes as you allege.""

The law firm maintained the information contained in the book was true and of undeniable public interest.

""There can be no basis for an urgent court application to prevent the further distribution of the book. Your client waited the best part of a week before making its demand, and then set a five-day deadline for response,"" the firm wrote.

""Any attempt by the State Security Agency to prevent the further dissemination of the book would serve no rational purpose. As you will be aware, courts do not, as a matter of policy, make orders which do not serve a purpose or to which effect cannot be given.""

They said if the SSA proceeded with a court application, Pauw and NB Publishers would oppose it.

Meanwhile, the South African Revenue Service has said it is also seeking legal advice on possible criminal and civil investigations into Pauw and the Sunday Times, the newspaper in which excerpts from ""The President's Keepers"" were published exclusively, for allegedly ""unlawfully"" disclosing ""confidential taxpayer information"".",Lawyers Respond To SSA About Zuma Book: 'You Don't Have A Case',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/06/lawyers-respond-to-ssa-about-zuma-book-you-dont-have-a-case_a_23267900/

Die belgische Justiz hat nun 60 Tage Zeit, über die Auslieferung zu entscheiden

Der abgesetzte katalanische Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont hat sich in Belgien den Behörden gestellt. Dies bestätigte die Staatsanwaltschaft in Brüssel am Sonntag. Die Regierung in Madrid hatte einen Europäischen Fahndungs- und Haftbefehl gegen den 54-Jährigen sowie vier Ex-Minister der Regionalregierung erlassen, die sich nach Brüssel abgesetzt hatten.

Die fünf Katalanen sollten noch am Sonntag einem Untersuchungsrichter vorgeführt werden. Dieser habe dann bis Montagmorgen Zeit zu entscheiden, ob die Beschuldigten festgehalten werden. Spätester Zeitpunkt sei 9.17 Uhr am Montagmorgen, sagte ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft auf einer Pressekonferenz in Brüssel am Sonntagnachmittag.

Das weitere rechtliche Prozedere könnte sich über Wochen hinziehen: Wird der Haftbefehl aufrecht erhalten, hat das Gericht dann weitere 15 Tage Zeit, über eine Abschiebung zu entscheiden.

Belgische Justiz hat 60 Tage Zeit, über Auslieferung zu entscheiden

Sowohl die Staatsanwaltschaft als auch die betroffenen Personen können dann Einspruch einlegen. Über den Einspruch muss ebenfalls binnen 15 Tagen entschieden werden. Ein weiterer Einspruch beim belgischen Revisionsgericht ist möglich.

Nach den EU-Regeln hat die belgische Justiz 60 Tage Zeit, über die Auslieferung zu entscheiden - lediglich in Ausnahmefällen kann die Frist um weitere 30 Tage verlängert werden.

Puigdemont und seinen Mitstreitern drohen in Spanien lange Haftstrafen. Ihnen werden von der Justiz Rebellion, Auflehnung gegen die Staatsgewalt und Unterschlagung öffentlicher Gelder vorgeworfen. Grund dafür ist die einseitige Unabhängigkeitserklärung, die das katalanische Parlament am Freitag vor einer Woche beschlossen hatte.

Die Zentralregierung von Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy hatte die katalanische Regierung daraufhin abgesetzt. Die wirtschaftsstarke Region im Nordosten Spaniens steht nun unter Zwangsverwaltung aus Madrid. Für den 21. Dezember setzte Rajoy Neuwahlen an.

Puigdemont war bereits vor der Anklageerhebung nach Brüssel ausgereist.

S'il a rapidement endossé - à sa manière, cela va sans dire - le rôle de président, on ne peut pas en dire autant de Melania Trump et de son rôle de première dame. L'installation de Melania Trump à la Maison Blanche s'est faite lentement, au sens propre comme au figuré. L'épouse du 45e président des Etats-Unis, officiellement investi le 20 janvier, a en effet emménagé dans le palais présidentiel seulement le 11 juin dernier, soit six mois plus tard.



Cette décision - tardive - a mis fin aux rumeurs de mésentente dans le couple. Officiellement, la raison invoquée était de ménager leur jeune fils, Baron, qui aurait été perturbé de changer d'établissement scolaire. Sitôt arrivée à la Maison-Blanche, ""Flotus"" (""First Lady Of The United States"") s'est empressée de tweeter ""J'ai hâte de créer des souvenirs dans notre nouvelle maison!"".

Looking forward to the memories we'll make in our new home! #Movingday pic.twitter.com/R5DtdV1Hnv — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) 12 juin 2017

Sauf que, malgré son installation à Washington et une plutôt bonne cote de popularité dans ce récent sondage, Melania Trump semble encore avoir du mal à trouver sa place. Et jusqu'à présent, les ""souvenirs dans la nouvelle maison"" rentrent principalement dans la case mauvais souvenirs.

Cible de moqueries

On ne compte en effet plus les occasions où la première dame a été la cible de moqueries, et ce pas toujours à cause de son fait. Un exemple récent: ce dîner à la Maison Blanche, en marge de l'Assemblée générale de l'ONU, qui a mal tourné.

La troisième épouse de Trump avait en effet mis les petits plats dans les grands. Autour de la table: une centaine de conjoints et conjointes de dirigeants du monde. Melania Trump avait préparé un rare discours, pétri de bons sentiments. Thème consensuel choisi: la protection des enfants. ""Nous devons enseigner à nos enfants les valeurs de l'empathie et de la communication qui sont au cœur de la gentillesse, la conscience, l'intégrité et le leadership, qui ne peuvent être enseignés que par l'exemple"", a déclaré l'ex-mannequin de 47 ans d'origine slovène.

""J'espère que vous partagerez mon engagement à enseigner à la prochaine génération de suivre la règle d'or: 'Traitez les autres comme vous voudriez qu'ils vous traitent' (...) Nous devons nous concentrer sur le message et le contenu auxquels ils sont exposés quotidiennement via les réseaux sociaux, les intimidations qu'ils subissent en ligne ou en personne"", a-t-elle déclaré.

Sur les réseaux sociaux les réactions négatives ont été immédiates, et les internautes n'ont pas manqué de rappeler les entorses de son mari à cette règle d'or. ""Elle ne peut pas parler sérieusement. Melania, rentre chez toi et tiens ce discours à ton MARI"", a notamment réagi Charles Blow, un éditorialiste du NY Times.

Melania's speech at the UN has to be a joke. HAS TO BE! She CANNOT be serious. Melanie, go home and give this speech to your HUSBAND!!! — Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) 20 septembre 2017

Autre exemple - qui tient plus de sa propre maladresse cette fois - à la fin du mois d'août. Melania Trump a encore déclenché des railleries d'internautes en sortant de la Maison Blanche en talons aiguilles et lunettes d'aviateur, pour se rendre au Texas, victime d'inondations catastrophiques provoquées par l'ouragan Harvey. Plusieurs d'entre eux l'ont comparée à la reine de France Marie-Antoinette, allant même jusqu'à la rebaptiser ""Melania Antoinette"", qui avait rétorqué ""Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"" après avoir été informée que le peuple n'avait plus de pain à manger.

Et même lorsqu'elle tente de faire preuve de générosité, son geste est balayé d'un revers de main. Au mois de septembre, Melania Trump a fait une donation de livres pour enfants écrits par Dr. Seuss, célèbre illustrateur américain, dans tout le pays, afin de célébrer le jour national de la lecture, rapporte CNN. Mais une libraire du Massachussetts a refusé le cadeau.

Dans une lettre ouverte publiée sur son blog, Liz Phipps Soeiro explique: ""Mes étudiants sont impressionnés par les magnifiques ex-libris avec votre nom et le tampon indélébile de la Maison Blanche. Cependant, nous ne conserverons pas ces livres dans notre collection. Vous n'êtes peut-être pas au courant, mais Dr Seuss est un cliché vieillissant de la littérature enfantine. (...) Les illustrations de cet auteur tendent vers la propagande raciste, les caricatures et les stéréotypes nocifs"".

Tous ces paramètres mis bout à bout ne facilitent pas la tâche de celle qui, depuis janvier, a bien du mal à assumer les fonctions habituellement dévolues à l'épouse du locataire de la Maison Blanche. Mais être la cible de moqueries semble incomber au statut - non officiel - de Première dame. Et même la très appréciée Michelle Obama avait été critiquée en 2009, dont la pose pour son portrait officiel avait été jugée ""trop détendue"" par certains commentateurs, rappelle Madame Le Figaro. Ainsi, Nancy Reagan affirmait, des années après avoir quitté ce rôle:

""Rien, mais absolument rien, ne vous prépare à être ""First Lady"". Tout ce que je disais ou faisais, en tant que ""First Lady"", épouse ou mère, était instantanément matière à critique, interprétation, seconde interprétation. Mes habits. Mes amis. Mes goûts. Ma relation avec mes enfants. La manière dont je regardais mon mari..."", relatent Les Inrocks.

Ce n'est pas Melania Trump qui la contredirait.

Second albums are a notoriously tricky hurdle for a lot of artists, particularly when their first offering has received critical or commercial success, as it’s often seen by music-lovers as a sink or swim situation.

With Sam already a polarising figure within the industry, will ‘The Thrill Of It’ cement his place as one to watch within the music world?

Well, the first reviews for his latest offering are out, and while many have pointed out the obvious similarities to ‘In The Lonely Hour’, the jury’s still out as to whether or not that’s a good thing...

“It’s tempting to read the album’s title ironically, but for as pained as Smith sounds, he’s also engaged and alive, channeling his demons into songs that are immediately welcoming, warm, and soulful.

“That isn’t to say that the album’s conservatism doesn’t leave some questions about where Smith’s headed. He’s deepened his craft without exactly broadening it, which makes ‘The Thrill of It All’ feel more like a fine-tuning than a bold new adventure.”

“Smith’s voice remains a thing of wonder throughout. On the old soul-styled ‘One Last Song’, he sweeps smoothly into a clear high tenor without slipping into falsetto escape, thereby evoking more genuine emotional connection; and his vibrato touches in ‘Burning’ are subtly controlled, against the rich choral backing vocals that give the album a powerful gospel flavour.”

“Even to the untutored ear, it’s obvious the 25-year-old is a fearsome ninja of vocal technique. Which makes the ‘thrill’ in that title doubly baffling, because it doesn’t relate to anything in this mannered and self-consciously ‘moving’ soul-blues set...

“Emotions are notoriously messy, but Smith’s controlled material reflects none of that. If The Thrill Of It All were any more constipated, it would come with laxative coupons.”

″‘The Thrill of It All’ shakes some of the stuffiness off Smith’s sound by livening up arrangements. Songs that would’ve been hammered out as droll piano ballads get fleshed out with strings, horns, and sweeping backing vocals.

“But writing off the album’s embrace of soul and gospel as a deliberate signifier of groundedness… ignores how genuinely engaged Smith sounds when singing this music.”

“Even at a compact 10 songs, ’The Thrill of It All’ has a dull spot or two... but these are small quibbles, and at a brisk 35 minutes, the album is so aerodynamically constructed that it quickly flies past any rough patches.

“Much of it feels comfortable; at 25, Smith can still sing the hell out of the kind of love songs he could sing the hell out of when he was 20. But he’s grown, too, and ’The Thrill of It All’ is best when he stretches out of his comfort zone.”

“For “The Thrill of It All,” the musical backdrop is far lusher than it was on his debut, though Smith’s voice is still distinctive enough and powerful enough to command the spotlight in every song.

“Sometimes, Smith’s sadness becomes a bit overwhelming, but his voice remains a marvel, making ‘The Thrill of It All’ an even more potent statement than his thrilling debut.”

“Of course, Sam Smith’s voice is just as powerful as ever - though his range is occasionally tested, his falsetto, control, and technical skill are all impressively on point.

“Again; nothing on ‘The Thrill of It All’ will surprise anyone, it’s very much peak Sam Smith. But it’s romantic, painfully honest, bleak as hell, and just as impressive.”",Sam Smith's 'The Thrill Of It All' Reviews: What Did The Critics Say About His Latest Release?,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sam-smith-album-reviews-thrill-of-it-all_uk_59fb0832e4b0b0c7fa384333?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

”Willkommen in Kenia”: Was steckt dahinter?

Der Bundesstaat Hawaii gilt seit Jahren als Hochburg der Demokraten. 62 Prozent der Einwohner stimmten bei der letzten US-Wahl für Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama konnte bei den vorangegangenen Wahlen sogar ein überwältigendes Ergebnis von jeweils 71 Prozent einfahren, nicht zuletzt, weil Obama auf Hawaii geboren wurde.

Es gibt allerdings einige Amerikaner, die das nie glauben wollten – allen voran Donald Trump.

Eine “extrem glaubwürdige Quelle” habe in seinem Büro angerufen und ihm erzählt, dass Barack Obamas Geburtsurkunde gefälscht sei, schrieb Trump 2012 auf Twitter und wurde damit zum Redeführer eine Gruppe von Verschwörungstheoretikern, die glauben, Obama sei in Wirklichkeit in Kenia geboren.

Dann hätte Obama keine Berechtigung gehabt, sich um das Amt des US-Präsidenten zu bewerben, denn die Verfassung sieht vor, dass nur Personen, die in den Vereinigten Staaten geboren wurden, Präsident werden können.

Auf dem Marinestützpunkt angekommen, besuchte der US-Präsident das Wrack der USS Arizona. Das Kriegsschiff kenterte beim Angriff der Japaner auf Pearl Harbour am 7. Dezember 1941. Die Leichen der sich darin befindenden Soldaten sind noch immer im Bug des Schiffes eingeschlossen. Trump ehrte die Gefallenen, indem er weiße Blütenblätter ins Wasser streute.

Anschließend reisten er und seine Frau Melania weiter nach Japan.

La legge elettorale voluta dal Pd e da pochi giorni promulgata dal Presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella penalizzerebbe, e di molto, i democratici. Lo dice una proiezione fatta da Youtrend che, naturalmente, ha utilizzato come base di partenza il voto più recente, quello delle elezioni regionali appena concluse. E il responso è senza appello per il Pd: zero collegi uninominali.

Il Rosatellum è un sistema elettorale misto: proporzionale per il 64%, maggioritario per il 36%. Secondo i dati in via di consolidamento di questa tornata regionale, nei collegi del maggioritario il Pd sarebbe tagliato fuori nell'isola fino ad oggi guidata da Rosario Crocetta. Sembra quindi materializzarsi quel sospetto iniziato a circolare negli ambienti parlamentari dem qualche giorno prima dell'approvazione definitiva della legge elettorale al Senato. Uno studio commissionato dal Pd aveva già messo in guardia i democratici sul rischio di perdere pesantemente nei collegi di alcune regioni. Al Nord, per esempio, come in Veneto e Lombardia, tra le Regioni più pesanti in termini di seggi. Ma anche nel profondo Sud, come in Calabria e in Sicilia.

Nei collegi uninominali la sfida è tra i singoli candidati e ad aggiudicarsi il seggio è colui che prende un voto in più del suo avversario. La Sicilia, peraltro, è terra ostica per la sinistra da vent'anni a questa parte (il Pd è il partito uscente di governo ma la sua vittoria alle elezioni del 2012 fu certamente favorita dalle divisioni del centrodestra - con Musumeci e Micciché avversari e oggi alleati - e da un M5S più debole di oggi). Basti ricordare che in Sicilia si registrò il famoso 61 a 0 del centrodestra nei collegi uninominali alle elezioni politiche del 2001: allora si votò con il Mattarellum che si basava su dei collegi più piccoli rispetto a quelli che dovranno essere ridefiniti dal Governo per l'applicazione del Rosatellum. Saranno tra i 20 e i 22 e in nessuno di questi il centrosinistra riuscirebbe a vincere il seggio. Mentre punta all'en plein il centrodestra, come ha fatto intendere lo stesso Micciché ospite al Tg La7: ""Credo che qui in Sicilia se riusciamo ad arrivare al 40% noi vinciamo tutti e ventidue i collegi delle prossime elezioni nazionali, se il centrodestra è unito in questa Regione non ce n'è per nessuno"".

Secondo Youtrend, se i dati che arrivano dal voto regionale saranno confermati dal voto nazionale di marzo prossimo, alla coalizione di centrodestra andrebbero tra i 12 e i 14 collegi, e tra i 6 gli 8 al Movimento 5 Stelle.

THE EDITED GUEST LIST

No more agonizing or arguing over whether to invite every single cousin or the fallback of implementing a no-kids policy. Simply invite your parents (or not!) and besties, and be done with it. When the guest list is cut by 90 percent, most people understand if they didn’t make the cut. Will Great Aunt Gloria lose it over being left out? Weigh that against being able to recognize — and be truly happy to see — every face in your crowd.

THE DOABLE DECOR

Lusting after that limited edition French china on Etsy? Go ahead. Buy a set or three. Dreaming of that florist you found on Instagram to make a table arrangement? Go ahead. DM her. When you’re just decorating one table (think: a super-chic dinner party) or one small room (hey, dancing is mandatory for you), the pressure’s off — especially when it comes to your wallet.

THE ANYTHING-GOES ATTIRE

Walking down the “aisle” of a courthouse, a garden, a restaurant or your own backyard doesn’t call for a 25-foot couture train — or the months of fittings that go with it. Want to wear a badass jumpsuit à la Solange? Do your thing. And if you do want the big gown, that’s your decision to make as well. The point is, you’re controlling things, not the dress code or other people’s expectations. (P.S. That also means no need to force your BFFS into matching bridesmaids dresses either. Just sayin’.)

This one is different. This tells you everything you need to know if you're a once-a-year punter. Well, sort of.

And by the way, if you're wondering why Australia's best racehorse Winx isn't running, that's because she doesn't run over marathon distances. The Melbourne Cup is 3200m. Winx has won between 1100m and 2200m. She'll put her hooves up and leave this one to the stayers.

1. HARTNELL

Jockey: Damian Lane. Trainer: James Cummings. Odds: $26

Hartnell ran third in the 2016 Melbourne Cup after starting favourite, then promptly retired. Problem is, his trainer James Cummings (grandson of the late Cup legend Bart) is stubbornly ignoring this fact. Hartnell has spent the entire year locked in a room watching reruns of old Bachelor series, yet Cummings is still running him in the Cup. Someone, please, set poor old Hartnell free in a paddock.

2. ALMANDIN

Jockey: Frankie Dettori. Trainer: Robert Hickmott. Odds: $7.50

You know who the last horse to win back-to-back Cups was? It was Makybe Diva, who won three Cups from 2003-05 and was a legend. Almandin is not that. This deluded quadruped thought he was a big celebrity after last year's win, then blew all his prizemoney playing poker at Warney's house. He also took up smoking ""Whinny"" Reds. Has as much chance of a repeat win as the Richmond Tigers.

3. HUMIDOR

Jockey: Blake Shinn. Trainer: Darren Weir. Odds: $8.50

Potentially the best horse in the race, but here's the problem. There is good Humidor and bad Humidor. Good Humidor is the horse who nearly beat Australia's greatest racehorse Winx last week. Bad Humidor is the one who whines like a lonely puppy when things don't go his way. Humidor is reportedly so upset after losing to Winx, he'll stay in the Melbourne Cup starting gates and sulk until December.

4. TIBERIAN

Jockey: Olivier Peslier. Trainer: Alain Couetil. Odds: $31

Never in the rich history of the Melbourne Cup has there been a story like this. Tiberian's dad was a ""teaser pony"". His job was to stimulate mares so that they are ready to mate with expensive stallions. But one day, the owner of Tiberian's dad took pity and said hey, have a mare. The result is Tiberian. And to everyone's shock, he's fast! Read the full story here.

5. MARMELO.

Jockey: Hugh Bowman. Trainer: Hughie Morrison. Odds: $8.50

""A beautiful Melbourne Cup trial,"" the racecaller said as Marmelo crossed the line in 6th place in the Caulfield Cup. ""Excellent performance, he's right on track for the Melbourne Cup,"" his jockey (and Winx's regular rider) Hugh Bowman said after same. This European visitor is indeed on track. And will probably win. And when jockey Hugh and trainer Hughie combine, expect HUGE headlines.

6. RED CARDINAL

Jockey: Kerrin McEvoy. Trainer: Andreas Wohler. Odds: $16

The jockey has won two Melbourne Cups, including last year's. The trainer won the 2014 Melbourne Cup with Protectionist. The horse? Ah, well there's the problem. He's raced in both the U.S. and Europe, but has not had a start in Australia. He's such an unknown quantity here that he doesn't even know where the track is, and will bypass the race trying to hit on to Sophie Monk in the Flemington Birdcage .

In truth, we don't even know if Sophie Monk will be at Flemington, but whatever.

7. JOHANNES VERMEER

Jockey: Ben Melham. Trainer: Aidan O'Brien. Odds: $10

This horse is named after a 17th century Dutchman who painted interior scenes like the one above. Why does the milk need to be transferred from the jug to the bowl? What purpose does this serve? And why name a horse after man who painted such dreariness? What we do know is that this European Raider has been super impressive in his two Aussie runs (including 3rd in the Caulfield Cup), and could easily win.

Yawn.

8. BONDI BEACH

Jockey: Michael Walker. Trainer: Robert Hickmott. Odds: $67

Stupid, ugly strip of Sydney sand full of hipsters and fashionistas and tattooed thugs and inferior coffee which has assumed equine form to tackle this race for the third straight year. Ran 16th and 13th in the past two Melbourne Cups years and has about as much chance of improving this year as Sydney does of beating Melbourne in a culture battle.

9. MAX DYNAMITE

Jockey: Zac Purton. Trainer: William Mullins. Odds: $17

This horse ran second to Michelle Payne's mount Prince of Penzance two years ago. He has been sulking so much ever since that he's only had four races and pretty much gone in reverse on each occasion. Trackwork watchers say he's been running brilliant times on the training track all week in Melbourne, but he's now nine years old, which is ancient in horsey terms, and he'll likely need a mid race grandpa nap.

10. VENTURA STORM

Jockey: Glen Boss. Trainers: David & B Hayes & T Dabernig. Odds: $34

Jockey Glen Boss is the man who won three straight Melbourne Cups aboard Makybe Diva. This horse won't make it four. Ventura Storm's last win was a year ago in Milan, Italy, and ever since then he's switched his diet from oats to risotto and slowed down accordingly. If you like turning twenty dollar bills into confetti, then this is the horse for you.

11. WHO SHOT THEBARMAN

Jockey: Tommy Berry. Trainer: Chris Waller. Odds: $41

This horse has performed well in the last three Cups, running 3rd in 2014, 11th in 2015 and 5th last year. Unfortunately, he is now dead. Who Shot Thebarman won the Moonee Valley Cup last week but don't be fooled. Some kind of Weekend at Bernie's thing is going on, and we promise you, his soul is in horsey heaven, and the only reason his body is here is because his owners love the prestige.

BREAKING NEWS: WHO SHOT THEBARMAN WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE MELBOURNE CUP ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON DUE TO AN ""ELEVATED FEVER"". IF THEY SAY SO.

12. WICKLOW BRAVE

Jockey: Stephen Baster. Trainer: William Mullins. Odds: $61

Wicklow Brave ran 3rd last in the 2016 Melbourne Cup, and wouldn't win the 2017 version if he started on Monday morning and was carried around the track by an enormous flock of seagulls (which as far as we know is not against the rules). His last race was over the jumps in Ireland and everyone in racing knows that you put slow horses that can't win regular races in jumps races.

13. BIG DUKE

J​​​ockey: Brenton Avdulla. Trainer: Darren Weir. Odds: $20

They say in racing you've always got to forgive a horse one bad run. Big Duke had his bad run in the recent Moonee Valley Cup where he basically forgot he was a racehorse halfway through the race. If he remembers he's a racehorse on Tuesday at 3pm, he could easily give trainer Darren Weir (of Prince of Penzance/Michelle Payne fame) a second Cup because his form this spring in longer races is terrific.

Big Duke's rider Brenton Avdulla is one of the in-form jockeys in the country, and couldn't resist a big cheesy grin when winning on Big Duke in Sydney recently.

14. US ARMY RANGER

Jockey: Jamie Spencer. Trainer: Joseph O'Brien. Odds: $61

In a joint exercise between the Trump and Turnbull governments, this horse has been sent to the southern hemisphere to Make The Melbourne Cup Great Again. He will of course fail miserably. At his most recent start, this four-legged catastrophe ran last in a race in Ireland. It's not mathematically possibly to run worse than last, but we're confident he'll find a way in the Melbourne Cup.

15. BOOM TIME

Jockey: Cory Parish. Trainers: D & B Hayes & T Dabernig. Odds: $31

This clumsy, lumbering waste of hay started his racing career in WA and should have stayed there. After finally winning a race at its 10th start, he did what most West Australians do and became a FIFO worker. It now lives in the east and somehow won the Caulfield Cup recently, but only because every other horse got lost. The mining boom is over and so is this horse.

16. GALLANTE

Jockey: Michael Dee. Trainer: Robert Hickmott. Odds: $151

He ran 20th in last year's Melbourne Cup and has had just two runs since. In one race it ran 15th of 15. In the next it ran 7th of 12. Gallante is so slow, a Melbourne tram beat it to the track in heavy traffic when it was running at top speed. The one piece of good news is that if you draw this four-legged dawdler in the office sweep, you'll almost certainly get your money back when he runs last.

17. LIBRAN

Jockey: Dwayne Dunn. Trainer: Chris Waller. Odds: $51

If your astrological birth sign is Libra, then for obvious reasons this is the horse for you -- especially since we are currently in that time of the calendar. There's just one thing you should know. This horse, from the same stable as champion Winx, has ignored everything that Winx has tried to tell it about going fast, and pretty much followed the opposite path in life.

18. NAKEETA

Jockey: 53 Glyn Schofield. Trainer: Iain Jardine. Odds: $31

He's Scotland's first Melbourne Cup runner but beware! This ""seven-year-old gelding"" is not actually a horse, but is in fact four stablehands in a horse suit. Scariest of all, they are wearing kilts with you-know-what underneath.​​

19. SINGLE GAZE

Jockey: Kathy O'Hara. Trainer: Nick Olive. Odds: $34

There's a fantastic story here. Single Gaze and rider Kathy O'Hara had an awful fall at Randwick in April 2016. O'Hara suffered a punctured lung, broken collarbone and ribs. The duo have since bounced back. O'hara has ridden this lovely chestnut mare at each of her last 22 starts, including their fantastic second in the 2017 Caulfield Cup. Can they go one better here? Probably not, but hey, ya gotta dream.

20. WALL OF FIRE

Jockey: Craig Williams. Trainer: Hugo Palmer. Odds: $13

A lot of professional racing tipsters are tipping this British stayer to win, but it's a little known fact that most tipsters in fact spend the majority their lives begging for coins outside railway stations because they're so appallingly bad at their jobs. Expect them to be even broker than usual on Wednesday morning after this appallingly slovenly creature does what it does best -- fails.

21. THOMAS HOBSON

Jockey: TBA. Trainer: Charlie Appleby. Odds: $15

In history, Thomas Hobson was a stable owner in Cambridge, England, born in the 1500s, who was famous for making clients rent the slowest of his horses. It is from him that the phrase ""Hobson's Choice"" originates, which essentially means ""take it or leave it"". So should you take or leave this washed-up old Irish stayer? You already know the answer.

22. REKINDLING

Jockey: Corey Brown Joseph O'Brien. Odds: $15

They're not saying much about this U.K. import who has raced just nine times, but is rated extremely highly by owner Lloyd Williams, who has won five Melbourne Cups (including last year's). In truth, this colt is hopeless. His jockey won the 2009 Melbourne Cup on a horse called ""Shocking"", and that's kind of apt, because Rekindling is exactly that. On the plus side, it does have four legs. For now.

23. AMELIE'S STAR

Jockey: Dean Yendall. Trainer: Darren Weir. Odds: $17

Every Australian should hope Amelie's Star wins the Melbourne Cup, if only for the guaranteed entertainment value. After winning a major race in the spring carnival last year, jockey Dean Yendall -- a champion bush rider who only rides occasionally in the city -- said ""I've got a raging horn"". The bloke is so deliciously non-PC, he deserves to win this race. Alas, Amelie's Star's fastest speed is ""backwards"".

24. CISMONTANE

Jockey: Beau Mertens. Trainer: Gai Waterhouse. Odds: $41

Gai Waterhouse -- the trainer of 2013 Cup winner Fiorente and mum of annoying former TV bookie Tom -- qualified this horse at the 11th hour, after winning the Lexus Stakes at Flemington on Saturday. Cismontane is a front-runner so will likely lead the field into the straight, before it is swallowed up by a sinkhole the size of one of Gai's elaborate pieces of millinery that spontaneously opens up on the Flemington turf.

Son premier ministre Edouard Philippe avait alors promis de venir se rendre compte sur place du respect de cette promesse.

Deux mois plus tard, le chef du gouvernement et son ministre de l'Education Jean-Michel Blanquer sont attendus ce dimanche 5 novembre à Saint-Martin où la totalité des élèves de la partie française de l'île devraient retourner à l'école à partir de lundi. ""100% des élèves inscrits et présents dans l'île pourront être scolarisés"", assure Michel Sanz, inspecteur d'académie et directeur académique adjoint de Saint-Barthélemy et Saint-Martin.

Sur le papier, la promesse gouvernementale est donc tenue même s'il est difficile de parler de ""retour à la normale"". Au total, 18 établissements scolaires sur 21 (16 écoles et 5 lycées-collèges) ont été touchés par l'ouragan et ses vents à plus de 350 km/h, qui ont dévasté l'île le jour de la rentrée de septembre. Depuis, le retour à l'école s'est fait de manière progressive. Un quart des élèves a pu reprendre le chemin des classes trois semaines après Irma, et d'autres écoles ont rouvert peu à peu. Officiellement, depuis le 16 octobre, tous les élèves peuvent retourner dans leur école, collège ou lycée d'origine, sauf dans six établissements: trois écoles maternelles, deux élémentaires et un collège.

Rotation et partage des locaux

Pour les élèves de ces établissements, un ""plan d'action"" a été imaginé avec un système de rotation et un partage inédit des locaux encore sur pied. A titre d'exemple, les élèves de l'école maternelle Simeonne Trott seront ainsi accueillis à l'école maternelle Evelina Halley tandis que ceux du collège Soualiga étudieront à la cité scolaire Robert Weinum.

""C'est le principe de deux écoles en une. De 7h à midi, l'établissement recevra ses élèves et ses professeurs. Et de 12h30 à 17h30, ce sont les enfants et les enseignants d'un établissement voisin sinistré qui seront sur les lieux. Et ce, cinq jours par semaine"", explique Michel Sanz. Selon l'inspecteur d'académie, un enseignement ""normal"", toutes matières confondues, sera dispensé. La volonté est de rattraper peu à peu le retard. ""Il faudra vraisemblablement (...) modifier le calendrier des prochaines vacances scolaires afin de les raccourcir, notamment pour les élèves de Terminale"", indique-t-il.

Objectif: faire en sorte que les examens de fin d'année scolaire se déroulent dans des conditions normales et aux dates prévues.

Des enseignants toujours absents?

Une partie des quelques 6089 élèves inscrits avant le passage d'Irma devrait toutefois poursuivre leur scolarité en dehors de Saint-Martin. Selon Michel Sanz, 10 à 15% des élèves sont partis du territoire ""notamment en Guadeloupe et en (métropole). Pour ceux qui sont en Guadeloupe, nous avons une vision assez claire de leur situation et de leur lieu d'affectation"". Dans l'hexagone, plusieurs familles réfugiées se sont plaintes d'avoir été abandonnées dans des hôtels. Elles ont finalement été relogées ""dans un centre d'hébergement unique"" où les enfants devaient être scolarisés.

Reste la question des enseignants, dont certains ont quitté le territoire après le passage de l'ouragan sans indiquer s'ils seraient présents ce lundi. Aucun chiffre n'a filtré sur le nombre de professeurs ayant repris du service. Sauf situations particulières, tous les enseignants que comptait l'île sont attendus lundi.

Mais ce vendredi, la ministre des Outre-mer, Annick Girardin, s'est dite ""choquée"" par les départs de certains professeurs et a évoqué de possibles sanctions. ""J'estimais qu'à partir du moment où on avait protégé sa famille (...) les enseignants après quelques jours ou quelques semaines de sas, devaient être présents, puisqu'ils sont payés, sur Saint-Martin (...) faire autre chose!"", a-t-elle dénoncé sur RTL. ""Je suis une fonctionnaire, j'estime qu'il y avait un devoir d'être présent. Pour moi, c'est de l'abandon de poste pour ceux qui ne sont pas revenus"", a-t-elle ajouté.

""Beaucoup d'enseignants sont partis après l'ouragan, mais beaucoup sont rentrés"", dédramatise le délégué interministériel chargé de la reconstruction de Saint-Barth et Saint-Martin Philippe Gustin.

Verdict ce lundi.

De tous les articles sur cette affaire, une chronique du producteur David Poirot-Gozlan pour le HuffPost m'a particulièrement interpellée. Dans sa tribune, il écrit que le scandale ""mérite d'élargir la réflexion sur cette violence sournoise qui s'insinue partout, de la signalétique dans les trains (oui Eurostar, papa aussi change bébé) à l'institutionnalisation des inégalités aux dépens des femmes...""

Tara Mulholland

Sa référence à la signalétique Eurostar m'a frappée. Non seulement parce que je me suis plainte également de cette signalétique (un lien dans son article renvoie vers une image que j'avais postée sur Twitter). Mais parce que, comme le souligne Poirot-Gozlan, ce type de sexisme, moins accrocheur qu'un scandale, en a les mêmes fondements.

Dans son livre ""Moranifesto"", la journaliste britannique Caitlin Moran écrit que notre culture est tissée des histoires que nous nous racontons. Ce ne sont pas nos politiques qui forment nos représentations, mais les histoires racontées dans les films, les livres, la mode, les pubs... Nous avons beau dire à nos enfants que les hommes et les femmes sont nés égaux, si la réalité qu'ils voient ne correspond pas à cela, ils ne vont jamais vraiment nous croire.

Pour rappel: dans les anciens trains Eurostar, la signalétique des espaces de change montrait un simple logo d'un bébé. En 2016, le logo a changé: maintenant il dépeint une figure en jupe qui change le bébé.

Tara Mulholland

Qui, je me demande, à chaque fois que je prends le train depuis ce changement, qui, au 21ème siècle, a pu juger que ce logo devait dépeindre une femme?

J'ai contacté Eurostar pour leur faire part de ma stupéfaction: ""Merci pour vos retours précieux"" me répondent-ils. ""Nous enverrons vos remarques au bon département.""

Tara Mulholland

Quelques mois plus tard, je trouve d'autres plaintes sur Twitter. Je me décide à enquêter et je contacte SomeOne, la compagnie britannique qui a produit le nouveau design pour les trains. ""Cette jupe ne fait pas partie de notre design"", m'écrivent- ils. Ils m'envoient une photo du logo qu'ils avaient proposé, une figure neutre qui change le bébé, sans jupe: ""Nous préférons largement notre design original"".

Tara Mulholland

Je recontacte Eurostar. Pourquoi ont-t-ils décidé de rajouter une jupe? ""Nous vous remercions pour vos retours précieux"" me répondent-ils à nouveau. ""Nous réfléchirons à un éventuel changement."" En insistant, j'apprends que le nouveau design a été validé depuis longtemps et que plus personne ne peut me renseigner. Fin de l'échange.

Ce qui est symptomatique dans cet exemple c'est la supposition que s'occuper d'un enfant est seulement un travail de femme.

De nombreuses études montrent qu'aujourd'hui les inégalités entre les sexes augmentent à la naissance d'un enfant. Et que, dans le monde du travail, les femmes ""sont pénalisées parce qu'elles sont ou pourraient devenir mères"". Comment peut-on espérer dépasser l'ère machiste de ""Mad Men"" si nous restons entourés des images qui perpétuent un modèle sociétal où l'homme travaille et la femme s'occupe des enfants et de la maison?

Dans son livre ""How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids"", l'écrivaine Jancee Dunn remarque que dans les couples hétérosexuels où les partenaires travaillent à plein temps, l'arrivée d'un enfant augmente les inégalités d'une manière disproportionnée: à l'âge de 9 mois, elle note, en citant une étude d'Ohio State University, que le temps imparti aux taches ménagères et à la garde des enfants est presque le double pour les femmes.

Les hommes doivent faire mieux, certes. Mais, comme le souligne Dunn, une grande partie du problème vient justement des femmes, qui subissent ce rôle, même si cela finit par un burn-out; qui, faute d'un sens de légitimité, apprennent à se taire.

Ce manque de légitimité se retrouve d'une manière plus terrifiante dans les mots de plusieurs femmes qui ont témoigné contre Weinstein. Elles ne fuyaient pas ses avances d'emblée car elles doutaient­. Elles se demandaient si elles n'étaient pas en train de sur-réagir à une réalité globalement acceptée. ""Oh mon Dieu, c'est donc ceci une promotion canapé"" a été la pensée fataliste de l'actrice Romola Garai, qui était ""interviewée"" par Weinstein pour son rôle dans ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights."" Laura Madden, une ancienne employée de la compagnie Weinstein, expose les faits encore plus clairement: ""Tu te poses constamment la question: est-ce que c'est moi qui aie un problème?""

Ce manque de légitimité est un sentiment qui vient, en grande partie, de la sémiologie qui nous entoure. De nos signalétiques sexistes aux films hollywoodiens qui nous livrent si peu de vraies héroïnes. On nous inonde de pubs sexistes et de dessins animés archi-rétros (Oui, je vous parle de Petit Ours Brun et Peppa Pig). Et maintenant on nous dévoile ces sex robots qui peuvent être ""réparés"" si les hommes en abusent trop...

Eurostar est loin d'être la seule compagnie à utiliser une signalétique sexiste: ces pratiques perdurent. En Angleterre, on appelle ça ""everyday sexism"" (le sexisme au quotidien) terme popularisé par Laura Bates, la fondatrice du Everyday Sexism Project, une initiative pour lutter contre le sexisme ordinaire.

Nous devons, évidemment, essayer d'élever nos enfants avec des modèles féminins et masculins. Mais nous devons aussi nous insurger à chaque fois que nous sommes confrontés à ce que Caitlin Moran appelle ""Les Conneries Patriarcales"". En pratiquant une politique de zéro tolérance, comme le propose Moran, les choses doivent changer.

Il existe des signes prometteurs.

L'année dernière, Ikea a promis de changer la signalétique de ses espaces de change en Espagne suite aux tweets de parents outrés. En mai, la blogueuse Emma a publié sa BD sur la charge mentale qui devint rapidement un phénomène viral. En août, les supermarchés Marks & Spencer ont promis de changer la signalétique dans les toilettes suite à un post sur Facebook, et, quelques semaines plus tard, la grande chaîne de supermarchés Canadien Sobeys a répondu en direct au Tweet d'un père critiquant leurs places de parking ""Maman et Bébé"" –pour promettre un changement. Le même mois, la marque de chaussures Clarks a retiré son nouveau modèle de chaussure pour filles –""Dolly Babe"", synonyme du mot ""bimbo"", (le nouveau modèle pour garçons s'appelait ""Leader Play"") après une explosion de plaintes sur Twitter.

Si nous voulons une vraie égalité entre hommes et femmes, commençons dès à présent à afficher partout la certitude que les hommes et les femmes sont parents et que ni l'un ni l'autre n'est plus adapté à s'occuper des enfants.

""Le langage n'est jamais innocent"" écrivait Roland Barthes. Et la sémiologie ne l'est pas non plus. Mais si nous pouvons, pierre par pierre, nous débarrasser de tous ces stéréotypes sexistes, nous finirons peut-être par déplacer une montagne.

'Why are you still single?'

We've either been asked the question or posed it ourselves, but what's the real answer?

People will respond to this in a variety of ways, most commonly placing the blame on surface pressures, but it's actually the way we speak to ourselves about dating that could be the real answer to this query.

""Most people play a significant role in keeping themselves single,"" relationship expert Melanie Schilling told HuffPost Australia. ""It's common to blame external factors -- for example, 'it's too cold, I'll start dating after winter' or 'there's a man drought' -- and at the core of most self-sabotage is fear.""

Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship.

Self-sabotaging behaviours are usually based on fear and while people adapt these as a means of self-protection, often they can actually prevent dating success rather than guaranteeing it. These can arise from fear of rejection, vulnerability or being hurt again and giving up independence or happiness.

""Often when people have been emotionally scarred in the past -- and let's face it, who hasn't -- it's common to be self-protective. But there is a difference between being healthily skeptical and undermining your own happiness,"" Schilling said.

""At the core of dating resistance is usually a set of beliefs -- about oneself, about partners or about relationships.""

Three Types of Negative Dating Beliefs Schilling says that negative dating beliefs fall into three key categories and they can impact on how we approach dating situations. 1. Beliefs about yourself -- 'I don't deserve happiness, I'm useless at relationships, I'll only mess it up, I'm better off single.' 2. Beliefs about men and women -- 'All men/women cheat, they will break my heart, they always leave eventually.' 3. Beliefs about relationships -- 'What if something better comes along?, a relationship will stunt my independence, I don't have time for a relationship.'

Holding some or all of these core beliefs can impact on your level of 'date readiness' and can result in self-sabotaging your own dating success.

Schilling has devised the 'Date Ready Ladder' that can help assess where you might sit in the realm of dating and therefore, what you can do to improve your dating success.

The first three rungs on the ladder illustrate behaviours that can lead to a 'dating fail', while the top three are approaches that could lead to a 'dating win'.

The 'Date Ready Ladder'

'Self-sabotage' is ""actively undermining and blocking opportunities for social interaction or dating potential,"" Schilling said. ""Essentially telling the world you are not interested in a relationship -- either consciously or unconsciously.""

The next step up the ladder is the 'resistant' category, where ""despite feeling open to a relationship, [you avoid] opportunities or make oneself unavailable for dating options"".

The final step towards a 'dating win' is the 'ambivalent' approach -- ""one foot in and one foot out of the dating pool,"" Schilling explained. ""Sending mixed messages to potential dates.""

Sending mixed messages is characteristic of being in an 'ambivalent' dating mindset.

So, how do we recognise that we could be self-sabotaging our own dating lives and move out of our own way?

Schilling suggests starting by dating yourself can lead to positive relationships in the future.

In einem Interview hat der erfahrene Politiker nun Einblicke in die Vorgänge hinter verschlossenen Türen gegeben

Was Trittin beschreibt, mutet bisweilen bizarr an

Die große Zeit von Jürgen Trittin bei den Grünen schien eigentlich längst vorbei. Nach den Bundestagswahlen 2013 schob sich die Partei immer mehr in die bürgerlich-gemächliche Mitte, Jürgen Trittin blieb eher allein am linken Rand zurück. Einen großen Posten hat der ehemalige Bundesminister nicht mehr inne.

Doch jetzt verhandelt Trittin für seine Partei mit über die mögliche Jamaika-Koalition. Plötzlich ist er wieder wichtig - und laut. Die ""taz"" schrieb unlängst in einem Portrait über Trittin, er sei für Union und FDP - aber auch für manche Parteikollegen, ein U-Boot: ""Sie fragen sich, ob er für Jamaika Geleitschutz gibt oder ob er irgendwann den Torpedo auf den eigenen Tanker feuert.""

Trittins Rolle bei den Grünen, so die Zeitung, sei während der Sondierungsgespräche die des ""diabolisch angehauchten Kotzbrockens, den die Gegenseite fürchtet"". In dieser Weise lässt sich auch ein Interview Trittins mit dem ""Spiegel"" lesen, in dem der Grünen-Politiker Union und FDP attackiert - und einen Einblick in bizarre Vorgänge bei den Jamaika-Verhandlungen gibt.

Trittin: ""Das gleitet schon ins Satirische ab""

Gegenüber dem Magazin betont Trittin die Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen während der Verhandlungen - es seien vielmehr die FDP und besonders die Union, die blockieren würden. Im Fall der CDU spricht der Grüne gar von einer ""Totalblockade"" und ""absurden Streitigkeiten über Begriffe"".

So seien die Gespräche beim Thema Zukunft des Verbrennungsmotors an zwei Wörtern gescheitert: ""Entdatum"" und ""Elektromobilität"". Beide Begriffe habe die CDU nicht in den Papieren haben wollen. Lieber wolle man dort über ""alternative Antriebe"" schreiben.

""Das gleitet schon ins Satirische ab"", echauffiert sich Trittin über solche Wortklaubereien. Nach zwei, drei Stunden Streit hätten die Grünen sich dann einen Spaß erlaubt, und den Koalitionsvertrag von CDU und FDP in Nordrhein-Westfalen herausgeholt. ""Da steht, dass NRW zum Vorreiter bei Elektromobilität werden soll. Plötzlich hat die CDU ihren Widerstand aufgegeben.""

Auch die FDP wird von Trittin deutlich kritisiert

Glaubt man Trittin, sei das größere Hindernis für eine Jamaika-Koalition jedoch vor allem die FDP.

Die habe lieber vier Jahre von rechts Opposition gegen eine Große Koalition machen wollen und käme nun aber nicht aus der Verantwortung. ""Also provozieren sie uns, in der Hoffnung, dass wir Grüne die Reißleine ziehen"", sagt Trittin dem ""Spiegel"", ""dabei unterschätzt die FDP unsere Intelligenz.""

Am Ende läuft es nach Trittins Darstellung bei den Sondierungsgesprächen auf folgende Konstellation hinaus: Schwarz-Gelb blockiert, die Grünen seien bereit für Kompromisse, doch Union und FDP ""sind sich offenbar einig, dass die Grünen möglichst wenig, am besten gar nichts durchsetzen sollen"".

➨ Mehr zum Thema: CSU-Politiker Dobrindt wütet: ""Die Grünen provozieren das Scheitern von Jamaika""

Diese Anspannung führe dann dazu, dass man zwei Stunden über das Wort ""Elektromobilität"" streite. ""Das verschwendet unnütze Lebenszeit und trägt nicht zur Verbesserung der Laune bei"", findet Trittin. ""Aber wenn wir Grüne uns treffen, lachen wir ziemlich viel.""

Gerade Jürgen Trittin hat dafür allen Grund - er ist zurück im Rampenlicht.

Wenn man den Bewohnern Glauben schenken darf, soll das Dorf jedoch verflucht sein

Wie die Bewohner mit dem vermeintlichen Fluch umgehen, seht ihr oben im Video

Die kleine Ortschaft Colobraro in der süditalienischen Region Basilikata soll verflucht sein. Deshalb trauen sich die Einwohner der umliegenden Dörfer noch nicht einmal, den Namen des Ortes auszusprechen.

Das Wort Colobraro leitet sich von dem lateinischen Wort Coluber ab, was Schlange bedeutet. Für die abergläubischen Einheimischen ist die Schlange der Inbegriff des Bösen. Die Leute in der Region glauben, dass denjenigen, der den Namen laut ausspricht, Unheil verfolgen werde. Das geht auch aus einer Dokumentation des BBC hervor. Das Dorf wird deshalb nur “Quel pases“ genannt, was übersetzt nur “dieses Dorf“ heißt.

Der Fluch begann im Jahr 1940

Zudem soll ein alter Fluch über dem Dorf liegen, der im Jahr 1940 begann. Der damalige Bürgermeister prophezeite bei einer Versammlung, dass auf der Stelle ein Kronleuchter von der Decke stürzen werde - sollten die Zuhörern seinen Worten keinen Glauben schenken. Der Legende zufolge, die jeder Bewohner von Colobraro kennt, fiel der Leuchter darauf sofort herunter.

Darüber hinaus lebten bis in die 70er Jahre die damals berüchtigten “Masciare“ in dem Dorf. Dabei soll es sich um Zauberinnen gehandelt haben, die mit ihrer bösen Magie angeblich ganze Städte kontrollierten. Ein Anthropologe besuchte das Dorf im Jahr 1952, um die Geschichte der Masciare zu erforschen. Er wurde laut einer Legende selbst Opfer des Fluchs: Alle seine Kollegen wurden schlagartig krank.

Heute versuchen die Bewohner das Beste daraus zu machen

Seitdem sind die Bewohner der Region sicher, dass Colobraro verflucht ist. Der heutige Bürgermeister der Stadt versucht jedoch, das Beste aus der Lage zu machen. Er hat zum Beispiel ein Festival ins Leben gerufen, in dem die Bewohner Colobraros ihr verfluchtes Dorf feiern. Die Einwohner inszenieren darin jeden August ihre Unglückstraditionen. Frauen treten als Masciare auf, Wahrsagerinnen lesen Schicksale aus Händen der Besucher und die Bewohner verkaufen Schutzamulette. So kann die Gemeinde immerhin ihre klammen Kassen auffüllen.

Russell Crowe has voiced frustrations on Sunday over criticism he has received for his offer to take and find work for six men held by Australia on Manus Island, after labelling the escalating crisis as ""a nation's shame"".

On Thursday, Crowe tweeted his belief that he could accommodate some of the 600 asylum seekers who are currently stranded on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, abandoned by the Australian government, fearful local residents could attack them if they leave the soon-to-close detention centre and worried local authorities will attack them if they stay.

Since then, the 'Gladiator' star has faced a barrage of criticism from people angered by his focus on foreign asylum seekers over struggling Australians.

In multiple separate posts to Facebook, Crowe's critiques questioned everything from his place in discussing politics to his ability to house just six of the asylum seekers despite being a Hollywood actor.

""Russell Crowe is another joke. He has no business interfering with the government process. His ill informed opinion is just regurgetated [sic] fodder from those with a political agenda,"" one post said.

On Sunday Crowe hit back in another series of tweets, saying the negative feedback ""doesn't change that what Australia has done to these men on Manus is appalling"".

Crowe's offer came as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden said she would raise the issue with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, following the closure of the Manus Island detention centre, in their first meeting since she secured her country's leadership.

And while, during that meeting, Ardern offered on Sunday to take 150 asylum seekers currently in PNG and Nauru and accommodate them in New Zealand, Turnbull declined the offer -- instead prioritising Australia's existing refugee deal with the United States. Under that agreement, 1,250 refugees from the two Pacific nations will be resettled in the US.

Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.
Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.
Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.","Es gibt Momente im Leben, wo das eigene Selbstbild plötzlich völlig in Frage gestellt wird. Momente, wo fast alles, woran man geglaubt hat, sich als falsch erweist.

So einen Moment hatte ich vor Kurzem in der U-Bahn.

Ich dachte eigentlich immer von mir, dass ich ein offener Mensch sei. Liberal, aber gegen Rassismus, würde ich für meine Werte einstehen und diese - wenn nötig - auch verteidigen.

Jetzt weiß ich, dass ich falsch lag.

Ich war vor ein paar Tagen in der U-Bahn unterwegs. Autofahren war nie so mein Ding und die Dellen in meinem alten Wagen geben mir da recht. Daher habe ich schon seit Jahren eine Monatskarte.

Als ein gekünstelt freundliches ""Servus, die Fahrscheine bitte!"" durch den Wagon gerufen wurde, war ich daher auch wenig beunruhigt.

Routiniert zeigte ich mein Ticket, der Kontrolleur schaute ebenso routiniert drauf und wandte sich dem älteren Ehepaar mir gegenüber zu, die es mir gleich taten. So ging es dann immer weiter, ein Fahrgast nach dem anderen.

So weit, so unspektakulär.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst""

Plötzlich kam es zu einer Unterbrechung. Ein dunkelhäutiges Paar mit Kinderwagen hatte offensichtlich keine Fahrkarte dabei. Beide sprachen kein Deutsch, waren sich aber augenscheinlich bewusst, um was es ging.

Die Frau schien verunsichert, dem Mann war es wohl einfach nur sehr peinlich.

Die Bayern sind für ihre grantige Art bekannt und der Kontrolleur, der keine Anstalten machte, es auch auf Englisch zu versuchen, war hier keine Ausnahme. Er war nicht beleidigend, hatte aber diese typisch ruppige Art, die man entweder liebt oder eben nicht.

Der Kontrolleur wollte den Ausweis sehen, der Mann verstand nicht und hielt sein geöffnetes Portemonnaie hin. Vielleicht dachte er, man könne im Zug nachzahlen, oder er wollte direkt die Strafe zahlen, vielleicht auch etwas ganz Anderes - das kann ich nicht genau sagen, denn meine Aufmerksamkeit wurde unterbrochen.

""Das ist typisch bei denen. Die Schwarzen denken, hier ist alles umsonst - aber das stimmt nicht.""

Dieser Satz kam von dem älteren Mann, der gegenüber in meinem Vierersitz saß. Er sagte das zu niemandem im Besonderen, aber in diesem speziellen Ton, der zeigt, dass ihn alle in der Bahn hören sollten. Auch der Kontrolleur und der schwarze Mann.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die Neonazis neben mir in der U-Bahn

Ich weiß nicht, was es war. War es Peinlichkeit? Oder war es Angst? Schwer zu sagen. Auf jeden Fall war ich baff.

Der Mann ist in einem ganz gut besuchten U-Bahn-Abteil, umringt von Menschen, in einer der reichsten Städte Deutschlands, und hat keinerlei Vorbehalte, seine rassistischen Pauschalaussagen laut auszusprechen.

Er legte sogar noch nach.

""Natürlich mit Kind. Die vermehren sich rasant. Und das gibt auch mehr Mitleid.""

Die Bahn hielt, die Tür öffnete sich, der Kontrolleur und die Familie stieg aus, um die Sache weiter außerhalb des Zugs zu klären und wir fuhren wieder los.

Die Situation war vorbei, der Mann hatte seinen Teil gesagt und alle, inklusive mir, haben geschwiegen.

Ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete

Ich saß noch zwei weitere Stationen dem Mann gegenüber, habe starr aus dem Fenster in die Dunkelheit der U-Bahn-Schächte geschaut, bis ich ausgestiegen bin.

Mit schnellen Schritten ging ich nach Hause, klappte meinen Laptop auf und startete die erstbeste Serie auf Netflix. Schnell den Kopf mit irgendwelchen belanglosen Kram füllen, um nicht darüber nachzudenken, was eigentlich gerade passiert war.

Das hat für den ersten Moment auch funktioniert, aber nicht dauerhaft. Denn ich weiß genau, was mein Schweigen anrichtete.

Ein offensichtlicher Rassist hat in einer Gruppe von ca. 60 Mitfahrern seinen Hass verbreitet. Den Grund für seine Haltung kennen ich nicht. Vielleicht hat er schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht, vielleicht fällt er auf rechte Medien rein, vielleicht ist er so erzogen worden. Das weiß ich alles nicht, was ich aber sicher weiß, ist das mein Schweigen ihn in seiner Sicht bestätigt.

Niemand hat ihm widersprochen. Er hat laut seine Meinung gesagt und 60 Menschen haben kein Widerwort gegeben.

In seinem Kopf ist klar, was das bedeutet. Wenn er Unrecht gehabt hätte, hätte ihm doch wer widersprochen. Hat aber niemand, also müssen ja alle seiner Meinung sein.

Ich wollte mutig sein, aber habe versagt

Wenn ich auf Facebook Kommentare lese, wie ""die meisten Deutschen wachen ja jetzt auf"", ""die Mehrheit der Deutschen ist gegen die ausländischen Besatzer"" oder Klassiker wie ""wir sind das Volk"", ""wir sind Bürger, keine Nazis"", dann kommt das genau von solchen Situationen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich bin dunkelhäutig und Deutsche - trotzdem werde ich oft wie eine Fremde behandelt

Der Mann glaubt jetzt, dass die meisten Leute so denken wir er.

Auch wundert es nicht, wenn die Rechten in den Medien und sozialen Netzwerken so stark vertreten sind.

Natürlich schreiben die Nachrichtenseiten öfters über den neuen Hass-Tweet von irgendeinem AfD-Politiker als über die tolle Antwort der Nazi-Gegner. Denn viel zu selten kommt eine Antwort.

Ich mache mir keine Illusionen. Die politische Lage in Deutschland hätte sich nicht verändert, wenn ich etwas gesagt hätte. Wahrscheinlich hätte ich nicht mal den Mann in der U-Bahn umstimmen können.

Es hätte aber ein Zeichen sein können. An den Mann, dass nicht alle seiner Meinung sind und an alle in der Bahn, wie einfach es ist, ""Nein"" zu sagen.

Nein.

Früher habe ich laut Konstantin Weckers ""Sage Nein!"" gesungen.

""Ob du sechs bist oder hundert,

sei nicht nur erschreckt, verwundert,

tobe, zürne, misch dich ein

sage nein!""

Ich habe mir vor einiger Zeit vorgenommen, mutiger zu sein. Als die Chance sich bot, habe ich versagt. Das macht mich nicht zu einem schlechten Menschen, aber sicher auch nicht zu einem guten.

Bergdahl's case has sparked fierce emotions among politicians, the general public and the military alike.","Bergdahl, a U.S. Army soldier, left his post while on duty in Afghanistan's Paktika province on the night of June 30, 2009. He was captured by the Taliban shortly after, and was held captive by the militants of the Haqqani network for the next five years. Throughout his trial, Bergdahl recounted the extremely challenging conditions of his years in captivity and said he was tortured, beaten and humiliated by the militants.

Bergdahl was freed in May 2014 as part of a prisoner swap negotiated between the administration of former President Barack Obama and the Taliban. After returning to the United States, he pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Prosecutors sought 14 years of imprisonment.

Trump has been fiercely critical of the agreement that secured Bergdahl's release.

Trump also called the soldier a ""traitor"" at least 45 times while he was campaigning. ""We're tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who's a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,"" Trump said during an October 2015 campaign rally. During an Iowa campaign rally months later, Trump suggested Bergdahl should be ""thrown out of an airplane without a parachute.""

With his fierce rhetoric on Bergdahl, Trump once again dived into an issue that divides Americans. Bergdahl's case has sparked fierce emotions among politicians, the general public and the military alike. Bergdahl's defenders have argued he was young at the time and suffered from mental health conditions. They also pointed out the solder tried to escape several times while detained, and brought back important intelligence information on his captors.

Opponents have questioned Bergdahl's account of his years in captivity and blame him for needlessly risking the lives of the soldiers who were sent out to look for him.

Earlier this month, Bergdahl's defense team argued that Trump's comments in the case had harmed Bergdahl's chances of getting a fair trial. Nance dismissed the motion, but ruled he would consider the president's response a mitigating factor.

Eugene Fidell, an attorney for Berghdal, said on Friday that Trump's comments in the case should give Americans pause. ""President Trump's unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch-mob atmosphere while seeking our nation's highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case,"" Fidell said, according to Reuters.",Trump Calls Bergdahl Sentence A Disgrace To Country And Military,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/03/trump-calls-bergdahl-sentence-a-disgrace-to-country-and-military_a_23266269/

""If you like people watching there's probably nothing better than a royal wedding.
Elton John (C) and partner David Furnish (L) attend the wedding service for Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton.","If you're a fan of the royals, you've likely fantasized about what it's like to attend a royal wedding. And now that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's inevitable engagement looms near, your fantasies have likely kicked into overdrive.

But while we can only imagine what it's like to be a wedding guest, journalist Duncan Larcombe knows first-hand how glamourous the affair actually is.

Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day, April 29, 2011.

While we were glued to our TV screens watching Kate Middleton and Prince William get hitched in April 2011, Larcombe was actually among the 1,900 people at the service in Westminster Abbey.

The former royal editor of The Sun was one of six journalists who attended the nuptials. ""We were told in advance about two or three weeks before that we were invited, but we were told not to tell anybody,"" he told Elle U.K. in a recent interview. ""They wouldn't have wanted word to get out amongst other journalists.""

It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork.

So what was it like being among so many royals at the ceremony? According to Larcombe, it was just as surreal as we imagine.

""It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork,"" he said. ""It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. You know when you're there that you're watching history unfold in front of your eyes.""

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge kissing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.

""It's not like any wedding I've ever been to,"" he added. ""If you like people watching there's probably nothing better than a royal wedding. There isn't a room that has that many famous and royal people all under one roof.""

Larcombe also got to witness candid moments among the royals, including Prince William trying to compose himself beside brother Prince Harry before the ceremony (""[He] looked absolutely terrified""), and when complete silence filled the church when the Duchess of Cambridge finally arrived.

""All we could hear was the echoes of the crowds outside,"" he said.

Crowds gather on the mall prior to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

While Larcombe admitted that there was a lot of waiting around for the nuptials to begin, the event was well worth it. Not only did he get to see history in the making, but he revealed that every guest was treated as an equal — no matter how famous (or not famous) they were.

""It was quite clear at the wedding that no matter if you were the Sultan of Brunei or a guy who's been at Sandhurst with William, or a big Hollywood star, everyone got there early,"" he explained, noting that the Queen was the last to arrive and then the bride. ""I think for someone like Sir Elton John, who is normally one to be the centre of attention, it was probably quite humbling.""

Elton John (C) and partner David Furnish (L) attend the wedding service for Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Although there's much excitement over Prince Harry's possible engagement and wedding, his nuptials will likely be very different from his brother's, considering Harry is fifth-in-line (sixth-in-line when William and Catherine's third child arrives) to the throne and William is second. This means his and Markle's wedding will likely be more informal.

Last month, a source close to Harry told Us Weekly that a low-key wedding is more his style.

""Pomp and pageantry is the last thing he would want,"" the insider told the site. ""I can see him wanting to get married at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. It would stop it from turning into a total media circus and give the day a sense of privacy that Harry so badly craves.""

“The meeting was a failure; none of us understood what the point of it had been,” she told Bloomberg in an interview on Monday, referring to the meeting that Trump Jr. initially claimed was about the Magnitsky Act, which Congress passed in 2012 to punish Russian officials for human rights abuses.

“Looking ahead, if we come to power, we can return to this issue and think what to do about it,’’ Trump Jr. said during the meeting, according to Veselnitskaya. “I understand our side may have messed up, but it’ll take a long time to get to the bottom of it.”

The June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, which The New York Times uncovered this summer, has drawn close scrutiny from the multiple investigations into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia last year.

Trump Jr. took the meeting, which was also attended by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, after being told that the information on Clinton was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,’’ according to emails he released in response to the Times’ reporting.

INTERNATIONAL - Moins d'un an après l'élection de Donald Trump, le parti Démocrate se cherche déjà son leader pour la présidentielle de 2020. Il faut dire que l'affaire est compliquée. L'échec d'Hillary Clinton, la bonne performance de son adversaire de primaire Bernie Sanders, bien plus à gauche, et le coup d'éclat de Donald Trump, un candidat milliardaire et à la marge du parti Républicain, font de 2020 une élection de tous les possibles.

A tel point que certaines candidatures, qui peuvent sembler totalement hallucinantes, sont parfois envisagées sérieusement. C'est le cas de Mark Zuckerberg, le fondateur de Facebook. Celui-ci s'est lancé le défis de parler aux ""vrais gens"" des 50 états américains dans l'année, tout en s'entourant d'un ancien conseiller de Barack Obama. Suffisant pour que Donald Trump place le PDG sur sa liste de candidats potentiels pour 2020, malgré les démentis répétés du jeune milliardaire.

L'élection du candidat républicain semble avoir donné l'envie à d'autres stars du petit et grand écran de se lancer dans la course. A l'instar de Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, l'acteur de Fast and Furious, ou encore la célèbre présentatrice Oprah Winfrey.

Des favoris très âgés

S'il y a tout de même peu de chances de voir ces personnes à la tête des Etats-Unis en 2021, l'attention qui leur est portée symbolise surtout le manque d'une tête d'affiche à opposer à Trump dans le camp démocrate.

Dans une tribune publiée sur le New York Times, le journaliste Jason Zengerle fait le point sur les candidats potentiels, basée sur un document informel des stratèges du parti Démocrate listant 30 démocrates qui envisagent de se présenter. Ou devraient y penser vu leur notoriété. Le Washington Post s'est aussi essayé à l'exercice en septembre, tout en précisant qu'un tel exercice est évidemment bien périlleux: tout peut arriver d'ici 3 ans.

Parmi les personnalités citées, il y a deux favoris: Bernie Sanders, mais aussi Joe Biden, l'ancien vice-président d'Obama. Les deux candidats potentiels représentent parfaitement les courants qui écartèlent le parti Démocrate: le premier est très à gauche et le deuxième plutôt centriste. Ils bénéficient tous les deux d'une bonne aura. Bernie Sanders est même la personnalité politique préférée des Américains.

Le problème, c'est qu'en 2020, Sanders aura 79 ans et Biden 78 ans. Il faut se rappeler que Donald Trump est devenu le président américain le plus âgé en 2017, avec seulement 70 années au compteur.

Rien d'impossible pour autant. Un proche de Bernie Sanders a ainsi affirmé au journal The Hill qu'il envisageait de se représenter. Et si ce n'était pas le cas, il s'arrangerait pour présenter un autre candidat progressiste.

Elizabeth Warren, Sanders bis

Mais qui? Si plusieurs noms peuvent ressortir, celui d'Elizabeth Warren, sénateur du Massachusetts, retient le plus l'attention.

Connue aux Etats-Unis pour ses prises de positions à la gauche du parti Démocrate, elle est surtout devenue une icone féministe en février, lorsqu'on lui a confisqué la parole an Congrès. La phrase ""Nevertheless, she persisted"" (malgré tout, elle a persisté"") est devenue un vrai slogan sur les réseaux sociaux.

Pour le moment, Elizabeth Warren affirme en tout cas ne pas être intéressée. ""Je fais mon travail tous les jours. Je ne suis pas candidate pour être présidente"", a-t-elle précisé en août.

Si elle n'y va pas, Washington évoque également Kamala Harris pour prendre la relève de Bernie Sanders. La sénatrice de Californie a peu d'expérience mais est une figure montante du parti Démocrate.

Elle fut d'ailleurs la première à soutenir la loi de couverture médicale proposée par Sanders fin août. Cette réforme, qui n'a aucune chance de passer dans un parlement dominé par les Républicains, a ensuite été défendue par de nombreux démocrates.

Deval Patrick, le protégé d'Obama

Nul doute que pour remporter la primaire démocrate, le soutient de Barack Obama pourrait être utile. Et à ce petit jeu, c'est pour l'instant Deval Patrick, l'ancien gouverneur du Massachusetts, qui fait la course en tête.

En août, Politico affirmait que l'ancien président lui a conseillé, en privé, de réfléchir à se présenter. Les proches d'Obama, eux, l'encouragent publiquement.

Mais tout n'est pas rose pour Deval Patrick, loin de là, comme le rappelle Slate. Il travaille en effet pour Bain Capital, un fond d'investissement qui gère des dizaines de milliards de dollars. Pire: la société a été cofondée par Mitt Romney, l'ancien candidat républicain opposé à Barack Obama pour sa réélection et qui lui a valu beaucoup de critiques lors de la campagne électorale de 2012.

Il y a bien d'autres candidats potentiels, à l'instar du maire de Los Angeles Eric Garcetti, qui vient d'ailleurs de lancer un fond non-lucratif visant à récolter de l'argent pour des ""investissements d'innovation"" dans le pays.

Il y a également de grandes chances que le candidat démocrate qui affrontera Donald Trump dans trois ans ne soit pas dans cette liste.

Every year seems to go the same way. Suddenly the once desolate roads are blistering with enthusiastic joggers. Shopping bags are bulging with iron rich greens and fresh organic fruits that costs half your monthly wage. Hello Christmas detox... We always vow to ditch the junk food and create a body that looks like it has been carved by angels. That's until there is another sodding celebration at the office. But thank goodness for the internet, hey?

Social media is saturated with motivating mantras and chiselled men in spandex. The number of 'fitness gurus' who promise us mere mortals, that we will be better off following their 30 day plans is showing no signs of slowing. It seems everyone is an 'expert' in this industry nowadays. But before you are left sobbing into a box of left over sweet and sour chicken balls in sheer desperation on who to follow, ask yourself this... would you let a plumber give you a heart transplant?

We all know health and fitness fads come and go. Never are we short of celebrities endorsing some kind of 'miracle' investment with persuasive claims that their products WILL change your life forever. We can't deny some of them do help, but some.. we're still not sure what they do. ""But how do I bag myself a better body?"", I hear you cry... don't worry, your prayers have been answered. Here are a few of the top diet tips, busted, so you never have to feel compelled to buy into these segments of ""wisdom"" again.

1. Exercise Erases Week Long Binges.

10 minutes of cardio, check. 10 reps of bicep curls, check. Holding a wall squat for what seemed like forever, check, taking a 'gym selfie' because if you didn't take a photo, it didn't happen. Sound familiar? But before you have another snaccident and delve into a box of Krispe Kremes, I hate to break it to you, you can't out-exercise a crappy diet. Eating HAS to complement exercise. You wouldn't contour without highlight, or have Kenan without Kel. It's a calorie game, and unfortunately we underestimate the amount of gym sessions it takes to transform our bodies. Did you know it takes 90mins worth of running to burn off a chicken tikka? Yes! Put the poppadoms down!

2. Pasta Makes You Fat

For all of the packets of pasta out there longing to find a loving home. This is for you. Over the years we have all heard the statement 'cut out carbs'. Why though? Well it is based on the theory:

""When you eat carbohydrates, your body turns them into sugars, which are then stored as fat.""

Although there is some truth behind this statement, the reality is carbohydrates per se don't make you fat; extra calories do, whether you eat them in the form of carbs, fats, and yes, protein . Girl cancel the extra sides of chicken wings.

Carbohydrates include veggies, fruits, and grains, which are essential for a healthy diet. The problem isn't pasta!! But before you hold an Italian night inspired by Gino and Vino, remember, pasta in moderation is fine when sparingly added to a veggie dense meal.

3. Eat Fat-free Food

Wrong! Fat is not the enemy. Although fat-laden products like 'cake' can be full of calories, fat found in nuts and fish help the body absorb certain vitamins. Many fat free items you can buy are full of sugars and sweeteners. Remember you are sweet enough so you might want to check the label. We know a diet consisting of Chelsea buns and ice cream isn't going to end well. But as a whole... Fat doesn't make you fat!

4. The Holy Scale

I will tell you what to do with the scales. Burn them, use them as a doorstop, throw them out of the window. Quite frankly anything that stops them being used for their intended purpose. Scales can lie. For starters, you can step on the scales and see a loss of 3 pounds, but that loss may not even be from fat. It could be from water loss or whether you have taken your wig off. Hitting it hard at the gym and gaining muscle will make the scales show you putting on pounds. Muscle is more dense than fat, so despite losing body fat, the number on the scales will be higher. You may be slimmer, however the scales will tell you different.

5.Diet = Salads.

We have all done it, followed a prescriptive plan in desperation to squeeze into an outfit we wore as a youth. After a week, you have shifted the weight of a baby goat. Eating salad after salad and nothing but salads. This is not only monotonous, but blimin' boring. The reality is, short term on ANY plan that gets you to consuming less calories will equate to a loss. My darlings, salads are a side dish, not a meal.

Please meet Mr Navin Kumar Singh. He is now the living embodiment of the English phrase ""hoist with his own petard"".

Singh, a BJP spokesperson, wants to make Vande Mataram a litmus test for patriotism, especially for Muslims.

But when he was challenged on TV to sing it himself he massacred the song, despite peeping at the lyrics on his mobile phone.

As the Twitter handle History of India (@RealHistoryPic) tweeted, the new Navin version of the old song goes something like this

Vande Mataram

Sujlaam

Blah

Blah

Pulkistan

Sumita Dhumal

Tsunami

Suhasini

Vande Mataram.

Singh proved in one fell swoop that he does not know the lyrics of the song he wants everyone else to sing and he cannot read the lyrics off his phone either, a double whammy of incompetence.

You think by now the BJP would have given Vande Mataram lessons to its spokespersons who appear on television. Baldev Singh Aulakh, the minister of state for minority welfare in Uttar Pradesh, went into verbal diarrhea mode for almost six minutes to avoid singing just four lines of Vande Mataram on television. When Maharashtra made the song compulsory in civic schools, BJP MLA Raj Purohit wanted to extend the rule to all schools. But when asked to sing, he managed two lines and mangled them as well.

The problem is not that one does not know the Vande Mataram. The problem is the hypocrisy of insisting that everyone else take the Vande Mataram test to prove their patriotism, while you yourself flunk it spectacularly. This is not just a facepalm moment, it's a double standard to consider yourself exempt from what you want to impose on others. No one needs to prove their patriotism or get a patriotism certificate from others. But when the BJP decides to make Vande Mataram the Aadhaar card of patriotism, it needs to make sure its spokespersons are up to speed on it. They need to practise what they preach.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Jaipur has decided that civic employees also need a booster dose of patriotism. At 9:50 AM every morning they must sing the national anthem before biometric attendance closes. Around 5:55 PM before closing time they have to sing Vande Mataram.

""Nothing has more positive energy than the national song,"" said city mayor Ashok Lahoty. ""One should go home with the positive energy of the national song and give quality time to his family."" And anyone who does not like it can go to Pakistan. Of course.

Honestly this makes more sense than singing the national anthem before a movie and Navin Kumar Singh could come and take some singing lessons as well. But it also points to the ruling party's penchant for a kind of patriotism that does not well up from within but is imposed from without. This is patriotism by drill display, the louder the better even as the Supreme Court is noting that ""we don't have to wear patriotism on our sleeves.""

But that's exactly what we have to do. Or rather as Navin Singh proved that's what others have to do. Vande Mataram, a difficult song in Sanskritized Bengali is a particular favourite for some because they know some Muslims object to a song that worships the motherland as a Goddess. Jinnah had written in 1938 that Muslims refused to accept Vande Mataram or ""any expurgated edition of the anti-Muslim song as a binding national anthem"". Muslim clerics in Deoband issuing a fatwa against singing the song in 2009 have only helped to fan the flames.

Now it's become a roundabout way to trap them in an anti-national test, an old and tired controversy, settling old scores where Jana Gana Mana was chosen the national anthem over it. In Meerut. seven Muslim councilors walked out when Vande Mataram was being sung. When they returned they were not allowed in. Mayor Harikant Ahluwalia said ""It was the decision of everyone in the session that those who boycott the national song should be boycotted."" Unfortunately as Navin Singh has proved sometimes the BJP's own leaders fall into their own carefully laid trap. It also proves that these leaders are not so moved by Vande Mataram the song, as they are excited by its potential to bait Muslims as not sufficiently loyal to the motherland.

Vande Mataram is a wonderful song, an important piece of India's freedom movement. As is Sare Jahaan Se Accha. The BJP is more than welcome to promote it but as the Supreme Court has clarified there is no concept of a national song in the Constitution. The bench observed that Article 51A of fundamental duties does not refer to a national song, only to the national flag and the national anthem when a BJP leader approached the court praying for a government policy to ""promote"" the song. Undeterred the Vande Mataram Confederation held a two-wheeler rally in Fatehpura to promote the song and make people aware of it ahead of its November 7 anniversary.

Yogi Adityanath has called opposition to ""Vande Mataram"" an example of ""narrow-mindedness"". But what his cohorts like Navin Singh display when it comes to the song is something far more reprehensible – rank hypocrisy.

Von Jenna B.

Ihr wisst sicher einiges über Depressionen.

Ihr wisst, dass Menschen mit Depressionen sich oft traurig und leer fühlen, keinen Appetit haben oder schlecht schlafen können. Dass sie müde sind und dass ihnen Dinge keine Freude mehr bereiten, die sie normalerweise lieben würden. Und dass sie vielleicht sogar an den Tod und ans Sterben denken.

Doch ein Symptom von Depressionen, von dem ihr wahrscheinlich noch nicht gehört habt und gleichzeitig eines, das mit am schwersten zu ertragen ist: Einsamkeit.

Wir Menschen sehnen uns nach Nähe. Sogar die meisten Introvertierten wollen mit kleinen Gruppen oder einzelnen Personen in Interaktion treten.

Doch wenn ich mich depressiv fühle, kann ich mich selbst nicht dazu bringen, Verabredungen auszumachen oder einzuhalten. Manchmal kann ich nicht mal duschen und mich anziehen, geschweige denn das Haus verlassen.

Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut

Doch das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Gesellschaft möchte. Im Gegenteil: Ich wünsche mir so sehr, dass jemand bei mir ist, dass es weh tut. Doch ich habe Angst, jemanden zu fragen.

Ich weiß, dass ich andere damit belaste. Und ich weiß auch, dass es keinen Spaß macht, mit mir Zeit zu verbringen, weil ich immer traurig bin und es mir schwer fällt, die Dinge zu genießen, die ich früher gerne mochte.

Ich fühle mich schuldig, dass ich diese Gesellschaft möchte, dass ich jemanden in meiner Nähe brauche.

Wenn ich mich sehr schlimm niedergeschlagen fühle, sehne ich mich nach jemanden, mit dem ich sprechen kann und der mich versteht, ohne mich zu verurteilen. Doch ich bekomme meinen Mund nicht auf, um nach der Hilfe zu fragen, die ich brauche.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt

Ich bin gefangen in meinem eigenen Kopf und ich kann mich innerlich schreien hören. Doch leider kann niemand meine Gedanken lesen.

Je stärker meine Depression wird, desto isolierter fühle ich mich von der Außenwelt und desto weniger Kraft habe ich, mit anderen Menschen in Kontakt zu treten. Doch das ist genau der Zeitpunkt, an dem ich am meisten auf jemanden angewiesen bin, der sieht, was mit mir los ist.

Es ist traurig, dass die Symptome von Depressionen dafür sorgen, dass du so viele Freunde verlierst. Wegen des Stigmas, das der Krankheit anhaftet, oder weil sie nicht verstehen oder Angst haben oder nicht wissen, wie sie helfen sollen. Oder weil sie beschäftigt sind und nicht gestört werden wollen.

Denn manchmal ist der beste Weg, einem Freund oder geliebten Person mit Depressionen zu begegnen, einfach Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen und zu tun, wonach ihm ist.

Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen

Auch wenn das nur ein Netflix-Abend auf der Couch ist oder ein gemeinsamer Kaffee oder ein Abendessen. Allein dadurch, dass du dich um deinen Freund oder deine Freundin kümmerst, hilft ihm oder ihr, sich besser zu fühlen.

Sogar wenn der Andere deine Worte der Beschwichtigung und des Trostes nicht zu hören scheint, kann deine Anwesenheit sehr wertvoll für ihn sein. Es tut immer gut zu wissen, dass jemand sich um dich sorgt und aufrichtige, liebevolle Worte zu hören.

Mir hilft das immer sehr, wenn ich depressiv bin. Es erinnert mich daran, dass ich diese Liebe verdient habe und hilft mir, an meiner Selbstliebe zu arbeiten, die mich aus der Depression herausziehen kann.

Wenn ihr also einen Freund oder Liebsten habt, der unter Depressionen leidet, erinnert euch bitte immer daran: Es ist so wichtig, mit ihm oder ihr Zeit zu verbringen. Depressionen sind eine Krankheit, die sehr einsam macht. Und Nähe zu anderen Menschen ist extrem wichtig bei der Genesung.

Alla fine, sebbene il lento scrutinio avesse lasciato accesa l'ultima speranza, il verdetto è impietoso: per Alternativa popolare le elezioni siciliane sono una debacle. Un disastro soprattutto per Angelino Alfano e quell'area più filo governativa che ha voluto l'alleanza con il Pd a sostegno di Fabrizio Micari. Il leader centrista non nasconde il ""risultato negativo"", ma rivendica: ""Anche se non abbiamo ottenuto i risultati sperati, non abbiamo rimpianti perché abbiamo fatto la scelta giusta"".

Una scelta che, però, fu fatta a dispetto dell'ala nordista, guidata da Maurizio Lupi, che guardava al centrodestra e - anche a fronte del veto di Salvini - avrebbe comunque preferito una corsa solitaria. Una decisione che dunque si è rivelata fallimentare e che brucia ancora di più sulla pelle del ministro degli Esteri che nella natale Agrigento ha, o a questo punto aveva, il suo piccolo feudo. E che ora corre il rischio di ritrovarsi minoranza nel partito che lui stesso ha costruito.

Non superare il 5% vuol dire infatti non avere nemmeno un seggio, dunque neanche una briciola di potere contrattuale quando Nello Musumeci andrà a cercare ""rinforzi"" per formare il governo. Perché è esattamente questo lo scenario che prefiguravano molti notabili locali di Ap che in numerosi comizi, spudoratamente, chiedevano il voto per i propri candidati in lista, ma poi suggerivano di votare per il governatore del centrodestra. I dati lo confermano: il sostegno di Alfano ha portato a Micari poco e niente, al centro è risultata assai più credibile la proposta dell'Udc di Lorenzo Cesa per Musumeci. Ed ecco che sotto quella soglia, reale e psicologica allo stesso tempo, è già partito quel processo di disgregazione in realtà strisciante da tempo. I big per ora scelgono la strada della prudenza, Maurizio Lupi approfitta del provvidenziale viaggio a New York per la maratona, e sfrutta il fuso rinviando ogni commento.

Ma il dado sembra ormai tratto e la linea che emergerà è: basta alleanza con il Pd, bisogna guardare al centrodestra. Lo ""sfogatoio"" è già pronto: per sabato a Roma è in programma una conferenza organizzativa di Ap, e i ""critici"" già affilano le armi. Esplicitamente ne parla Roberto Formigoni: ""C'è un'unica cosa che Alternativa Popolare non deve fare dopo le elezioni siciliane: riproporre a livello nazionale - sostiene - l'alleanza con il Pd. È questa l'indicazione chiara che ci viene dai nostri elettori, sia pure a risultati non definitivi"". L'ex hovernatore lombardo invita anche a mollare il governo, già a cominciare dalla legge di bilancio.

Lupi, che proprio per scongiurare scollamenti Alfano ha nominato qualche mese fa coordinatore del partito, per il momento continua a dire che la strada di Ap dovrebbe essere quella di andare da soli alle Politiche. Ma l'ex ministro sa bene che con il Rosatellum questo percorso è poco praticabile. E, infatti, c'è chi giura che in realtà ormai da tempo abbia stretto un accordo con Silvio Berlusconi per tornare nel centrodestra. E a quel punto l'implosione sara inevitabile: si tratta solo di capire se i filo governativi - due nomi tra tutti Fabrizio Cicchitto e Beatrice Lorenzin - se ne andranno di loro spontanea volontà o se saranno accompagnati alla porta.

Né sarebbe un problema il veto che da tempo il leader della Lega ha posto su un ritorno di Ap. Il modo per superare questa impasse sarebbe già pronto: ""sacrificare"" Angelino Alfano, non candidarlo, lasciarlo al suo destino, magari a cercare un ""salvacondotto"" con il Pd.

Joseph Weizenbaum se rendit compte que beaucoup d'utilisateurs de cette machine devenaient de plus en plus dépendants émotionnellement de leur relation avec Eliza.
Et que va faire Woebot si un étudiant lui confie participer à des viols collectifs?","Quand on pense aux différents métiers qui pourraient disparaître du fait de la robotisation, il y a en a un auquel on ne pense en général jamais: le métier de psychothérapeute. Eh bien si! La preuve en est qu'une entreprise a développé pour le compte de Facebook une intelligence artificielle capable de fonctionner comme psychothérapeute pour les adolescents déprimés. La chose s'appelle Woebot.

Le modèle des thérapies comportementales et cognitives

Son modèle est celui des thérapies comportementales et cognitives (TCC). Comme les thérapeutes appartenant à cette école, il s'adresse aux patients déprimés en essayant de ""redresser"" les représentations erronées qu'ils sont censés se faire d'eux-mêmes et du monde. Par exemple, si un patient dit: ""Personne ne m'apprécie"", le thérapeute répond : ""Je suis sûr que ce n'est pas vrai, il y a des gens qui vous apprécient, mais vous ne vous en rendez pas compte parce que vous êtes dans un ""cycle de pensées négatives"". Réfléchissons ensemble. Il y a bien un domaine dans lequel vous réussissez, etc."" C'est ce qu'on appelle le remodelage cognitif.

A la différence des psychanalystes, ces thérapeutes ne cherchent donc pas à savoir si une raison particulière a pu distordre le jugement du patient. Ils ne prennent pas non plus en compte le transfert, c'est à dire et la façon dont chaque patient appréhende son thérapeute différemment. Pour eux, tous les thérapeutes bien formés sont censés travailler exactement de la même façon et obtenir les mêmes résultats – bien que certains d'entre eux reconnaissent en privé que leur personnalité intervient dans les réponses du patient à la méthode. La théorie prescrit d'éliminer au maximum les interférences liées aux relations humaines. Le thérapeute n'est rien et le protocole est tout. Les TCC ont en cela remis à la mode la méthode du Docteur Coué : ""Levez-vous chaque matin en vous disant : ""je suis quelqu'un de bien"" et vous vous sentirez de mieux en mieux"". L'objectif est d'inviter le patient à adopter une vision plus positive de son quotidien. Cela marche quand il se le dit à lui-même, et aussi quand c'est un robot qui le lui dit !

Une étude menée auprès de 70 étudiants répartis en deux groupes, dont les résultats ont été publiés en juin (The Journal of Medical Internet Research Mental Health), montre que des échanges menés avec Woebot pendant 15 jours sont plus efficaces que la consultation d'un e-book. La comparaison n'a pas été menée avec un thérapeute réel. Le but était seulement de voir ce qui peut pallier le mieux au manque de thérapeutes, pas de démontrer qu'il faudrait en augmenter le nombre. Cela est en effet exclu pour diverses raisons, dont la budgétaire n'est pas la moindre...

Le robot peut-il être un bon thérapeute?

Au risque d'étonner, oui, et dans certains cas, un robot peut même être un meilleur thérapeute qu'un humain! Cela a été démontré aux États-Unis pour les militaires coupables ou honteux d'actes de guerre ayant entraîné la mort de civils innocents. Un avatar numérique sur un écran, appelé ""Sim Coach"", recueille leurs confidences plus efficacement qu'un humain. Tout d'abord, derrière l'écran de son ordinateur ou de son téléphone, la peur d'être jugé s'estomperait. Il serait plus facile de parler à un algorithme. Par ailleurs, l'avatar n'a jamais de mimiques d'étonnement, et encore moins de réprobation. Il ne court donc pas le risque de renvoyer à son insu au patient la culpabilité ou la honte. C'est dans l'absence d'interférences humaines, c'est-à-dire de projections du thérapeute sur le patient et du patient sur le thérapeute, que résiderait la plus grande efficacité du robot. Mais un tel échange est-il bien vierge de toute projection? Si celles qui concernent la gêne ou la honte à aborder certains sujets s'estompent, il semble bien que d'autres apparaissent, non moins problématiques...

L'effet Elisa

L'informaticien Joseph Weizenbaum a écrit, dans les années 1960, un programme, baptisé Eliza, qui simulait un psychothérapeute rogerien. Le patient utilisait un clavier pour parler à la machine et celle-ci lui répondait sur un écran. Le programme consistait à reformuler les affirmations de l'interlocuteur sur un mode interrogatif, ou bien à extraire de son affirmation quelques mots qu'il recombinait autrement. Quand Eliza ne trouvait rien dans la phrase précédente qui lui permette de construire une réponse plus adaptée, il écrivait ""Je comprends..."". Joseph Weizenbaum se rendit compte que beaucoup d'utilisateurs de cette machine devenaient de plus en plus dépendants émotionnellement de leur relation avec Eliza. Et en plus, ils avaient beau avoir conscience des limites de la programmation d'Eliza, ils ne pouvaient pas s'empêcher de penser que la machine se préoccupait d'eux. Comme le déclara Joseph Weizenbaum, de courtes interactions avec ce programme informatique relativement simple étaient capables d'induire des pensées délirantes chez des personnes pourtant normales! Les usagers étaient frappés de ""dissociation cognitive"". Or si Eliza était capable de tels effets, la relation que nous aurons de plus en plus avec les robots va mobiliser des projections et des croyances bien plus considérables encore.

La capture des données

Mais pourquoi Facebook s'est-il lancé dans cette aventure? Est-ce parce que la firme a pris conscience de la misère psychologique de beaucoup d'adolescents? Mais si c'était le cas, pourquoi n'aurait-elle pas décidé de financer l'ouverture de centres de consultations et de prise en charge des souffrances étudiantes sur les campus? Il suffit ici de rappeler le modèle économique de Facebook pour le comprendre. Cette entreprise vit de la capture des données personnelles de ses usagers qu'elle utilise ou qu'elle revend. Cela assure déjà Woebot de bénéficier de beaucoup d'informations pour poser les bonnes questions à ceux qui décident de l'utiliser: il exploite tout ce que son utilisateur a mis de lui sur Facebook, ou que ses proches ont mis sur lui. Mais les confidences qui lui sont faites constituent en même temps autant de nouvelles données personnelles que Facebook va pouvoir exploiter. Autrement dit, Woebot n'est finalement qu'un râteau plus fin qui va permettre à Facebook de ratisser bien mieux nos données les plus intimes, au risque même d'y agréger des données médicales qui devraient rester confidentielles. Et que va faire Woebot si un étudiant lui confie participer à des viols collectifs? Et qui sera responsable s'il apparaît que l'utilisation de Woebot aggrave la santé mentale d'un patient?

Il y a une quinzaine d'années, une publicité pour une grande marque japonaise de produits numériques (Toshiba si ma mémoire est bonne) montrait un samouraï s'approcher d'une geisha qui esquissait un geste de refus en répétant deux fois: ""Arrète (suivi du nom de la marque)"". Puis cette image disparaissait et on voyait un écran sur lequel il était écrit: ""Rien n'arrête (et le nom de la marque)"". Facebook ne fera évidemment jamais une telle publicité, et pourtant elle correspondrait exactement au viol de nos données personnelles que réalise à son bénéfice le petit soldat Woebot...

No es el acto más ofensivo que ha hecho, eso lo sabemos gracias a Anthony Rapp. El incidente descrito por Rapp en BuzzFeed ocurrió unos años antes que el mío y, lo que es aún peor, Rapp se encontraba extrañamente aislado. Cuando leí su declaración de lo ocurrido, me sentí aliviado, podía haber sido mucho peor.

Afortunadamente no fue así. Los caminos de Rapp y el mío nunca llegaron a cruzarse, él es algo mayor que yo, pero tengo la sensación de que tuvimos infancias similares. No creo que exista un sentimiento de ""fraternidad"" entre antiguos actores jóvenes, aunque todos sabemos lo extraña que podía resultar a veces esta experiencia. A día de hoy, cuando le cuento a mi mujer cómo me pasaba tres horas diarias en los sets de rodaje o que pasaba varias horas después del colegio en un coche dirección a Nueva York (Estados Unidos) para hacer tres castings, niega con la cabeza y concluye: ""Tuviste una infancia rara"".

Quizá. Pero me encantó. No tanto el hecho de actuar. Lo dejé cuando alcancé la edad adulta, y me interesaba bastante más John Milton que Al Pacino. Pero lo que me encantaba eran las oportunidades que me ofrecía: viajar, quedarme despierto hasta más tarde que mis compañeros de clase y que me trataran como a un adulto. Y lo que es más importante, conocí a algunas de las personas más interesantes que he conocido nunca. Muchas de mis percepciones del mundo a día de hoy se deben al privilegio que tuve con mi ""extraña"" infancia.

Kevin Spacey y yo estuvimos juntos en el reparto original de Lost in Yonkers en 1991. Nos entendimos estupendamente. Es un tío muy afable y gracioso, como sabe cualquiera que le haya visto en Saturday Night Live. Causa muy buena impresión, es fácil hablar con él y es muy divertido. Recuerdo que me fascinaba esa característica cicatriz en su cara, pero me daba miedo preguntarle por ella. Aunque estoy seguro de que no le habría importado que lo hiciera. Nunca olvidaré aquella fría noche en la que estuvimos sentados en la entrada de un hotel en Winston-Salem (Carolina del Norte, Estados Unidos). Hablamos sobre la obra, sobre mis vicisitudes de adolescente, sobre su edad (por algún motivo me costaba creer que solo tuviera 32 años). Fue una noche bonita. Fue encantador conmigo y con mis padres, y recuerdo irme a la cama contento de que Kevin Spacey fuera mi amigo.

En Nueva York, la obra de teatro fue muy alabada por las críticas y ganó un montón de Tony Awards. Kevin y yo éramos compañeros en uno de los mayores éxitos de Broadway. Nos hicimos buenos amigos. Salíamos juntos a cenar, charlábamos entre bastidores y una mañana incluso planeamos que yo fuera a su apartamento entre obra y obra. Sin embargo, normalmente estábamos en su vestuario. Kevin tenía uno de los vestuarios más lujosos en la otra parte del teatro. Era muy espacioso. Había un sofá y una televisión y uno de esos espejos elegantes de Hollywood con bombillas alrededor. Pasamos muchas noches ahí antes de salir al escenario, viendo partidos de baloncesto, especialmente los desempates.

Nos hicimos buenos amigos. Salíamos juntos a cenar, charlábamos entre bastidores y una mañana incluso planeamos que yo fuera a su apartamento entre obra y obra. Sin embargo, normalmente estábamos en su vestuario .

Ocurrió una de esas noches, estábamos viendo a los Celtics en la televisión y Kevin Spacey puso su mano en mi muslo. Mentiría si dijera que recuerdo las circunstancias exactas o la altura a la que puso su mano. Tengo trastorno obsesivo compulsivo diagnosticado, y a menudo no me fío de mi memoria. De hecho, acabo de hablar por teléfono con mi madre y dice que ni siquiera ese día fui capaz de decirlo con total seguridad. Pero sabe que estaba asustado. Y, sabiendo que su hijo no solía inventarse historias para llamar la atención, vino a recogerme para que no tuviera que ir a casa de Kevin. Creo que fue mi trastorno obsesivo compulsivo lo que detuvo a mis padres. Ellos tenían que hacerse cargo de un niño que escribía listas absurdas de sentimientos de culpabilidad, que se había desnudado en un supermercado con 4 años debido a un impulso inexplicable y estaba obsesionado con el número cinco. ¿Quizá esto no era más que otra manifestación de la enfermedad que todavía desconocían?

De modo que no dijimos nada, ni hicimos nada. Y, si soy totalmente sincero, hasta hoy nunca había pensado en hablar sobre esto, ni siquiera siendo adulto. Es más, a menudo he usado esta historia como la típica historia que cuentas en una fiesta, algo para llamar la atención de las personas medio borrachas sentadas en círculo cerca de los aperitivos. Y, a menudo, concluía la historia con un comentario casual del tipo: ""Todo el mundo sabe esto sobre Spacey"".

Ahora, cuando pienso en esos momentos, me avergüenzo de ello.

Aún no alcanzo a entender por qué estoy escribiendo sobre esto, por qué la declaración de Anthony Rapp me ha impulsado a sentarme y a buscar las palabras adecuadas. Supongo que la respuesta más sencilla es que escribir es mi vida. Empleo las palabras para aclarar mis ideas. Nunca llego a entender algo por completo hasta que he escrito sobre ello. Ese momento con Kevin nunca me causó mucho impacto, no estoy seguro de por qué. Unos años después del incidente, incluso acepté una invitación suya para ver Glengarry Glen Ross. Pero hay algo más, algo a lo que llevo dándole vueltas desde que Rapp alzo la voz. Lo mejor que se me ocurre es lo siguiente.

En 1951 William Faulkner escribió: ""El pasado nunca muere. Ni siquiera es pasado"". Y de eso se trata. No podemos escapar de nuestro pasado. ni yo, Ni Spacey, ni Rapp. Yo me tomé la situación que ocurrió con Spacey como una broma, una historia que contar en fiestas. Y ahora me enfrento a la seriedad de algo que tanto yo como mis padres, deberíamos haber afrontado de manera diferente. En cuanto a Kevin, ha sido capaz de evitar este tema durante muchos años. Pero no ahora, ya es suficiente.

Kevin ha sido capaz de evitar este tema durante muchos años. Pero no ahora, ya es suficiente.

Quiero ser generoso y decir que, de alguna manera, Kevin también ha sufrido, ya que vivimos en una sociedad que castiga a las personas por ser sinceras. La pedofilia es un trastorno psiquiátrico por el que alguien siente atracción por niños preadolescentes. Hay muchísimas personas que tienen estos sentimientos pero no actúan al respecto. ¿Qué hubiera pasado si a Kevin Spacey se le hubiera dado la oportunidad de hablar de sus atracciones sin miedo o sin una sanción cultural? ¿Seguiría candente este debate?

Pero Kevin, actor de éxito, tenía más oportunidades que la mayoría para conseguir ayuda. De hecho, en su disculpa no se responsabiliza de su comportamiento, y combina su sexualidad con la pedofilia. Me gustaría perdonarle. Me gustaría pensar que es redimible, aunque solo sea por el hecho de que me salgo con la mía con esta despreocupada respuesta. Pero hasta que Kevin no se sincere, no merecerá ser absuelto por sus pecados, que ni siquiera parece comprender.

En lo que refiere a Anthony Rapp, aplaudo su decisión de alzar la voz, pese a tener que meter el dedo en la llaga. Él también sabe que no se trata solo de eso. Como señaló Rapp en su Twitter: ""Yo saqué a la luz mi historia, animado por muchas mujeres valientes y hombres que han hablado para arrojar luz sobre esta situación y tratar de cambiarla, como ha sido mi caso"". Tiene razón. Lo cierto es que esto es una historia interminable con una lista interminable de héroes y víctimas. Y muchas personas de por medio.

Nunca volví al vestuario de Kevin. Seguro que él se dio cuenta de que me pasaba algo. Y trató de ser simpático. Yo fui el primero de los personajes originales en irme de Lost in Yonkers. De hecho, Manny Azenberg, el productor de la obra, me permitió terminar mi contrato antes de tiempo para poder ir a California (Estados Unidos) a grabar Brooklyn Bridge.

Hasta que Kevin no se sincere, no merecerá ser absuelto por sus pecados, que ni siquiera parece comprender.

Después de mi última obra, la mayoría del reparto y del equipo fueron a McHale's, un bar irlandés que ya no sigue abierto. Allí estaba Daisy Eagan, que ese año ganó un premio Tony con 11 años. Habíamos estado juntos en Los Miserables hacía algunos años. Kevin estaba muy animado. Incluso hay una fotografía nuestra de aquella noche: él me levantaba y sonreía para la cámara. Yo, agitando piernas y brazos, disimulaba mi angustia. Más tarde, me dio una consola Atari Lynx como regalo de despedida. No venía en una caja y ya había un juego dentro de la consola. Es como si la hubiera comprado para él y después hubiera pensado que era una buena manera de caerme bien.

I'm definitely not the first one to get picked on.","Matildas midfielder Tameka Butt loves to cause her opposition a bit of chaos.

She's played football in six different countries across four continents throughout her professional career and has performed for Australia's national women's team for a decade.

And while she's recently been tearing up pitches in Norway for Klepp Elite -- she's currently a nominee for Best Midfielder and Best Player in the Toppserien League's season awards -- Butt attributes her footballing prowess to a childhood game she used to play at school.

The 26-year-old, who was born in Orange in New South Wales' central west and now lives on the Gold Coast, has also just landed back in Australia for the 10th season of the national W-League on the back of some impressive Matildas victories.

So, how exactly is it that a teenage Tameka Butt converted her skill in a playground game to some serious ability on the football pitch? HuffPost Australia spoke to her to find out.

It's safe to say she's a fan favourite.

Luke: Tameka, your name was pretty popular in the HuffPost Australia office for a while because you're the star Matildas player that scored the winning goal in Australia's first-ever victory over the United States in July. I bet it felt pretty great to see that one hit the back of the net?

Tameka: I think I was pretty excited not so much for myself but more for the team, every time we face the US we're like, 'come on this time let's get the win'. This time it was actually reality.

Luke: Australia has played the US 28 times, so by now you must be familiar with a lot of their players. How was the banter on the pitch when you realised you had scored?

Tameka: We obviously know the USA and have been trying to beat them for a long time but we all had this confidence about us knowing that all of our players were in form and coming to peak performance. We all kind of knew that we had, collectively as a team, the talent to beat them... When the goal went in, it was a bit of confirmation for the girls that it was our game and that we deserved it.

Luke: You looked pretty calm and comfortable in front of that goal. Has that always been one of your strengths as a player -- being confident in front of the goalkeepers of big-name countries?

Tameka: I think it kind of comes in the moment. It doesn't really depend on what team you're playing, it's just how composed you are at the time. There's been plenty of shots where I've rushed it against weaker teams and others that I've placed easily. It all comes down to your composure in that split second.

Luke: It certainly looked like a pretty quick split second! How do you prepare yourself for those moments?

Tameka: It comes with the experience -- the more game time you get, the more composure you have under those pressure situations. Training sessions are meant to simulate game play but there's nothing quite like the real pressure as what's in a game.

Luke: So, what is it about your style of play that scares some of the opposition teams you have come up against with the Matildas? Is there something about you that gets opponents a little nervous to face you?

Tameka: One of the best dynamics about my game, as I play in the number 10 role [which is generally an attacking midfield position], is being kind of a late runner from deep. That means it's very hard to catch me offside and it's like a third-man run, so I'm running off the shoulder of someone who's marking someone else. It's a little bit like ghosting, I have that dynamic in my game which can cause the opposition a bit of chaos.

I have that dynamic in my game which can cause the opposition a bit of chaos.

Luke: Ghosting? As in, that funny trend where you run behind somebody while trying not to get noticed? Is that something you practice in your training sessions?

Tameka: It used to be a pretty good joke at school -- I did it a lot then. When I was younger we all had a running joke that someone would have to 'ghost' someone in a game to get points. For the goal against the US, it was a little bit like that. I was a late runner and the ball got knocked into my path and it caught the defence asleep a little bit.

Luke: Hang on, so how did this scoring system work in school and how did you get good at the game?

Tameka: It was me and a group of five boys. If someone saw you ghosting somebody -- walking behind them so they couldn't see you -- you'd get a tally to your name and the winner would get a can of Coca-Cola or a Mars Bar.

Years of ghosting practice means no one gets near Tameka unless she says so.

Luke: Right! Well then, is there anything else Australia should know about Tameka Butt that we don't already know?

Tameka: I guess I kind of do have another little hobby off the field, aside from surfing. I actually study a lot and I'm about to complete a double master degree. I'm doing a Master in Business which specialises in Sport Management and a Masters with Marketing.

Luke: That must be pretty full-on when it comes to juggling your studies with football. How do you fit it all in?

Tameka: I think I've been pretty lucky. I go to Griffith University and they have a sports school that's absolutely amazing and helps other Matildas go through as well. I think I've been pretty lucky with the institute that I've been able to do it with and also I've had time -- I'm 26 now and it's taken me that long to get my degree.

Luke: So, sport management and marketing -- is that an area you'd like to move into in the future?

Tameka: I definitely want to have a part in making women's sport bigger and making it more marketable. I definitely want to use the fact that I've got my foot in the sports industry to start doing that while I'm still playing.

Luke: Speaking of making women's sport bigger -- what are your thoughts on the Collective Bargaining Agreement that was reached this year to give Australia's female footballers a payrise? It's a big step in the right direction but the deal has its drawbacks.

Tameka: I was definitely part of a group that got together and made that all happen. It was a massive step in the right direction then and now I see it as more of a platform that we need to keep growing on. It's not a peak that we've reached at all -- it's not close to equality but it's a step forward in the right direction and we can't go below that now. We've built ourselves a platform to continue growing with.

Tameka was part of the player group pushing for higher wages for Australia's female footballers -- and that's something to smile about.

Luke: Just going back to your time in Norway for a moment -- earlier this month your Matildas teammate Caitlin Foord wrote an interesting blog piece talking about her struggles with homesickness while playing in Japan. Norway is pretty far from Orange or the Gold Coast, have you ever had similar struggles?

Tameka: Yeah definitely. I think early on, going overseas I struggled. The first place I struggled was Germany. I was in the US before that but it wasn't a massive culture change whereas when I went to Germany, it was a lot harder for me to break into the team and make friends and I got pretty homesick and that was a learning curve for me. The point where you decide to push on and make your time there worth it is when it turns around for you.

Luke: What did you do to cope in those tough moments?

Tameka: I think I learnt how to be a more outspoken person. I would speak to all my teammates and put my input in. Generally, I'm not that talkative but I had to push myself to get out of that comfort zone and that's when I think I started getting more accepted by my teammates and having a valued opinion.

Enjoying the company 💙💜 and the new experience here in #Norway 👍🏽✌🏽#KleppElite2017 https://t.co/JpeUXzqlFI — Tameka Butt (@TamekaButt) March 26, 2017

Luke: Now, as for the Matildas, you've played with them since you were 16-years-old in 2007 and a decade is a very long time to consistently be doing any one thing -- surely that makes you a veteran of sorts in the team?

Tameka: Yeah, I think so -- I've got to that age where I definitely feel like a veteran. I feel like I was a baby for a long time and now I definitely feel a lot older. Throughout my years with the Matildas, there's been a lot of changes and players come and go and right now we've got the youngest squad that we've ever really had I think.

Luke: Do you ever get picked on for being one of the oldies?

Tameka: No, I think there's others that get picked on a little more than me, perhaps [Lisa] De Vanna. She's been around a lot longer than me. I'm definitely not the first one to get picked on. I think the fact that I'm quite short, people also forget that I'm a bit older.

Matildas star Lisa De Vanna is the oldest player in the women's national team -- which means she cops a bit of stick, according to Tameka.

Luke: Okay, so in the last 10 years has there been a stand-out moment or experience that you've had with the national team that you rate as your most memorable?

Tameka: I don't know if I could pick one thing, I've had a couple of goals that I've set for myself so I think just reaching those goals, it's not a specific moment. Going to the World Cup in 2011 and 2015 were major goals of mine and then the Olympics as well.

Luke: Do you still get nervous running out to big events like those? How do you cope with that?

Tameka: Yeah definitely. I think nerves is an important part to going out and playing a match... When I was a lot younger I used to get a lot more nervous and feel a bit sick, but now I've learnt to not think about the game the whole day. I do something else in the morning, whether that's maybe study or watch a TV series or something but making sure my mind doesn't switch onto it too early is the key for me.

Luke: Just lastly, the Matildas have been absolutely flying this year in terms of their form in matches so I have to put it to you -- when can Australians expect you to win a World Cup? Surely it's on its way?

Tameka: That's what's kind of making this next four-year cycle so exciting. We probably do have the best Matildas team right now that we've ever had and that's been built with moments like with [coach Alen Stajcic] coming in and the players coming of age and a having a mixture of experience and youth. We definitely have one of the best Matildas teams that we've had but also, we're kind of peaking at the right time. There are lot of other nations that are rebuilding and others that are coming up strong and we've picked the right time and the opportunity is there to win the World Cup or the Olympics and take the number one spot.

Luke: Tameka Butt, thanks so much for speaking to HuffPost Australia.

Saudi King Salman announced late on Saturday the creation of a new anti-corruption committee chaired by his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said the body had detained 11 princes, four current ministers and tens of former ministers. The crown prince is spearheading an ambitious economic reform programme that aims to draw more foreign and private sector investment into the kingdom, which is the world's top oil exporter and the most powerful country in the Gulf Arab region.

King Salman also appointed two new ministers on Saturday to key security and economic posts, removing one of the royal family's most prominent members as head of the National Guard.

Prince Miteb bin Abdullah was replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favour of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

The Cabinet reshuffle helped to consolidate Prince Mohammed's control of the kingdom's security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Gomez and Bieber reconnected earlier this week as news spread that Gomez split from singer The Weeknd after 10 months together. The former couple was spotted together again on Wednesday.

This time around, the two were seen biking in Los Angeles, flashing big smiles and laughing together. Bieber rocked an oversized red sweatshirt and matching shoes, while Gomez looked super cozy in an all-gray ensemble.

The two were later photographed cuddling up to each other, with Gomez seen leaning her head on Bieber’s shoulder during a stop for coffee.

Neither Gomez nor Bieber has addressed the rumors of a rekindled relationship, but if a casual bike ride in comfy clothing with your ex doesn’t scream “we’re dating again,” then consider us highly suspicious.

The singers famously dated on and off from 2011 to 2015, forming the monolithic entity “Jelena,” which inspired leagues of young fans to feverishly root for the couple’s success.

But break up they did. Both seemed to have moved on personally and professionally ― save for a shady Instagram comment here and there.

Bieber has been linked to a handful of women since splitting from Gomez, including Sofia Richie and Haley Baldwin. Meanwhile, the “Fetish” singer began dating The Weeknd (aka Abel Tesfaye) sometime around January 2017.

Die Sexismus-Debatte wirft viele komplexe Fragen auf

Eine der drängendsten: Was ist der Grund, dass sexuelle Belästigung überhaupt noch so weit verbreitet ist?

Ein Sozialpsychologe erklärt, was er für die Hauptursache hält

Wie kommt es, dass Sexismus in unserer Gesellschaft noch immer so weit verbreitet ist? Was bringt Männer dazu, Frauen zu belästigen und ihnen im schlimmsten Fall sogar sexuelle Gewalt anzutun? Und was muss geschehen, dass sich etwas ändert?

Was als Hollywood-Skandal um den Produzenten Harvey Weinstein begann, hat sich schnell zu einer mächtigen und sehr emotional geführten Sexismus-Debatte entwickelt, die viele Fragen aufwirft.

Die meisten davon sind alles andere als einfach zu beantworten. Der Sozialpsychologe Rolf Pohl ist deshalb der Ansicht: Um die Kultur zwischen Männern und Frauen zu ändern, müssen wir zunächst verstehen, was der Auslöser der Diskriminierung ist.

Psychologisches Dilemma für viele Männer

""Es wird zu wenig über die Motivation hinter Sexismus und sexueller Belästigung gesprochen"", sagte er dem Nachrichten-Webseite ""Stern"". ""Einerseits sollen Männer autonom sein, andererseits sind sie sexuell abhängig von Frauen.""

Viele Männer seien so in einer psychologisch vertrackten Situation.

Bei dem Männlichkeitsbild unserer Gesellschaft spiele Macht noch immer eine große Rolle. ""Die Botschaft lautet: Ich brauche Frischfleisch in Serie, weil ich so potent bin und das allen zeigen will"", sagte Pohl.

""Sie drücken damit aus, dass sie Frauen brauchen. Um das zu überspielen, machen die Männer Frauen zum Objekt und lassen sie das auch spüren: in Form von Anmache, Grapschen, bis zur Vergewaltigung.""

Frauenfeindliche Strukturen

Die Folge: ""Diese Männer machen Frauen dafür verantwortlich, dass sie ihr Begehren ausgelöst haben, dass sie von ihnen abhängig sind.""

Dieses Dilemma, so erklärt der Psychologe, sei eine der wichtigen Ursachen von Gewalt gegenüber Frauen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass die Gesellschaft in Deutschland nach wie vor frauenfeindlich sei.

""Wir leben in einer Gesellschaft mit männlicher Vorherrschaft, Frauenfeindlichkeit ist eine Folge davon"", sagte er dem ""Stern"". Daran änderten auch eine Bundeskanzlerin oder einzelne Frauen in Führungspositionen nichts.

Tatsächlich: Zwölf Jahre Merkel-Kanzlerschaft haben so gut wie nichts an der Gleichstellung der Frauen in Deutschland verändert, das zeigen ernüchternde Zahlen.

Bei den Gehältern von Frauen schneidet Deutschland im internationalen Vergleich bemerkenswert schlecht ab. Im Schnitt verdienen weibliche Angestellte immer noch 21 Prozent weniger als Männer in derselben Position. Im OECD-Durchschnitt liegt der Gender-Pay-Gap bei knapp 17 Prozent. Grund dafür ist auch, dass überdurchschnittlich viele Frauen in Deutschland in Teilzeit arbeiten.

""Wir sind bei der Gleichberechtigung noch nicht so weit, wie wir glauben""

In den Vorständen der börsennotierten Unternehmen in Deutschland liegt der Anteil der Männer laut einer Studie der Allbright Stiftung bei 93 Prozent. Auch im Mittelstand herrscht bei den Führungskräften eklatanter Frauenmangel. Nur vier Prozent der Chefs dort sind weiblich.

Für Pohl gibt es zwischen diesen Zahlen und dem Sexismus-Problem einen direkten Zusammenhang. Diskriminierung von Frauen sei nicht, wie es oft heißt, ein Relikt aus vergangener Zeit, das einige wenige alte Männer betreffe.

""Sexuelle Belästigung hat eben nichts Archaisches, sondern findet überall statt, wo Führungsebenen männlich dominiert sind"", sagte der Psychologe. ""Wir sind bei der Gleichberechtigung noch nicht so weit, wie wir glauben.""

Other claims that Premier Notley made about this draft are false.
Catholic sexual morality upholds the dignity, value, and eternal importance of every individual and the sanctity and specialness of their sexuality.
Despite the lies you may be hearing, Premier Notley, it's nothing to be afraid of.","I'm really, really tired of hearing people lie about Catholic education.

For example, I've already heard several people say that the draft letter expressing the Catholic approach to teaching sexual education asserts that consent is not necessary in sexual relations. Even Premier Notley got in on the act, denouncing it as a ""curriculum that normalizes an absence of consent.""

Most of the people making this claim probably didn't read this document. Instead, they simply trusted people like Paula Simons, whose column quoted the line: ""...we guard against a reductionist view of our human sexuality that consent is the most important factor in decision making."" Simons coyly called this ""problematic"" without explaining why, and, without telling her readers the context of this line, the implication became obvious: The Catholic schools will teach that you don't need to consent to sex!

In moral theology, we might call this a grave sin of omission. In colloquial terms, we would call it deceptive and mendacious.

The draft is explicit that ""consent is always necessary for any sexual activity to be healthy."" To use Simons' language: Nothing about this should shock anyone who knows anything about Catholic teachings. Catholicism is well-known for teaching that sexual intercourse is only acceptable within the bounds of marriage, and one of the criteria for a valid marriage is the informed and rational consent of both parties, which is why the Church does not recognize shotgun or otherwise non-consensual marriage. (Paragraphs 1625-1632 of the Catholic Catechism are dedicated to ""matrimonial consent,"" if you're interested.) Even sexual acts within marriage must be free and consensual in order to be ""properly marital,"" otherwise they are also sinful and forbidden.

Catholic sexual morality upholds the dignity, value, and eternal importance of every individual and the sanctity and specialness of their sexuality.

In other words, if Premier Notley wants a sex-ed curriculum that makes consent essential for sex, she should be a big fan of the Catholic one. There is a lot more protection of consent in our view than in the one that allows for ""consensual"" sex that occurs amidst drunken impulsiveness at singles' bars.

What the draft says is that consent is necessary, but insufficient. In other words, two people can consent to an act that is demeaning to them or diminishes their human dignity. In addition to consent, we also need to retain a respect for persons in their humanity.

If this is difficult to understand, consider an economic analogy. Pope Leo XIII, writing on the injustices of the economy, said that just because an employer and an employee freely agree on what the employee's wages should be, that doesn't morally justify those wages. A worker may consent to be paid less than he deserves, and that unjust wage is still unjust. Leo even says that the ""consensual nature"" of the arrangement is insufficient to justify it. The NDP seems to agree, since it believes in raising the minimum wage; apparently, they agree that a ""consensual"" arrangement can still be objectively unjust.

This is the point of the letter, which says that ""sexual relationships are not based solely [emphasis added] upon ongoing consent and pleasure, but rather the understanding that they are to occur in an authentic life-giving relationship.""

Other claims that Premier Notley made about this draft are false. She accuses it of ""refus[ing] to talk about contraception,"" when the text is frank that ""we would be able to teach/educate about different forms of contraceptives in detail"" even if we ""cannot promote"" them. She also asserts that it ""marginalizes sexual minorities"" by upholding the Catholic teaching on homosexuality. Henri Nouwen, one of Hillary Clinton's favourite authors, was a gay Catholic who chose celibacy because of the Church's teachings; if you think that homosexual persons are diminished by this teaching, then you marginalize celibates with homosexual inclinations, a group that is already pretty marginalized.

But what is especially interesting is that, a few days ago, Premier Notley expressed outrage at Quebec's ""religious neutrality"" bill banning Islamic face coverings for women. But a curriculum which compels Catholics to teach a system of sexual morality different than the Church's is at least as much of a government interference in religious liberty.

The premier's own father, Grant Notley, a great proponent of the public schools, was (according to page 163 of his biography) ""opposed to allowing private schools to control their curriculum, except as it came to religious instruction."" Mr. Notley had much the same priorities as his daughter, but he understood the importance of respect religious schools' right to effectively teach in accordance with their convictions.

Catholic sexual morality upholds the dignity, value, and eternal importance of every individual and the sanctity and specialness of their sexuality. Despite the lies you may be hearing, Premier Notley, it's nothing to be afraid of.

Aceptar que Corea del Norte sea un país nuclear no va a hacer que el mundo sea más peligroso.
Para Corea del Sur y Japón, una Corea del Norte nuclear implica un desequilibrio militar a favor de los norcoreanos.
No cabe duda de que aceptar que Corea del Norte sea libremente nuclear va a provocar serias repercusiones a nivel internacional con respecto al Tratado de No Proliferación Nuclear.
Otros países, como Irán y Arabia Saudí, están siguiendo de cerca hasta dónde decide llegar Corea del Norte, quizás para tomar ejemplo.","Hasta el momento, Corea del Norte ya ha llevado a cabo su sexto ensayo nuclear con éxito, además de otros ensayos con misiles balísticos intercontinentales. Llegados a este punto, se puede considerar que cuenta con las herramientas necesarias para poner sobre la mesa ante Estados Unidos su fuerza nuclear disuasiva: ""La teoría de que un país X no lanzará sus bombas contra el país Y si el país Y tiene bombas con las que contraatacar"".

En consecuencia, la ventana de oportunidades de forzar a Corea del Norte a abandonar su programa de armas nucleares se ha cerrado. Aunque Estados Unidos quizás debería negarse a aceptar que Corea del Norte pase a ser un ""estado nuclear legítimo"", no puede seguir ignorando el hecho de que existe una nueva potencia nuclear en el mundo.

La cruda realidad es que Estados Unidos no tiene más opción que aceptar que Corea del Norte sea nuclear si de verdad quiere alcanzar una paz duradera y la estabilidad en la península de Corea. Pero antes de que pueda suceder y aliviar las tensiones, debe cambiar su mentalidad asumiendo que no queda otra que dejar que Corea del Norte se nuclearice. Esto es lo que debe aceptar:

1. Ya es demasiado tarde para desnuclearizar Corea del Norte sin recurrir a la fuerza.

Los países que tomaron la decisión voluntaria de abandonar su programa de armas nucleares, como Sudáfrica, Kazajistán, Ucrania y Bielorrusia, probablemente lo hicieron porque su clima de seguridad mejoró. El caso de Corea del Norte es completamente distinto.

Si ha desarrollado armas nucleares ha sido en parte para disuadir a Estados Unidos de atacarles. El despliegue de tropas y armas estadounidenses en Corea del Sur y Japón, las reiteradas maniobras militares en zonas cercanas a la península de Corea y el poder de Estados Unidos, con el que pocos pueden rivalizar, han conseguido que Corea del Norte se muestre tan paranoica como para protegerse con armas nucleares.

Mientras siga siendo imposible alcanzar una verdadera reconciliación entre ambos países, algo que parece cada vez más improbable si tenemos en cuenta los ásperos discursos de uno y otro lado, Corea del Norte se sentirá amenazada. Por lo tanto, es complicado imaginar que en Pyongyang estén muy dispuestos a abandonar su programa de armas nucleares, y más si el clima de seguridad no deja de agravarse conforme su líder, Kim Jong Un, se sigue enzarzando en una guerra dialéctica con el presidente Donald Trump.

A este paso, solo una ofensiva militar podría privar a Corea del Norte de sus armas nucleares, e incluso esa es una opción poco aconsejable: una medida de tales dimensiones sería costosa y con total probabilidad provocaría una cantidad masiva de víctimas.

2. Aceptar que Corea del Norte sea un país nuclear no va a hacer que el mundo sea más peligroso.

Los líderes norcoreanos son tan racionales como su contraparte estadounidense. El argumento de que Corea del Norte no puede estar incluida en la ""teoría clásica de la disuasión nuclear"" está basado principalmente en el comportamiento agresivo y la naturaleza autoritaria del régimen. Sin embargo, la historia ha demostrado que a los norcoreanos se les ha dado bien medirse y contenerse cuando han considerado que la supervivencia del régimen estaba en juego.

La propia estructura del gobierno no afecta a su racionalidad. La Unión Soviética y China también eran regímenes autoritarios cuando se nuclearizaron, y ambos países fueron considerados pese a todo racionales en el ámbito nuclear. No hay pruebas concretas, tal y como han manifestado altos cargos de la CIA, de que Kim Jong Un sea un ""loco"" capaz de desatar sus armas nucleares sin estar su régimen en peligro.

3. Llegados a este punto, no hay mejores alternativas.

Incluso aunque fueran ciertas las afirmaciones de que Kim Jong Un ""es una persona irracional"", al mundo se le han acabado las opciones de detener su programa nuclear. Las sanciones no sirven para nada. Tras nueve rondas de sanciones impuestas por el Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, Corea del Norte no ha variado su hoja de ruta.

Aunque las sanciones fueran tan severas como para amenazar la subsistencia del país, no hay que perder de vista la tenacidad del pueblo norcoreano para ​resistir las dificultades. La guerra es un riesgo demasiado alto. Si no hubo forma de evitar que Seúl sufriera las represalias del otro lado de la frontera en el pasado (algo que bien podría suceder en el caso de que se desatara el conflicto), tampoco ahora es posible evitarlo.

Una vez comprendidos y asumidos estos puntos, Estados Unidos no debe pensar que una Corea del Norte nuclear supone una derrota ni que deba aceptar de forma ciega todas las exigencias de Pyongyang por el mero hecho de que estos posean armas nucleares. No estoy diciendo que no se pueda hacer nada aparte de apaciguar a Corea del Norte.

Al contrario, se pueden adoptar muchas medidas para mitigar esta crisis y construir una paz duradera en esta región y más allá. A continuación expongo cuatro medidas que podría adoptar Estados Unidos para favorecer un clima más tranquilo en un mundo con una Corea del Norte nuclear.

Donald Trump y Kim Jong Un. El presidente estadounidense aseguró el 1 de octubre de 2017 que negociar con Corea del Norte sobre su programa nuclear sería una pérdida de tiempo, pese a que el secretario de Estado, Rex Tillerson, reveló horas después que los funcionarios estadounidenses tenían canales de comunicación con Pyongyang y que estaban en contacto con ellos. Trump volvió a desmarcarse en Twitter reiterando que las conversaciones serían inútiles.

4. Estados Unidos debe garantizar a sus aliados asiáticos que mantendrá su apoyo en los momentos más complicados.

Para Corea del Sur y Japón, una Corea del Norte nuclear implica un desequilibrio militar a favor de los norcoreanos. Sin embargo, la balanza puede reequilibrarse si Estados Unidos les ofrece unas garantías de seguridad firmes en la región.

Para que la disuasión sea efectiva, Estados Unidos debe avisar explícitamente a Corea del Norte de que está preparado para proteger a sus aliados, aunque cuenten con cabezas nucleares capaces de alcanzar territorio estadounidense.

5. Estados Unidos debe calmar las preocupaciones de Corea del Norte en materia de seguridad.

Hay muchas cosas que se pueden hacer para aliviar las tensiones. Además de garantizar su protección a los aliados, Estados Unidos puede reducir su actividad militar en la región como gesto de buena fe hacia Corea del Norte. Más concretamente, debería ser el jefe de Estado, Donald Trump, quien tendría que llevar la iniciativa de detener su guerra dialéctica con Kim Jong Un.

Es peligroso enzarzarse en una discusión interminable de descalificaciones y humillaciones como ""pequeño hombre cohete"" y ""viejo chocho trastornado"", ya que un enojo podría llevar a cualquiera de los dos líderes a tomar una decisión irracional.

En lugar de centrarse en la desnuclearización, Estados Unidos podría considerar la opción de reducir las sanciones impuestas a Corea del Norte a cambio de concesiones como que los norcoreanos suspendan los ensayos nucleares, una propuesta no muy diferente de la que China formuló hace un tiempo.

6. Estados Unidos y sus aliados deberían dejar que China y Rusia participaran en las negociaciones con Corea del Norte.

Aparte de estrechar vínculos de seguridad con Corea del Sur y Japón, deben aprender la lección que les ha dejado el controvertido sistema de misiles de defensa desplegado en Corea del Sur y tener en cuenta también las preocupaciones e intereses de China y Rusia, como hizo el P5+1 (las cinco potencias mundiales permanentes en el Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas más Alemania) en las negociaciones con Irán.

7. Estados Unidos debe dejar claro que no va a permitir que otras potencias internacionales se nuclearicen.

No cabe duda de que aceptar que Corea del Norte sea libremente nuclear va a provocar serias repercusiones a nivel internacional con respecto al Tratado de No Proliferación Nuclear. Otros países, como Irán y Arabia Saudí, están siguiendo de cerca hasta dónde decide llegar Corea del Norte, quizás para tomar ejemplo.

Estados Unidos, apoyado por otros países, debería dejar claro que cualquier tentativa futura de nuclearización será abordado con severidad, con las graves consecuencias que les provocaría un aislamiento conjunto, sanciones coordinadas e incluso incursiones militares dirigidas desde Naciones Unidas.

We know that he had made threatening texts.” Kelley, wearing black tactical gear and a ballistic vest, stormed First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs during prayer service on Sunday around 11:30 a.m. and opened fire on churchgoers with what Martin described as a “Ruger AR assault-type rifle.” At least 26 people were killed and 20 others wounded in the attack, according to law enforcement officials. Victims were as young as 18 months, and as old as 77.

The suspected gunman most recently lived in New Braunfels, roughly 30 miles northeast of San Antonio, reported the Texas Department of Public Safety. He previously lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, according to public records. Kelley is a former member of the U.S. Air Force who served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, according to USAF spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. The Air Force said late Sunday that Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and their child. He received a bad conduct discharge, a 12-month sentence in a military prison and a reduction in rank for the offense. That same year he was reportedly sued for divorce in New Mexico, The New York Times reported. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals in August 2014 while living in an RV park in Colorado Springs, reported The New York Times. A former neighbor told the Times that someone called the police to report that Kelley struck his pit bull puppy in the head. The case was later dismissed. Abbott on Monday called Kelley “a powder keg waiting to go off” and said state law should have prevented him from buying a gun. “I don’t think this church was picked out at random,” Abbott (R) said during an appearance on “CBS This Morning” on Monday. “I think there was purpose and intent that Devin Kelley had in showing up at this location.” “Current law should have prevented him from being able to get a gun,” he said.

In the past week, we’ve watched (and rewatched) all of the latest installments which means there’s only one thing left to do. Yup, it’s time to start thinking about what might happen in the third series.

Creators the Duffer Brothers have already confirmed that it’s coming, so here are all the questions that will need answering... Will we see Eleven’s sister again? Episode seven, ‘The Lost Sister’, didn’t quite fit in with the rest of the series. While the writers needed to take Eleven out of Hawkins so that she could return and, ultimately, save everyone in the end, this episode-long shift of focus felt a little clunky. Given how divise the episode has been, we wouldn’t be too shocked if the Duffer Brothers just pretended this whole thing hadn’t happened. But as Eleven’s sister, Kali, remains somewhere out there with her group of bandits and misfits, it has cleared a path for potential future storylines.

Netflix

And what about the other children used by the lab? Eleven is (obviously…) number 11 and Kali was branded ‘008’, so - assuming the scientists worked in numerical order - there are potentially at least nine other children that they experimented on. Are they still alive? And if so, will Eleven use her powers to find them, as she did her ‘sister’? Could Eleven’s mother ever be saved? It was heartbreaking to watch Millie Bobby-Brown’s character discover the truth about what happened to her mum, finding her suffering from mental and physical health issues after receiving electro-shock treatment from the lab, in order to make her forget about her daughter. She remains at her home, which begs the question of whether there’s any way she could be saved? Surely Eleven wouldn’t be able to resist visiting her again… #JusticeForBob?

Yeah, he made a lot Dad jokes, called his car “the Bobmobile” and listened to too much Kenny Rogers, but in the end, we really grew to love Sean Astin’s character. If he’s good enough for Joyce Byers, he’s good enough for us - and let’s not forget that Bob played a pretty pivotal role in figuring out where Chief Hopper was when he got lost in the Upside Down, before then coming to the rescue again when the demodogs took over the lab. Quite frankly, to call him ‘the new Barb’ would probably be an undersell, but just as fans of Nancy’s best pal demanded justice for her after season one, we’re hoping for some sort of event to commemorate for Bob’s untimely demise. At least name the Radio Shack after him. What about the two romance storylines? Lucas Sinclair and Mike Wheeler both had their first kisses, with newbie Max Hargrove and Eleven respectively, during the finale’s Snow Ball dance scene so this will obviously need addressing in future episodes. The Duffer Brothers have confirmed that there’ll be another time skip for the next series though, so it’s unlikely that we’ll get to see the immediate aftermath of the romantic encounters. What’s next for Hopper and Eleven?

Not all of the new relationships in ‘Stranger Things 2’ were romances and the pairing of Hopper and Eleven brought us so much joy, but it was tinged with sadness given that Hopper’s daughter, Sarah, died years ago. Seeing him dote on Eleven and attempt to teach her about the world was heart-breakingly beautiful and when they patched up their differences to close the gate to the Upside Down, we were literally cheering on the sofa. For season three, we’d love to see their bond get even stronger so please guys, no arguing this time. We seriously can’t take it. And Steve and Dustin?

Have one partner lie on their back and get comfortable with pillows to support the head, neck and knees as needed.
If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.
Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips.","How to: This one is best performed on a vulva because the penis doesn’t generally bend to accommodate this type of arrangement, says sexologist and author Jessica O’Reilly of Hot Sex Tips, Tricks, And Licks. 1. One partner lies on their back with their knees bent and feet flat on the mattress. 2. The other partner lies atop also on their back with their crotch in the bottom partner’s face. Top partner can lean back against the lower partner’s bent legs/thighs.

How to: ""Though some people swear by it, many of my clients complain that the traditional 69 position can be frustrating and uncomfortable,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Switch it up a little by lying on your sides facing one another so you can give and receive pleasure simultaneously without having to support one another’s body weight.

How to: 1. One partner lies on their side with their top leg bent. 2. The other partner lies on their side facing into their partner’s crotch with a pillow to prop up their head. 3. The first partner lifts their bent leg over the lower partner to give them easier access.

How to: ""Just because this position is pretty self-explanatory, it doesn’t mean it’s a bore,"" O’Reilly says. The Dog allows your partner to access your hot, pulsing nether-regions from both the front and back, and makes it easy for you to control the pressure and depth. 1. Get down on all fours (hands and knees). 2. Your partner can approach from behind or lie beneath you on their back.

How to: Are you more of a taker or a giver? ""As a lover, it is imperative to know how to play both roles and the Gimme More position encourages you to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Sit on your bum with your back resting against the wall or headboard. 2. Bend your knees and spread your legs open with your feet flat against the floor or mattress. 3. Enjoy the view or ask for a blindfold to heighten your touch, smell and sound sensations.

How to: Giving directions is about more than just spewing orders. ""You can easily communicate your wants, needs and fantasies using your body language alone."" 1. Sit upright in a chair with you legs spread apart. 2. Place a pillow at your feet and guide your kneeling partner's hands and mouth toward your sweet spots.

How to: Feeling lazy, but still want to get it on? Then this is the position for you. ""It not only combines the excitement of a rear-entry approach, but allows you to experience new sensations and play with the vulnerability of being pleasured from behind,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Lie on your stomach with your hips propped up by a pillow. 2. If you’re a screamer and want to stay on good terms with your nosy (and jealous) neighbours, you may also want to put your face in a pillow to muffle some of your more explicit sounds.

How to: ""This position forces you to take a more passive role,"" O’Reilly says. However, you can always get active with some sultry dirty talk while you’re lying there. 1. Lie on your back and spread your legs. Seriously. That’s it!

How to: This position is a slight variation of the Lie Back and Take It. 1. Simply lie on your back with your legs spread open and place a pillow under your hips to prop them up while holding onto your ankles with your hands. Feel free to bend your knees. This will allow easier access to your lower genitals, perineum and bum hole.

How to: Not only is this position sizzling hot in terms of the view for both parties, but it’s great for the “sitter” because s/he can control the amount of pressure, speed and/or penetration depth, O’Reilly says. ""If you like to play with a little dominance and submission, the Sit on My Face position is a sexy way to receive oral sex while maintaining a dominant role."" 1. Have one partner lie on their back and get comfortable with pillows to support the head, neck and knees as needed. 2. Have the other kneel over their head facing up toward the top of their head.

How to: ""Standing up for sex not only varies your body’s interpretations of sexual pleasure, but makes for great opportunities for sex outside of the bedroom,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart while your partner gets on their knees between your legs 2. Don't let those knees buckle!

How to: ""Your bedroom should be a playground for erotic exploration and what playground would be complete without a Swing Set?"" 1. Lie on your back with your legs hanging off the side of the bed. 2. If you’re feeling particularly chivalrous, place a pillow on the floor between your legs to protect your lover’s knees.

How to: Some sexual techniques are just better when you approach them from the side. ""If you’re going down on a woman, it may be easier to play with the grooves of her sensitive labia and if you’re going down on a man, a sideways approach can give your tongue easy access to one of the most sensitive parts of his penis: the frenulum,"" O’Reilly says. 1. Have your partner lie on their back with a pillow propping up their hips. 2. Lie on your stomach at a 90 degree angle and bury your head in their crotch.

How to: If you’re into real estate, then the Reverse Rider has everything you could possibly dream of: a great view, a convenient location with easy-access and top value for your sex play dollar, O’Reilly says. ""The best part about this position is that it maximizes pleasure for both of you to promote dual-orgasms."" 1.

""Insomma dovrebbe fare ora, dopo il 5 novembre, quello che non ha fatto dopo il 4 dicembre dell'anno scorso"", la sconfitta al referendum costituzionale.
Analisi della sconfitta e del nuovo fronte di attacco al Pd di Matteo Renzi.","La coalizione di centrosinistra per le politiche va in frantumi già sugli exit poll per le regionali in Sicilia. Ieri sera, ben prima delle prime proiezioni con i dati reali dello spoglio iniziato stamattina, a Pietro Grasso sono cadute le braccia quando si è visto catapultato dal Pd sul banco degli imputati per la sconfitta in Sicilia. ""Patetica accusa"", replica oggi il presidente del Senato, confermando la scelta di stare ormai fuori dal partito. ""Su queste premesse non c'è dialogo col Nazareno"", dice all'Huffpost Alfredo D'Attorre di Mdp, partito che domani riunisce la direzione nazionale a Roma, con Bersani, D'Alema e tutto il gruppo dirigente.

Pd e Mdp restano separati, a contendersi terzo e quarto posto in classifica dopo centrodestra e M5s, se si vuole proiettare il dato siciliano sul nazionale: un'ombra che oggi oscura le analisi di entrambi i partiti.

""Imputare a Grasso il risultato che si va profilando per il Pd, peraltro in linea con tutte le ultime competizioni amministrative e referendarie, è una patetica scusa, utile solo ad impedire altre e più approfondite riflessioni, di carattere politico e non personalistico, in merito al bilancio della fase attuale e alle prospettive di quelle future"", si legge in una nota del portavoce del presidente del Senato.

Grasso ricorda ancora quelle settimane tra maggio e giugno quando dal Nazareno si lasciava filtrare – a mezzo di retroscena di stampa – l'idea di Renzi di candidarlo a governatore della Sicilia. Erano i tempi in cui il Pd provò ad approvare il 'Tedeschellum', i tempi in cui il segretario accarezzava l'idea di un voto anticipato a settembre, cosa che avrebbe agevolato le dimissioni anzitempo della seconda carica dello Stato. Già allora Grasso non gradì. Oggi gradisce ancora meno. ""Sullo stile e l'eleganza dei commenti di alcuni importanti esponenti del Partito Democratico in merito al coraggio del presidente Grasso non resta che confermare ancor di più le motivazioni per le quali il presidente si è dimesso dal gruppo del Pd: merito, metodi e contenuti dell'attuale classe dirigente del partito sono molto lontani da quelli dimostrati dal presidente in tutta la sua opera a servizio dello Stato e delle Istituzioni"", recita ancora la nota.

Stracci. Le regionali in Sicilia seppelliscono - per ora – ogni ipotesi di dialogo tra il Pd di Renzi e quanto c'è alla sua sinistra. Il nuovo caso che si è aperto su Grasso - leader di riferimento nazionale per Mdp anche se ufficialmente non ha ancora deciso - è solo la punta dell'iceberg di una nuova ondata di tensione e scambi di accuse tra sconfitti. Perché se il candidato del Pd Fabrizio Micari perde la sfida e si perde per strada anche tanti voti Dem - andati al M5s di Giancarlo Cancelleri e anche al vincente Nello Musumeci del centrodestra - pure la performance del candidato di Mdp Claudio Fava non brilla. Non si vede l'effetto novità della nascita di una forza politica nuova, lanciata dagli ex Dem anti-renziani.

Insomma: due sconfitte non fanno una coalizione, nemmeno nelle premesse.

""Con Fava siamo riusciti a tenere aperta un'alternativa"", ci dice Alfredo D'Attorre di Mdp. ""Abbiamo provato a chiedere dei segnali sul Rosatellum, abbiamo detto che così si aiutava la destra. Il Rosatellum è stato approvato e ora, dopo le regionali in Sicilia, con una destra così in rimonta, è tutto più difficile. E' chiaro che non può esserci dialogo se il Pd continua a rivendicare Jobs Act e Buona scuola. Renzi dovrebbe prendere atto del fatto che quella linea politica ha portato a perdere voti, dovrebbe ascoltare e mettere in atto una nuova priorità programmatica"", continua. ""Insomma dovrebbe fare ora, dopo il 5 novembre, quello che non ha fatto dopo il 4 dicembre dell'anno scorso"", la sconfitta al referendum costituzionale.

In India, it is estimated that half of Indian women age 15-49 (48 percent) and 43 percent of Indian men age 15-49 are undernourished. Arguably, a third of women of reproductive age in India is undernourished. In children under 5, statistics reveal that stunting is seen in 48 per cent while 43 per cent are underweight and wasting is common in close to 20 per cent. Hence, India is what it eats. It seems either hungry or without sufficiently nutritious food.

While governments ignore or dismiss these statistics, what they often do not realise is that poor nutrition is a leading cause of vulnerability to diseases. Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases. Take the case of Tuberculosis of TB- one of India's top killers.

TB is easily diagnosed and treated, yet it kills lakhs of Indians each year. Several studies globally, and in India, illustrate that social, behavioural, economic and environmental factors like undernutrition, indoor air pollution, smoking and alcohol addiction act as facilitating factors to the spread of TB.

Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases

Of these, undernutrition is the single-most important predisposing factor for TB in India. Hence, a significant section of India's population has poor nutrition and resultantly poor immunity to the TB bacteria. Not surprisingly, like undernutrition, TB exists in India at an epic scale, most often affecting those among the age group of 15-55 — an individual's most productive age.

With undernutrition we essentially create large masses with increased vulnerability to TB and other diseases. This, along with poor infection control and limited awareness, creates disease epidemics such as TB in India. Nutrition also affects recovery from disease. In the case of TB, poor nutrition also affects recovery from TB and increases drug toxicity, relapse and death once TB develops. As a result patients with poor nutritional levels are likely to show poorer performance on TB treatment because of poor muscle strength. There is always a higher risk of TB relapse among such patients as well. Appropriate nutritional intake is critical to ensure treatment completion as well as a faster road to recovery.

When considering India's significant TB crisis, it is clear that new technologies, quick and early diagnosis and less toxic treatments are critical to address India's TB epidemic. With a vast number of people affected, this is needed urgently. An accompanying though more fundamental question, what about addressing hunger and nutrition? How can we comprehensively address TB in the long-term without addressing the nutritional status of the population and ensuring immunity? Until we do so, are we not setting a near-impossible task for ourselves with a large and vulnerable population? Unless we address the root cause, will faster diagnosis and improved treatment alone end TB in India?

India needs food security for increased immunity for all diseases including TB. Why? The answers are simple. First and foremost, hunger and poor nutrition should be morally unacceptable in largely poor countries like India. If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority. Without food, words like vikas are meaningless. Also, continued malnutrition and hunger increase vulnerability, thereby increasing disease prevalence, and consequently human suffering, burdening the health system and society at large. This has staggering human, economic and social consequences that perpetuate inequity—something that should be unacceptable as well. From a purely economic view, it causes increased suffering, loss of wages, unemployment, debt and financial desperation — undesirables in India's fantastic march towards vikas.

If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority

It's time India thought of significant investment in nutrition as the foundational basis of a population's well-being, social justice, economic growth and as a preventive strategy for all diseases. Some solutions that India must consider are universal food security. This, of course, is fraught with challenges both in relation to implementation and in funding. However, these challenges cannot be used as the basis of reneging on this essential and beneficial strategy.

Too often there are too many ineffective schemes.We need to re-examine, link and innovate programmes run by various ministries, including health and women & child development among others. This is possible if we mainstream nutrition and food security for all beneficiary groups and not just those affected by diseases. For those affected by diseases, we need to provide long-term specialised nutritional support and supervision through programmes that ensure sufficient nutrition.

It's time to go back to basics and recognise that nutrition is the fundamental building block not just for disease prevention but the nation itself. Until we do so our claims to eliminate TB or any other disease will remain hollow. And our march towards vikas will be like a never-ending one to a mythical heaven.

Ist man aber von Beruf Erzieherin, rate ich dringend davon ab.

So findet man nämlich dort Posts, in denen eine Mutter von ihrem erschütterten Vertrauen zu der Erzieherin ihres Sohnes berichtet, weil diese ihn im KiGa beim Essen für 2 Minuten vor die Tür gesetzt hat, da er sich dort angefangen hatte zu prügeln.

Das Kind wäre jetzt emotional total am Boden... Musste das Zimmer verlassen, bis die Erzieherin nach kam, um die Situation mit dem Kind in Ruhe zu klären. Sie fühle sich überhaupt nicht mehr wohl jetzt dort.

Muss man hier schon etwas schmunzeln, so liest man am besten nicht weiter, was andere Mütter darunter schreiben:

""Das ist verletzte Aufsichtspflicht! Dafür kannst du sie kündigen lassen!""

""Melde das dem Träger.""

""Erkundige dich beim Rechtsanwalt.""

""Vielleicht kann man den KiGa deshalb schließen lassen, frag mal bei Jugendamt nach.""

Ungelogen.

Alltag im Kindergarten

Ich habe mir also ein Herz gefasst und versucht zu erklären, wie eine Essenssituation im KiGa abläuft:

20 Kinder sitzen um einen Tisch und warten darauf, dass du jedem von Ihnen das Essen austeilst. Nebenbei rufen die ersten schon wieder nach was zu trinken, weil ihr Glas schon ausgetrunken ist. Ein kleineres Kind braucht Hilfe dabei, sein Fleisch zu schneiden.

Ein weiteres jammert darüber, dass ihm das Essen nicht schmeckt. Der Nebenmann schmeißt das Glas um, die Pfütze muss aufgewischt werden. Wieder leere Trinkgläser. Zwei Kinder streiten, weil einer eine Nudel vom Teller des anderen geklaut hat und die zwei daneben bewerfen sich giggelnd mit ihrem Essen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir Erzieher stehen jeden Tag kurz vor dem Burnout

So... Ist es da nicht vielleicht gar nicht soooooo unverständlich, dass das Kind kurz draußen warten soll, bis alle versorgt sind, damit die Erzieherin dann in Ruhe mit ihm sprechen kann um die Situation zu klären? Vor allem, wenn die Gruppentüre ein Glasfenster hat, um sehen zu können, was draußen vor sich geht?

Ich habe für diese Darstellung viele ""Likes"" bekommen, hauptsächlich von anderen Erzieherinnen. Von den anderen wurde meine Sicht der Dinge ignoriert. Ganz klar, sonst kann man sich ja nicht weiter aufregen.

Keine Ahnung von den Aufgaben der Erzieher

Nun könnte man meinen, dieses Phänomen tritt nur im Internet auf. Aber nein.

Zurück in der Arbeitswelt, kann ich nur noch Kopfschütteln. Und es wird mit jedem Jahr nur schlimmer... KiGa-Bashing, das neue Hobby vieler Eltern. Eine ganz neue Art des Mobbing ist geboren.

Als Erzieher ist es heutzutage kaum mehr möglich, sich auf die Bedürfnisse der Kinder zu konzentrieren, da einige Eltern ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse beim Personal an erster Stelle sehen.

Es ist nicht mehr möglich, überhaupt irgendetwas richtig zu machen, deshalb verbringt man gefühlte Stunden damit, sich morgens oder mittags vor Eltern im Flur zu rechtfertigen, warum dieses oder jenes so passiert ist.

So kommt zum Beispiel eine Mutter mit der Beschwerde, man habe ihr am Vortag nicht gesagt, dass ihr Kind im Flur beim Anziehen Streit angefangen habe. Sie möchte so etwas aber bitte dringend immer sofort mitgeteilt bekommen, denn schließlich möchte sie dann mit ihrem Kind darüber reden können, dass man so etwas nicht tut.

Ok... das ist jetzt zum Beispiel eine der Aufgaben, die ein Erzieher eigentlich hat: Hilfe bei der Konfliktlösung. Vielleicht habe das aber auch bloß ich falsch verstanden.

Jedenfalls wird bei dieser Beschwerde und gleichzeitigen Bitte anscheinend übersehen, dass wir nicht nur ein Kind betreuen. Und bei einer Gruppe von 20 Kindern würde es ziemlich viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen, jeder Mutter beim Abholen einen Bericht darüber zu erstatten, wann ihr Kind sich gestritten hat. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: Kinder streiten ständig!

Auch kommt es manchmal vor, dass ein Kind dabei ausholt, und dem andern Kind ""eine scheppert"". Natürlich greifen wir Erzieher dann ein (selten schaffen wir das, bevor es ""klatsch"" gemacht hat, wir sind Menschen, keine Fantasyfiguren mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit), erklären, dass man dem andern nicht weh tun darf und zeigen alternative Handlungsmöglichkeiten auf.

Wir überprüfen, ob sich der andere weh getan hat, reichen Kühlbeutel und Kügelchen.

Beim Abholen werden Eltern von ""Täter"" und ""Opfer"" informiert, damit sie Bescheid wissen, falls Ihre Kinder daheim davon erzählen. Passt, oder? Nein, passt nicht.

Drohungen und Beleidigungen gegen das Personal

Greift ein Kind noch zwei mal öfter darauf zurück, sich körperlich zu wehren oder zu äußern, gibt es schon nach kürzester Zeit die lautstarke Forderung von Eltern, dieses Kind dem Jugendamt zu melden.

Es wird von einer Gefahrenlage im Kindergarten gesprochen. Ja, es wird sogar der Kindergarten gewechselt. Weil das ja sonst nirgends vorkommt oder toleriert wird! Nur hier ist das so.

Dass es sich hierbei um Kinder handelt, die zwei Minuten nach ihrem Streit wieder miteinander spielen und keiner dabei verletzt wurde, vergessen die Eltern hierbei leider komplett.

Natürlich gibt es auch Kinder, die tatsächlich Bedürfnisse haben, die ihr derzeitiger Kindergarten nicht erfüllen kann. Je nachdem worum es dabei geht, und vor allem, wenn so viel ""körperliches Verhalten"" im Spiel ist, kann man den Eltern dann also höflich ans Herz legen, dass heilpädagogisch geschultes Personal ihrem Kind besser dabei helfen kann, seine Konflikte zu bewältigen.

Dabei lässt man dann ganz bewusst weg, dass ihr Kind nicht aufgrund von Hochbegabung ""unterfordert"" ist, wie von den Eltern geschildert, sondern das Problem wo anders liegt.

Wenn's so einfach denn wäre... Nein.

""Was für ein unfähiges Personal kommt jetzt nicht mit meinem Kind zurecht? Dieser Kindergarten ist das Allerletzte! Andere müssen vor euch gewarnt werden!""

Wenn man dann als privater Kindergarten auch noch das Recht hat, den Betreuungsvertrag zu kündigen, weil man mit den Eltern zusammen im Gespräch nicht weiter kommt und sich angemessene Hilfe für das Kind wünscht (und andere Eltern berechtigterweise schon mit dem Jugendamt drohen) erreicht der Frust dieser Eltern ganz neue Dimensionen.

Drohungen, den Kindergarten bei der Familienministerin zu melden. Beim Landesjugendamt über das unfähige Personal informieren wollen.

Ja, solche Drohungen gehören mittlerweile zum Alltag eines Erziehers.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Die Eltern werden dir die Hölle heiß machen"" - das habe ich in 40 Jahren als Erzieherin gelernt

Erzieher sollen sich aber ganz selbstverständlich beißen lassen, wenn man versucht, das Kind zu beruhigen. Immerhin sind wir ja selber schuld, unfähig wie wir sind.

Organisierte Elternbanden

Man könnte jetzt sagen: Ok, vielleicht ist das ein Problem der privaten Einrichtungen. Aber nein! Die Kollegin aus dem Regelkindergarten erzählt, dass sie einen Papa im Garten neulich fragte, warum er mit seinem Handy Fotos der dort zum Spielen vorhandenen Fahrräder macht.

Sie wurde dann darüber aufgeklärt, dass sein Kind sich an einem Fahrrad in den Finger geschnitten hat. Drei Tage später kam ein Brief vom Rechtsanwalt der gegen den Kindergarten klagt, weil bei einem Fahrrad am Lenker der Gummigriff fehlte und sich das Kind dort verletzt habe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eltern: Hört auf, eure Kinder zu verweichlichten Menschen zu erziehen

Oder aber organisierte Elternbanden, die sich beim Bürgermeister beschweren, weil der Kindergarten sich pädagogisch begründet weigert, das Vorschulprogramm nach den Vorstellungen einzelner Eltern für alle zu erweitern.

Wenn ich also morgens aufstehe und mich für die Arbeit fertig mache denke ich mir nicht: Oh ja, heute backe ich Kuchen mit den Kids! Sondern: Mal sehen, was mich heute wieder davon abhält, Kuchen mit den Kids zu backen.

Die traurige Wahrheit ist: Die ganze Zeit, die wir damit verbringen, uns mit solchen Dingen herumzuschlagen, verbringen wir eben nicht bei den Kindern.

Aber liebe Eltern, was glaubt ihr denn, wem ihr hier eure Kinder anvertraut? Sind wir auf das viele Geld aus, dass man als Erzieher verdient? Bekommt man einen Erzieherabschluss durchs Beantworten von Multiple-Choice-Fragen im Internet?

Wir wollen für eure Kinder da sein

Erzieher sind Menschen, die es sich zum Beruf gemacht haben, für eure Kinder da zu sein. Wir wollen sie umsorgen, ihnen etwas beibringen und ihnen einen geborgenen Raum für ihre Entwicklung schaffen.

Die ganze Negativität, die tagtäglich über das ""Nichts-recht-machen-können"" in unseren Gruppenalltag eindringt, verstört Kinder und Personal.

Wir opfern unsere Freizeit, um Spielzeug für Eure Kinder zu basteln, um Feste vorzubereiten und um uns Beschäftigungen mit Lerneffekt auszudenken.

Die geopferte Freizeit wird aber mit jedem mal Drama etwas weniger. Denn ganz ehrlich: Wer hat schon Lust, sich unbezahlt Gedanken über die Arbeit zu machen, wenn man als Dank dafür schlecht gemacht wird und sich beleidigen lassen muss?

Liebe besagte Eltern, seht ihr nicht, dass ihr höchstpersönlich dafür sorgt, dass die Qualität schlechter und die Geduld weniger wird, die wir gerne für eure Kinder übrig hätten?

Jedem, der sich in diesen Beispielen mit ähnlichem Verhalten wiedererkennt, möchte ich sagen:

Ihr seid die Tyrannen, die ihren Anteil am Personalnotstand der Kindergärten haben.

Wer möchte schon freiwillig unter solchen Umständen arbeiten?!

Es gibt sie noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern

Abschließend möchte ich aber dringend betonen: Es gibt sie natürlich noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern!

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens nicht aufstehe, um mir zu überlegen, wie ich sie ärgern kann oder ihr Kind negativ in seiner Entwicklung beeinflussen kann.

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens aufstehe, weil ich ihre Kinder liebe, und nur das Beste für die mir anvertrauten kleinen Menschen will.

Die Eltern, die ""Danke"" sagen.

Die Eltern, die mir nicht sofort böse Absicht unterstellen, wenn tatsächlich mal ein Fehler passiert.

Die Eltern, die zu vernünftigen Gesprächen bereit sind, wenn es ein Problem gibt.

Bitte, liebe ""normale"" Eltern! Ihr müsst endlich lauter sein als die Dauer-Motzer und Drama-Verursacher! Damit wir weiterhin wissen, warum wir morgens aufstehen und nicht irgendwann resignieren.

Dabei ist ein Abfangversuch äußerst riskant

Trump will sich bei seiner Asienreise außerdem mit dem russischen Präsidenten Putin treffen

US-Präsident Donald Trump ist zu Beginn seiner fast zweiwöchigen Asienreise in Japan eingetroffen. Einige hundert amerikanische und japanische Soldaten bereiteten ihm am Sonntagvormittag (Ortszeit) auf dem US-Militärstützpunkt Yokota einen begeisterten Empfang.

""Japan ist ein geschätzter Partner und wichtiger Alliierter, und wir danken ihnen für ihre Freundschaft"", sagte Trump.

Nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur Kyodo soll er jedoch im Vorfeld Unverständnis für Tokios Reaktion auf zwei kürzliche Raketentests durch Nordkorea geäußert haben. Er könne nicht verstehen, warum ein Land von Samurai-Kriegern die Raketen nicht abschoss, soll Trump gesagt haben.

Dabei wäre sowohl ein erfolgreicher als auch ein gescheiterter Abschuss äußerst gefährlich.

""Japan will der Eskalation wohl aus dem Weg gehen""

Der Abfang einer Rakete - gerade einer Interkontinentalrakete - gilt als große Herausforderung. Die USA testeten im Mai 2017 ihr Raketenabwehrsystem ""Ground-based Midcourse Defense"" (GMD) - mit einer Erfolgsquote von 53 Prozent, wie das Pentagon mitteilte.

Das japanische Verteidigungsministerium habe sich nach der Berechnung der Flugroute der nordkoreanischen Raketen dazu entschlossen, keinen Abgangversuch zu starten, berichtet die japanische Tageszeitung ""Japan Times"". Ein Fehlversuch würde Japan blamieren und Nordkorea womöglich zu weiteren Test ermuntern, so die Überlegung.

Ein erfolgreicher Abschuss könnte außerdem die Situation eskalieren lassen. ""Einen Abschuss hätte Nordkorea umgehend als Provokation und Anlass für zeitnahe weitere Raketentests gesehen, dieser Eskalation wollte Japan wohl aus dem Weg gehen"", zitierte der ""Spiegel"" einen ranghohen Bundeswehroffizier nach einem kürzlichen Raketentest der Nordkoreaner.

Trump will sich mit Putin treffen

Der gefährliche Konflikt um das Atomwaffenprogramm in Nordkorea wird eines der zentralen Themen der zweiwöchigen Asien-Reise von Trump sein. Darüber wird er am Montag auch mit dem japanischen Ministerpräsidenten Shinzo Abe in Tokio sprechen.

Seine erste Asienreise wird Trump von Japan aus weiter nach Seoul führen, nach China, Vietnam und auf die Philippinen. Trump erwartet während seiner Reise auch ein Treffen mit seinem russischen Kollegen Wladimir Putin.

""Ich denke, es wird erwartet, dass wir uns mit Putin treffen"", sagte Trump am Sonntag auf der Reise nach Tokio an Bord der Air Force One mitreisenden Reportern. ""Wir wollen, dass Putin mit Nordkorea hilft, und wir werden eine Reihe verschiedener Anführer treffen"", sagte Trump. Die beiden Präsidenten haben sich zuletzt am Rande des G20-Gipfels in Hamburg getroffen.

Ein Treffen Trumps mit Putin am Rande eines Gipfels der Asiatisch-Pazifischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft (Apec) in Da Nang in Vietnam war von russischer Seite bereits ins Spiel gebracht, vom Weißen Haus aber bislang nicht bestätigt worden.

Trump selbst hatte vor der Reise dem Sender Fox News gesagt: ""Das ist eine sehr wichtige Reise. Wir können uns mit Putin treffen."" Eine endgültige Bestätigung eines Treffens steht gleichwohl noch aus.

ATTENTION SPOILERS





Vous êtes bien sûr de vouloir continuer?

Alors c'est parti !

Menacé à bout portant par Morales, Rick nous avait quittés dans une situation bien délicate. Une affaire finalement expédiée sans trop de problèmes par Daryl (Qui imaginait sérieusement la mort de Rick?), auteur d'un magnifique tir à l'arbalète.

""C'était..."" s'exprime alors Rick, sous le choc avant que son coéquipier ne l'interrompe, ""Je sais. J'en ai rien à battre."" Du Daryl dans le texte somme toute.

Dans le même temps, Jesus, Tara et Morgan s'occupent de ramener les Sauveurs survivants à Maggie qui doit décider de leur sort. Un retour marqué par une ""attaque"" de zombies sur le chemin. L'affrontement (comme à son habitude lorsqu'il s'agit des affreuses bêtes) se transforme en une véritable boucherie. C'est le moment choisi par un petit groupe de Sauveurs pour tenter de prendre la fuite dans la forêt.

Morgan les prend en chasse et décide d'en éliminer un avant de se faire rattraper par Jesus. S'ensuit alors un vif échange entre les deux hommes, chacun restant sur ses positions. Morgan se justifie au motif ""qu'ils ont tenté de s'enfuir et qu'ils recommenceront encore et encore"". La discussion se finit en bagarre... entre les deux hommes.

Certains fans pointaient du doigt (parfois à juste titre) le manque d'action de la série. Cet épisode 3 permet de revenir aux fondamentaux de ""The Walking Dead"" avec des scènes d'affrontements, en résulte un ensemble dynamique et vivant. Rick et Daryl, attaqués par les Sauveurs, parviennent à s'en sortir assez remarquablement (on pourra au passage évoquer l'aide notable d'Aaron) pendant que Jesus et Morgan continuent de se battre.

We're walking out of here #TWD pic.twitter.com/q9dENlhYhL — The Walking Dead AMC (@WalkingDead_AMC) 6 novembre 2017

Une altercation de trop pour l'homme au bâton qui décide de plier bagage: ""Je ne peux pas participer à ça"", explique-t-il. Jesus et Tara rejoignent finalement la Colline. Grégory s'y trouve (vous vous souvenez, le traître qui avait rejoint Negan et qui avait pris la voiture du Pèe Gabriel précédemment) grâce à l'indulgence de Maggie. L'ancienne compagne de Glenn est d'ailleurs confrontée au dilemme posé par Jesus: abattre les Sauveurs capturés ou les laisser vivre...

Un choix rencontré également par Daryl et Rick. Après avoir retrouvé Gracie (Nous en avons parlé dans la semaine), les deux hommes sont pris pour cible par un Sauveur qui accepte finalement de leur dévoiler la cache des armes d'assaut tant recherchée par Rick. N'ayant aucune pitié, Daryl se charge ensuite de l'éliminer d'une balle logée en pleine tête (Du grand Daryl dans cet épisode).

Tout semble aller pour le mieux dans ce 3e épisode. Mais évidemment, ""The Walking Dead"" ne se passe jamais comme prévu. La dernière scène voit le groupe d'Ezekiel se faire canarder (on n'y voit pas grand chose mais on se doute que des Sauveurs sont dans le coup) par des mitrailleuses, vraisemblablement celles initialement recherchées par Daryl et Rick.

Les balles pleuvent et plusieurs membres sont tués pour ce qui est sans doute la première (grosse) erreur du roi Ezekiel. Quant à Negan, aucune nouvelle de lui...

""You wouldn't think it was possible, but these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm. I guess that's Australia for you.""

Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behaviour at the University of New England, told The Guardian it was unusual for cockatoos to target cables.

""It would have to be an acquired taste, because it's not their usual style,"" she said.

""Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, they don't usually go for cables. But it might be the colour or the position of the cables that's attracted them.""

The cockatoo-wrought damage comes amid ongoing roll-out problems for the NBN, including poor service and sluggish speeds.

Es könnte ein Paukenschlag sein. Im Fall der Verstrickung des Wahlkampfteams von US-Präsident Donald Trump mit dem Kreml hat die russische Anwältin Natalia Veselnitskaya brisante Informationen veröffentlicht.

So soll Donald Jr. ihr versprochen haben, ein 2012 von der Obama-Regierung eingeführtes Gesetz zurückzunehmen, das russischen Staatsbeamten Sanktionen auferlegt. Das berichtet die Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg mit Verweis auf ein Interview der Anwältin in Moskau.

""Falls wir an die Macht kommen...""

Das Versprechen soll Trump Jr. bei einem viel zitierten Treffen am 9. Juni 2016 in New York geäußert haben. Ebenfalls anwesend: Trumps Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und der damalige Kampagnen-Manager Paul Manafort. Letzterer hatte sich Ende Oktober nach monatelangen Ermittlungen gegen ihn dem FBI gestellt. Manafort wird unter anderem Verschwörung gegen die USA vorgeworfen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schlüsselfigur in der Russland-Affäre: Wer ist George Papadopoulos - und wie gefährlich ist er für Trump?

Nach eigener Aussage reiste Veselnitskaya unter anderem mit dem Ziel nach New York, sich für das Ende der amerikanischen Sanktionen gegen Russland einzusetzen. Darum ging es auch beim Treffen im Trump Tower am 9. Juni. ""Falls wir an die Macht kommen, werden wir uns anschauen, was wir diesbezüglich unternehmen können"", soll Trump Jr. der Anwältin geantwortet haben.

Veselnitskaya ging nach eigener Aussage allerdings nicht im offiziellen Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die Gespräche.

Treffen war Zeitverschwendung

Im Gegenzug wollte der Präsidentensohn Unterlagen, die belegen, dass Hillary Clintons Wahlkampagne veruntreute Gelder bezogen hat. Geldgeber der Demokraten sollen bei den Steuern getrickst haben und diese Gelder an Hillary Clinton gespendet haben. Eine Information, die der britische Publizist Rob Goldstone Trump Jr. zuvor in einer E-Mail übermittelt hatte – im Namen Veselnitskayas.

Mit diesen konnte die Anwältin aber nicht dienen. Trump Jr. bezeichnete das Treffen darum im Nachhinein als Zeitverschwendung.

Veselnitskaya sicherte zu, die brisanten Informationen über das Gespräch auch unter Eid an den US-Sonderermittler Robert Mueller weiterzugeben, wenn es verlangt werde. Damit würde der Druck auf Donald Trump massiv wachsen – eine illegitime Absprache mit der russischen Regierung im Wahlkampf wäre wohl nur noch schwer mehr von der Hand zu weisen.

That's how it goes doesn't it? Well that's how it will be in our house forever more. You see in our house, the third was a momentous occasion not to be sniffed at. Joseph ate a sandwich that did not consist of cheese spread.

Any autism parent will know about the food battles. The monotony of the same food EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Yep, you all know it. The problems it causes when eating out because there is nothing your child will eat and you cannot face the confrontation and succumb to the sensory needs of your child rather than attempting to introduce something new.

Way back in the day before we faced these issues, Joseph ate everything. I can't recall the day it all stopped but over time I have tried a few subtle introductions of old foods. Each time, he has rejected it and in the main, I have accepted it. But a few years ago, I decided that Joseph would eat sandwiches again. I was fed up with taking cracker-bread out and about and decided that there was no reason why he couldn't enjoy bread again. The first time, he wretched a little and I wasn't sure whether I had completely misjudged this. After his initial look of horror, he ate it and we progressed from there. Wholemeal bread, bread-cakes and now he LOVES bread. But only eating sandwiches that consists of cheese spread causes problems because nobody stocks those in a cafe. You can't just order a cheese spread sandwich off the menu and that's always been my end goal, ordering something regular off the menu.

Although I usually plan these changes to the letter, today was completely off the cuff. Parenting failure meant there was no cheese spread and I'd bought a beef paste a few weeks ago with the intention of trying it out.

Yep, you read that right. Beef spread. Tried cheese before and that was a no go. Tried ham and that causes more obscene facial expressions than I can truly describe. I considered that maybe it was the texture of these foods and a spread may be the way to go.

I carefully spread the paste over the bread, taking care not to expose anything to the outer bread (Fuck My Life), in order to fool Joseph completely. Fool Joseph completely? Who the fuck am I trying to kid here? That child can smell a difference a hundred paces off. Despite casually placing the sandwich on the table and walking away, not wanting to make a big deal of it, he knew. Yes he knew. He peeled back the bread and said ""what's this?"" I explained and told me quite assertively ""I'm gonna have cheese spread, not THIS."" I calmly told him there was none left and if he ate it, I would be very pleased and he could eat three small bags of Haribo. Yep, I'm that parent who offers the bribes.

We had a couple of tears but nothing we both couldn't handle. I even offered a couple of crisps (boy am I generous) for each mouthful he had, increasing the number I was offering in exchange for each bite. When he got to six he gave me THE EYE and told me he wasn't going to ten. No flies on that child.

After half an hour, he had finished half of the sandwich. I told him if he ate it all, we could go shopping for a treat (bringing the big guns out now) but he told me he didn't want one, so I called it a day.

That to me was a win and I'll take it.

To all those parents who are horrified I would even attempt such a thing with a child with autism who has sensory difficulties, I know my child and I have not scarred him. If the bread scenario is anything to go by, it'll be his new favourite food.

To those who question whether breaking a routine is possible. It is.

To those who wonder why I would subject my child to beef paste sandwiches. I have no idea and in all honesty, I was on the verge of wretching myself. The whiff of dog meat was the only thing I can compare it to and for that Joseph, I truly apologise.

Next time, we'll try a salmon paste.

The experience of turning 50 is confronting.

The fact of the milestone explains some disconcerting physical changes. Muscles are stiffer in the morning. Golf balls fall short like someone's weighted them. Eyes read blurry.

In truth, these are minor issues and the machine that is the body still manages to deal with the trials of life without too much trouble.

But being defined by a number beginning with a five strikes a blow at one's identity. Claiming youth is now the kind of stretch best left to those of a more limber age. Genuinely young people in their twenties or thirties might talk to you with pity or reverence, but either way the invitation to kick on at the night club later is unlikely to be forthcoming.

Here was the perfect crew to explore what this sad course of events means and how on earth were we going to deal with it.

Never have I struggled so hopelessly to alter a fact of life so stubbornly resolute. I'm 50. I can hide it or not talk about it, but I can't change it.

Of course not all who have recently shared this fate deal with the issue in the same way. There are the Zen-like creatures who claim to have embraced their age, but they are liars.

There are those who enter a deep state of denial. This certainly has its attractions, but no matter how profound my self-deception I still find the truth haunts me in the small hours of the night. Not that 50 year olds are ever awake in the small hours of the night that often any more, of course.

And, there are some who play up in a glorious expression of their mid-life crisis. If I had the flamboyance and disregard for embarrassment to make this work I'd be tempted, but the truth is turning 50 has given me neither.

So, in an attempt to reconcile with Father Time, I went on a trip with old school friends to share the misery with a bottle of wine.

There is something extraordinary about friendships made in teenage years. The shared moment of life's discovery carries with it an honesty about who we really are. Affectations haven't had time to mature. The hopes, fears and dreams of the future lay us bare. Those who knew us then carry throughout life the familiarity of youth. Conversation flows.

Here was the perfect crew to explore what this sad course of events means and how on earth were we going to deal with it.

The content of our discussion did betray the difference in our lives compared with 20-years before. Then it was about life's start as the first kids arrived in the group. The energy and sacrifices required to experience the joy of parenthood were being explored. Our children totally changed our identity, but the exhausting effort meant there was no time to wallow in questions about who we were.

Now, we were talking about life's end. In the past year, three of us had lost our dads. We compared heart-wrenching choices about ageing parents and nursing homes. This clearly predictable side of life had snuck up and mugged us, completely unaware. The idea that our lives would always contain their essential cast of characters had been shattered. Only a few will witness the whole journey.

Even more sadly, thoughts turned to friends and colleagues, people far younger than I, who had already passed. They had been unfairly shortchanged in the experience of life. Through this lens experiencing a 50th birthday really was joyous, and our angst of identity a little indulgent.

Better then to move on to bucket lists and hopes for the future: the familiar discussion we'd been having since childhood.

The dreams ranged from the professional (being on a board of a listed company); to the philanthropic (setting up an NGO for textile workers in the developing world); to developing a new skill (learning to ride dressage); and to the deeply personal -- having the simple courage to change.

We had failed to predict so much of life, good and bad, that we agreed there would be no mid-term review of these dreams. Hopes provide direction and motivation, but life is about how you experience whatever the journey has to offer. Holding to account would be missing the point.

By the night's close there was joy and exuberance in a conversation which took us back to our earliest days. There was also comfort knowing that with these people it was a conversation we could have in the future, again and again.

Age has changed us to be sure. The unsettling nature of 50 still persists. But pain and experience is best handled with company. Through this very special group of peers and childhood friends we have become the witnesses of our lives.

That might just be the comfort I was looking for.",Anyone Who Says They Enjoyed Turning 50 Is A Liar,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/richard-marles/anyone-who-says-they-enjoyed-turning-50-is-a-liar_a_23267555/

La legge elettorale voluta dal Pd e da pochi giorni promulgata dal Presidente della Repubblica Sergio Mattarella penalizzerebbe, e di molto, i democratici. Lo dice una proiezione fatta da Youtrend che, naturalmente, ha utilizzato come base di partenza il voto più recente, quello delle elezioni regionali appena concluse. E il responso è senza appello per il Pd: zero collegi uninominali.

Il Rosatellum è un sistema elettorale misto: proporzionale per il 64%, maggioritario per il 36%. Secondo i dati in via di consolidamento di questa tornata regionale, nei collegi del maggioritario il Pd sarebbe tagliato fuori nell'isola fino ad oggi guidata da Rosario Crocetta. Sembra quindi materializzarsi quel sospetto iniziato a circolare negli ambienti parlamentari dem qualche giorno prima dell'approvazione definitiva della legge elettorale al Senato. Uno studio commissionato dal Pd aveva già messo in guardia i democratici sul rischio di perdere pesantemente nei collegi di alcune regioni. Al Nord, per esempio, come in Veneto e Lombardia, tra le Regioni più pesanti in termini di seggi. Ma anche nel profondo Sud, come in Calabria e in Sicilia.

Nei collegi uninominali la sfida è tra i singoli candidati e ad aggiudicarsi il seggio è colui che prende un voto in più del suo avversario. La Sicilia, peraltro, è terra ostica per la sinistra da vent'anni a questa parte (il Pd è il partito uscente di governo ma la sua vittoria alle elezioni del 2012 fu certamente favorita dalle divisioni del centrodestra - con Musumeci e Micciché avversari e oggi alleati - e da un M5S più debole di oggi). Basti ricordare che in Sicilia si registrò il famoso 61 a 0 del centrodestra nei collegi uninominali alle elezioni politiche del 2001: allora si votò con il Mattarellum che si basava su dei collegi più piccoli rispetto a quelli che dovranno essere ridefiniti dal Governo per l'applicazione del Rosatellum. Saranno tra i 20 e i 22 e in nessuno di questi il centrosinistra riuscirebbe a vincere il seggio. Mentre punta all'en plein il centrodestra, come ha fatto intendere lo stesso Micciché ospite al Tg La7: ""Credo che qui in Sicilia se riusciamo ad arrivare al 40% noi vinciamo tutti e ventidue i collegi delle prossime elezioni nazionali, se il centrodestra è unito in questa Regione non ce n'è per nessuno"".

Secondo Youtrend, se i dati che arrivano dal voto regionale saranno confermati dal voto nazionale di marzo prossimo, alla coalizione di centrodestra andrebbero tra i 12 e i 14 collegi, e tra i 6 gli 8 al Movimento 5 Stelle. Salvo sorprese, il Pd rischia di rimanere a bocca asciutta.",Con questi voti (e con il Rosatellum) alle politiche il Pd non vincerebbe in nessun collegio della Sicilia,http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/06/con-questi-voti-e-con-il-rosatellum-alle-politiche-il-pd-non-vincerebbe-in-nessun-collegio-della-sicilia_a_23268277/

Lo más preocupante, señaló Verónica, es que ""traemos las guías cada ocho días resueltas, pero nuestros hijos están desesperados porque hay cosas que no entienden y habemos adultos que tampoco entendemos, entonces lo único que pedimos es que nos den una solución, que no construyan la escuela en tres minutos, sino que nos den opciones

This year, however, the U.N. faces a new challenge: Addressing the phenomenon after U.S. President Donald Trump, leader of the planet’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged to do nothing to curb emissions.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will deal with that question in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17 as countries work to firm up their commitments to adapt to a warmer world in line with 2015′s landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say the world should prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a benchmark set by the Paris accord. Meeting the target means dramatic reduction in global emissions, and the Paris pact urges signatories to craft voluntary pledges to do that.

However, the agreement is not legally binding, and Trump followed through on a campaign pledge to withdraw America from what he calls the “draconian” pact in June. It is a multi-year process to do so, and the U.S. cannot leave until Nov. 4, 2020 ― the day after the next presidential election.

The U.S. and Syria are now the only two nations opposed to the climate deal.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters Empty seats of U.S. delegation are seen before the opening session of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference 2017, hosted by Fiji but held in Bonn.

The Trump administration announced last week it would actively promote fossil fuels during a presentation at the climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP. Delegates sent by the White House will host a talk titled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” which will tout the supposed benefits of coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

A delegation of U.S. negotiators are expected to work in Bonn to help write the rulebook for the Paris agreement, but their presence will be awkward. It’s unclear if negotiators from other countries will be willing to listen to a White House, which, under Trump, would not abide by any rules that emerge.

The summit will feature some U.S. star power, however. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are funding a pavilion to showcase climate action by U.S. cities and businesses. The federal government usually pays the $200,000 or so cost of the showcase, but declined to do so this year.

“The American people and American industry are pretty much all behind doing what the Paris agreement is designed to do, and that is to cut the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere so we will slow down and maybe even stop climate change, which has the potential to destroy the world,” Bloomberg told The New York Times last month.

Environmental groups and local governments around the U.S. reacted with fury following Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal, but pledged to do their part to combat his agenda with or without federal support. Other world leaders have vowed to move forward regardless, and in July, every member of the G20, aside from the U.S., unveiled a detailed policy to abide by the Paris pact in a clear rebuke of the White House.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters People march during a demonstration two days before the start of the COP 23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 4, 2017.

Trump, while a presidential candidate, notably called climate change a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese and has long promised to end the “war” on fossil fuels. He has signed several executive orders rolling back environmental regulations on the energy industry and has promised an American future flush with “really clean coal.”

But, as HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman reports, such energy doesn’t exist. Environmental groups have long called such rebranding a bait-and-switch by the coal lobby to try and revive an industry dying not due to regulation, but rather the rapidly falling cost of cleaner energy sources.

In fact, the solar industry employed far more people than the coal industry in 2016, according to numbers from the Department of Energy. Natural gas, a far cleaner fossil fuel product in terms of emissions, and oil production jobs are the two leading employers in the industry.

“There is no such thing as ‘clean coal,’” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, told HuffPost in March. “It’s a myth used by the industry to get taxpayer money in order to prop up a dying industry. It’s worse than pixie dust and hope, it’s coal dust and nope. Coal miners deserve a just transition, not snake oil and empty promises.”

Countries gathered in Bonn already understand this. Many of the world’s biggest economies, including China and India, are on track to meet their emissions-reduction targets years earlier than expected, and both have invested heavily in renewable energy.

The talks in Bonn will be relatively low key compared with prior summits, as countries work to refine guidelines and review procedures to ensure signatories are meeting their commitments.

A man in Tamil Nadu was so overcome with anger that some puppies apparently peed in his clothes, that he flung them off a terrace, killing them on the spot. Worse, he boasted about killing the first puppy, posting it on a WhatsApp group, reported The Times of India.

""1 down, 1 more to go, DoggyTales,"" Vishesh Iyengar reportedly posted in a WhatsApp group of some of his classmates at an engineering college in Vellore. ""Black dog down,"" he replied after a group member asked him if the dog was dead.

According to reports, Iyengar killed one black puppy and another light brown puppy soon afterwards. The second puppy had been recently rescued by another resident in the area and was their pet. It had apparently wandered into the apartment complex where Iyengar lives.

A police complaint has been registered at the Katpadi K1 station by animal rights activists. The resident who had rescued the second puppy reportedly claimed that Iyengar did not show any remorse, saying, ""It's just a dog, I didn't kill a human.""

Derzeit arbeitet sich der Chef in Berlin an den Grünen ab, zuhause begehrt die Jugend auf - und Söder sieht täglich seine Chancen wachsen, Seehofer zu beerben.

Eilig hat es Söder nicht. Das wurde auf der JU-Landesversammlung in Erlangen am Sonntag deutlich. ""Mein Wunsch und meine Hoffnung ist, dass wir gemeinsam eine Lösung finden, dass wir es zusammen tun"", sagte er über die künftige personelle Aufstellung der Partei. Wie Seehofer will er erst die Jamaika-Verhandlungen abwarten.

Eilig muss es Söder aber auch nicht haben. Denn die Personaldebatte in der CSU wird kommen - und mit seiner Rede brachte sich Söder gegen Seehofer in Stellung.

Klare Kampfansage

Söder mahnte, die Herausforderung müsse ""mit Anstand"" bewältigt werden - aber auch ""mit Ergebnissen"". Ein ""Weiter so"" dürfe es nicht geben - eine klare Kampfansage gegen Seehofer, kommentierte auch die ""Bild""-Zeitung diesen Satz.

Söder machte in seiner Rede deutlich, wie sehr sich die CSU nun ändern müsse. ""Es muss uns gelingen, unsere Basis zu motivieren und die Wähler ein Stück weit wieder zu inspirieren"", betonte er und forderte: ""Es muss am Ende ein Ruck durch die CSU und durch ganz Bayern gehen.""

""Söder - unsere Nummer 1""

Seehofer steht massiv unter Druck. Am Samstag forderte die bayerische Junge Union (JU) offen seinen Rücktritt.

In einer neuen Umfrage verliert die CSU weiter an Zuspruch: In einer Erhebung des Instituts Insa im Auftrag der ""Bild""-Zeitung vom Montag kommt die CSU nur noch auf 37 Prozent, bei der Bundestagswahl waren es noch etwas mehr als 38 Prozent.

Söder hatte den Mut der bayerischen JU mit ihrer Rücktrittsforderung gelobt. Er setzt zwar auf eine gemeinsame Lösung - die Sympathien der JU gehörten ihm an diesem Tag in Erlangen allerdings schon, wie Fotos zeigten. ""Söder - unsere neue Nummer 1"" stand auf Plakaten.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has shrugged off comments by Greens MP Adam Bandt after he accused the senior Liberal of being a ""terrorist"" over his handling of the Manus Island detention centre crisis.

Bandt told a rally in Melbourne on Saturday that Dutton was prepared to kill for political gain, likening him to a ""terrorist"" for ""threatening people's lives"".

He also said Australia was ""being shamed in the eyes of the world"" for its treatment of the remaining 600 Manus Island asylum seekers, who are said to be without water, power and food after the shutdown of the PNG facility.

Dutton brushed off the criticism, saying the federal government stood by its record on preventing asylum seekers dying at sea.

""I think that says more about Mr Bandt and the Greens than it does about me. The Australian Government has stopped deaths at sea. We've got every child out of detention,"" he said, according to the ABC.

""Mr Bandt, when he was in Government with [former Prime Minister] Julia Gillard, presided over 50,000 people coming on 800 boats and 1,200 people drowned at sea.""

More than 1,000 people gathered at Melbourne's State Library on Saturday for the rally before an action at Federation Square backing the men who remain at the centre, despite its official closure this week.

In Sydney, hundreds rallied in the city's CBD against the treatment of the men.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will discuss the issue on Sunday with newly-elected New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is in Sydney for a whirlwind visit.

Ardern this week confirmed that the previous NZ government's offer to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres still stands amid the ongoing stand-off on Manus.

Labor Senator Doug Cameron said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had failed on the long-running issue.

""The Coalition could have easily done the Bali process, walked there with our neighbours about how we deal with this issue, (and) done international agreements to get people off the island,"" he told the ABC.

""Dennoch setzt nach wie vor eine deutliche Mehrheit auf das Jamaika-Bündnis, weil das allein – nach der Regierungs-Verweigerung der SPD – dem Wählerwillen entspricht"", sagte Güllner.

Großes Interesse an den Sondierungen

Laut n-tv haben in der aktuellen Forsa-Umfrage 50 Prozent der Bevölkerung ein großes Interesse an den Sondierungsgesprächen zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen.

Dabei gebe es keine nennenswerten Differenzen zwischen den Partei-Anhängern. Nur die Nichtwähler seien nicht wirklich interessiert: 24 Prozent von ihnen hielten die Koalitionsgespräche für wichtig.

Keine Unterschiede zwischen Umfrage und Wahlergebnis

Bei einem Scheitern der Koalitionsverhandlungen ständen voraussichtlich Neuwahlen an, die SPD will auch dann keine Koalition mit der Union eingehen. Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt würden Neuwahlen wenig an der Zusammensetzung des Bundestags ändern.

Lediglich die Grünen, die der Umfrage nach auf 10 Prozent kommen, würden mehr als einen Prozentpunkt hinzugewinnen.

""Die Wahlberechtigten sehen keinen Grund, ihre Entscheidung neu zu überdenken""

Güllner sagte dazu gegenüber n-tv: ""Eine Wahlentscheidung ist deshalb nicht einfach, weil ja kaum jemand – auch nicht die meisten Mitglieder einer Partei – hundertprozentig mit allen Vorstellungen einer Partei übereinstimmt. Bei der Stimmabgabe aber muss man sich für eine Partei entscheiden – also eine 'Hundertprozent-Entscheidung' treffen.”

Nachdem die Wahlberechtigten ihre Entscheidung im September gefällt hätten, sähen sie keinen Grund, ihre Entscheidung neu zu überdenken - zumal sich das Erscheinungsbild der einzelnen Parteien seit dem 24. September nicht geändert habe.

“Käme es deshalb heute zu Neuwahlen des Bundestags, würde sich das Ergebnis nur in Nuancen vom Wahlergebnis im September unterscheiden.""

A mediados de los años sesenta, una petrolera perforó grandes pozas en la selva amazónica de Ecuador donde arrojó petróleo de prueba y residuos tóxicos, sin importar que esa práctica fuera dañina. Pasaron 26 años y la empresa se retiró dejando un ecosistema devastado y cerca de mil ""piscinas"" que, cuatro décadas después, siguen filtrando sustancias tóxicas y contaminando las aguas subterráneas. Aunque ha habido diversos juicios contra la empresa, la contaminación provocada por Texaco-Chevron permanece impune a la fecha.

En México, hace tres años, la minera Buenavista del Cobre, filial de Grupo México, contaminó los ríos Sonora y Bacánuchi con más de 40 mil metros cúbicos de ácido de sulfato de cobre, afectando de forma directa a 22 mil personas que viven en los siete municipios situados a orillas del río Sonora, dañando su salud y mermando la productividad de la región. A pesar de los exhortos de Naciones Unidas para que el gobierno mexicano atienda este caso, hasta hoy las autoridades no han castigado a ningún responsable del peor desastre ambiental de la minería en el país.

Situaciones como estas, donde las empresas siguen operando sin problemas, a pesar de haber violentado los derechos de miles o millones de personas, podrían evitarse en el futuro con la existencia de un tratado internacional que las obligue a responder por sus actos.

Esta iniciativa de Tratado Vinculante, ha sido impulsada a nivel mundial por cientos de agrupaciones civiles que llevan más de una década organizándose para llegar a este momento. Más de 200 se hicieron presentes en Ginebra del 23 al 27 de octubre, a fin de impulsar este instrumento diseñado especialmente para frenar los abusos de las grandes corporaciones.

Fue una semana histórica en muchos sentidos, pero sobre todo porque marcó el inicio de la creación de un documento que, de concretarse, proveerá los mecanismos jurídicos necesarios para que las grandes empresas trasnacionales estén obligadas a respetar los derechos humanos y, en consecuencia, quienes han visto violados sus derechos por parte de esas empresas puedan acceder a la justicia y a la remediación.

Y precisamente el acceso a la justicia y a remediar el daño constituyen el centro del debate entre grupos empresariales, representantes de los Estados y asociaciones civiles, pues las empresas argumentan que no se requiere un Tratado Vinculante, sino que basta con cumplir con regulaciones voluntarias como los Principios Rectores sobre las Empresas y los Derechos Humanos que Naciones Unidas aprobó en 2011.

No obstante, como ha señalado Surya Deva, integrante del Grupo de Trabajo de Naciones Unidas sobre Empresas y Derechos Humanos, sin un Tratado Vinculante nunca podremos garantizar el acceso al remedio, porque las violaciones a derechos humanos por parte de las empresas suceden cada vez más en otros países, y si no contamos con una cadena de jurisdicción y de responsabilidad de los Estados a nivel transnacional, las empresas siempre podrán evadir la justicia. No hay ningún motivo para pensar que la implementación de los principios rectores y el desarrollo de un tratado de este tipo no sean procesos complementarios.

La discusión estuvo a cargo del Grupo de Trabajo Intergubernamental de Composición Abierta, especialmente generado para desarrollar el Tratado Vinculante sobre derechos humanos, empresas transnacionales y otras empresas (GTI), liderado por Ecuador con apoyo de Sudáfrica. En las sesiones participaron los estados miembro de la ONU (México incluido), así como agrupaciones empresariales como la International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), la International Organisation of Employees (IOE) y, por supuesto, numerosas organizaciones de la sociedad civil.

A pesar de que las negociaciones iniciaron con críticas a la propuesta hecha por Ecuador (principalmente por la falta de tiempo para consultar al interior de los gobiernos y porque el documento necesita trabajar mejor el sustento jurídico), lo cierto es que al final de la semana se logró un acuerdo sobre los principales temas que debería abordar un tratado de esta naturaleza, y los Estados participantes lograron involucrarse en un debate técnico sobre el contenido para generar este instrumento.

Al término de las discusiones, el pleno acordó que Ecuador deberá definir en breve una hoja de ruta para llegar con un borrador enriquecido para la siguiente sesión del Grupo de Trabajo que se dará en 2018.

Como era de esperarse, las agrupaciones empresariales insistieron en que no son sujetos obligados frente a los derechos humanos, sino que son sólo los Estados quienes deben garantizar su respeto. No obstante, la responsabilidad corporativa frente a los derechos humanos no aumenta ni disminuye si el Estado cumple o no su deber de proteger los derechos humanos, como bien ha señalado John Ruggie, creador de los Principios Rectores de Empresas y Derechos Humanos.

En este punto cabe señalar que, aunque el Tratado Vinculante busca frenar los abusos de las grandes empresas, también permite atacar la captura corporativa del Estado, la cual sucede cuando una élite económica se apropia de la política y la economía nacional para beneficio propio y, como resultado, el estado de derecho falla al obligar a las empresas a rendir cuentas.

Las organizaciones civiles que participaron en la creación de este tratado, entre ellas PODER, ven con optimismo los avances logrados y se mantienen alerta sobre las posibles amenazas contra un instrumento de este tipo. Señalan, por ejemplo la intención de algunos países de la Unión Europea, de cuestionar el mandato de Ecuador dentro del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU en marzo de 2018 para que no se llegue a discutir un nuevo borrador del documento.

Para algunos Estados y la sociedad civil que participa en este proceso, no hay duda de que el mandato del Grupo Intergubernamental de Trabajo ha sido claro desde el inicio de este proceso, y es un mandato que sigue abierto hasta que se genere el Tratado Vinculante. Por ello, confian en que el mandato del Grupo de Trabajo se mantendrá como está y que Ecuador seguirá acompañando el proceso hasta llevarlo a buen puerto. Confian, además, en que los Estados participantes seguirán sumándose para aportar de forma proactiva a este proceso.

Lo que llevó a todas y todos quienes estuvieron en Ginebra fue el consenso de que las empresas transnacionales tienen la obligación de respetar los derechos humanos, y que estas no pueden, ni deben, ser más fuertes que los Estados donde operan.

The old arguments for fossil-fuel power are being blown away by Ørsted, a Danish energy company that has made the switch from black to green energy and firmly believes the rest of us need to follow suit. From 2022, they will offer the lowest ever price for offshore wind in the UK, so we can have our cake and eat it, without hurting the planet while baking it.

“Climate change is a very real threat and we must all take responsibility,” Matthew Wright, managing director, told us. “Transforming the world’s energy supply from coal, oil and gas to renewables is simply the right thing to do.” We asked Matthew about Ørsted’s conversion to a green energy company. How did they manage the breakthrough of making sustainable energy cheaper than fossil fuel? “Offshore wind technology is evolving rapidly and the capacity of an offshore turbine has more than doubled over the last decade. Increased wind farm scale, greater efficiencies and a solid supply chain have been key elements of the success story to date, but we cannot overlook the role of successive UK governments in providing the certainty needed for continued investment in offshore wind, enabling it to become the thriving industry it is today.” When you think that the first wind farm was only built in 1991, you realise how young the sustainable energy industry is. It is only going to get more and more efficient. But it can’t have been easy transforming a conventional fossil energy-based company into a renewable energy pioneer. “It’s quite an achievement when you consider that just five years ago, offshore wind was still a young and relatively small-scale technology with high costs when compared to fossil fuels. We made a bold decision to divest our upstream oil and gas business, and to stop all use of coal. We’ve ramped up our green investments and have become the world’s largest developer of offshore wind. “One of the biggest, and arguably most important tasks came in 2012, when the UK government set the industry a challenge to reduce the cost of offshore wind. The industry rose to the challenge and smashed the target three years ahead of schedule. Our Hornsea Project Two wind farm was recently awarded a contract at the lowest ever price for offshore in the UK. This is an incredible achievement not just for us as a company but for the whole industry, making offshore wind cheaper than newly built coal or gas fired power plants,” Matthew reveals.

Greg Abbott said Monday. Devin Patrick Kelley, 26, the suspect in the massacre at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs that killed at least 26 and wounded 20, had in-laws who occasionally attended services at the church, but weren’t there on Sunday, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt told reporters. “I do believe that there was a connection between him and this location that will come to light over the coming days,” Abbott (R) said during an appearance on “CBS This Morning” on Monday. “I don’t think this church was picked out at random. I think there was purpose and intent that Devin Kelley had in showing up at this location.”

Kelley, wearing a bulletproof vest and black tactical gear, opened fire on churchgoers using an “assault-type rifle” around 11:30 a.m. during Sunday prayer service, according to law enforcement officials. The suspected gunman most recently lived in New Braunfels, roughly 30 miles northeast of San Antonio, reported the Texas Department of Public Safety. He previously lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, according to public records. Kelley is a former member of the U.S. Air Force who served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014, according to USAF spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. The Air Force said late Sunday that Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and their child. He received a bad conduct discharge, a 12-month sentence in a military prison and a reduction in rank for the offense.

A former neighbor told the Times that someone called the police to report that Kelley struck his pit bull puppy in the head. The case was later dismissed. Abbott on Monday called Kelley “a powder keg waiting to go off” and said state law should have prevented him from buying a gun.

MONTREAL - Valérie Plante scored a stunning upset in Montreal's mayoral election on Sunday, defeating incumbent Denis Coderre to become the first woman to win the post.

Coderre said just after 10:30 p.m. that he'd called Plante to congratulate her. He later announced he was leaving municipal politics.

In her victory speech, Plante reiterated her campaign promises, which include improving public transit and lessening road congestion, as well as adding green spaces and social housing.

""During the course of this campaign, I had one goal in mind: I wanted to put Montrealers first and I'm not going to change that,"" she told a roomful of cheering supporters at a downtown theatre.

""I'm going to put Montrealers first, I'm going to get Montreal moving again, I'm going to build safer roads for pedestrians, seniors and cyclists.""

Plante, 43, was leading with over 51 per cent of the vote with almost all polls reporting, compared to just under 46 per cent for Coderre.

""We have made history,"" she tweeted. ""Thank you, Montreal!""

Plante will be the first female mayor elected in Montreal in the city's 375-year history, and Montreal will be the largest North American city with a female mayor, according to CTV News.

She entered municipal politics in 2013 when she won a council seat in a contest that pitted her against former provincial cabinet minister Louise Harel.

In 2016, she was elected leader of the left-leaning party Projet Montreal.

Plante began the mayoral race as a relative unknown but opinion polls showed her steadily gaining on Coderre as the campaign continued.

Valérie Plante's supporters react as votes comes in projecting her win on election night during the municipal election in Montreal on Sunday.

The mother of two, who cycles or takes public transit to work, sought throughout the campaign to present herself as less flamboyant and more in touch with Montrealers than her opponent.

Her signature campaign promise was a new 29-stop subway line that would link the city's densely populated northeast to downtown.

During her victory speech, she appealed to the provincial and federal governments to partner with her on her two biggest campaign promises: the subway line and increasing social housing in the city.

""In Quebec and Ottawa, I invite you to act on the strong message that Montrealers are sending you,"" she said.

""I know we can't do it tomorrow, but we can start working together, immediately, for those who need it most.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saluted Plante's historic victory in a tweet late Sunday night.

Congratulations @Val_Plante, first-ever woman elected mayor of Montreal! I'm looking forward to working together on our shared priorities. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) November 6, 2017

""Congratulations @Val_Plante, first-ever woman elected mayor of Montreal! I'm looking forward to working together on our shared priorities,"" he wrote.

The outgoing Coderre, a former Liberal MP and cabinet minister who was elected mayor in 2013, had campaigned largely on his record.

He had highlighted his ambitious infrastructure renewal plan, naming an inspector general to oversee the awarding of city contracts, and negotiating increased powers for the city from the province.

But while Montreal's economy has boomed during his mandate, Coderre was often branded by opponents as an arrogant leader who makes hasty decisions with little consultation.

He was criticized for spending millions on showy projects to celebrate the city's 375th birthday, and drew the ire of dog lovers when he introduced legislation last year to ban pit bulls from the city.

Outgoing Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre makes his concession speech after losing the municipal election on Sunday in Montreal.

In his concession speech, Coderre announced he would be leaving municipal politics but said he remained proud of what he'd accomplished.

""I'm leaving with my head high,"" he said. ""Montreal is an exceptional city, Montreal is a metropolis that is the envy of the world.""

Incumbents fared better elsewhere in the province, including in Quebec City where Mayor Regis Labeaume easily won a fourth term.

Marc Demers was re-elected in Laval, as was Yves Levesque in Trois-Rivieres and Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin in Gatineau.

Valérie Plante stands on a Montreal street corner on Wednesday.

There was a surprise in Sherbrooke, however, where incumbent Bernard Sevigny lost the mayoral race to independent candidate Steve Lussier.

Some 858 municipal elections were held across the province, with over 8,000 mayor or councillor jobs up for grabs.

Of those, about half were already filled by election day by candidates who ran unopposed.

SITTWE, Myanmar - Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on Thursday urged people ""not to quarrel"" as she visited Rakhine State for the first time since a military crackdown that drove more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country.

Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has faced heavy international criticism for not taking a higher profile in responding to what U.N. officials have called ""ethnic cleansing"" by the army.

Myanmar has rejected the accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces launched a counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts in northern Rakhine on Aug. 25.

On Thursday, amid heightened security, Suu Kyi boarded a military helicopter at Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to be taken to Maungdaw, one of the districts worst hit by the violence.

Suu Kyi met a group of Muslim religious leaders, said Chris Lewa, of the Arakan Project monitoring group, citing Rohingya sources.

""She only said three things to the people - they should live peacefully, the government is there to help them, and they should not quarrel among each other,"" Lewa said, quoting information from a religious leader who was present.

Rohingya began fleeing predominantly Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in late August to escape violence in the wake of a military counter-insurgency operation launched after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Rakhine State.

A U.S. State Department delegation will be in Bangladesh on Friday and Saturday to discuss the humanitarian crisis and human rights concerns stemming from the crisis in Rakhine state.

The delegation will be led by Simon Henshaw, acting assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, the department said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Reuters photographers saw thousands of desperate Rohingya wade through shallows and narrow creeks between islands of the Naf river to reach neighbouring Bangladesh as the exodus begun two months ago was far from over.

Some had small boats or pulled makeshift rafts to get to Bangladesh on the river's western bank, but most walked, children cradled in their arms and the elderly carried on their backs, with sacks of belongings tied to staves on their shoulders.

Reaching the far side, some women and older people had to be pulled through the mud to reach dry land atop steep banks.

More than 4,000 crossed at different points on the river on Wednesday, Major Mohammed Iqbal, a Bangladesh security official in the southern district of Cox's Bazar, told Reuters.","Aung San Suu Kyi Visits Rahkine For First Time Since Exodus Of 60,000 Rohingya Muslims",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/aung-san-suu-kyi-visits-rahkine-for-first-time-since-exodus-of-60-000-rohingya-muslims_a_23265317/

Amy Allen, then 18, of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, was due to start her first year of a psychology degree at York St John’s University, when she saw her GP because her period had stopped. Not long after, she received the diagnosis. Now 21 and recently graduated, Amy said: “I was the first person in living memory in Yorkshire to be diagnosed with that type of ovarian tumour, a Sertoli-Leydig sex cord tumour. “I went to the hospital appointment alone and hearing the words, ‘It’s cancer’ was incredibly shocking.”

PA Real Life Features Amy Allen (right) pictured with a friend.

Initially, Amy, the eldest of four children, was wrongly suspected of suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as her symptoms were very similar. PCOS causes many small and harmless follicles to grow on the ovaries and has symptoms including irregular or no periods and excess body and facial hair. Recalling the moment her GP told her she needed further tests during freshers’ week, Amy said: “The doctor from home rang me to ensure I was getting checked out. My blood test results had revealed that my testosterone levels were 2.5 times higher than they should be, and my oestrogen levels were significantly lower.” Subsequent ultra-scan and MRI scans carried out at York Hospital in late 2014 indicated that Amy had a suspected cyst on her ovary. In March 2015, she had this biopsied, so it could be examined more closely. Amy continued: “Seven weeks had passed and I’d had my first period in a year and I thought everything was dandy. My periods had started at about 14, but after a few years they gave me very severe lower back pain and I developed bad facial hair. Then they stopped not long after I turned 18.” Contacted about a post-biopsy appointment, Amy went alone, believing everything was fine, only to be told she had cancer. She recalled: “The doctors and nurses were so nice. They explained everything and we had a laugh about the rarity and excitement of the type of tumour – the first one to be diagnosed in Yorkshire. “If I hadn’t laughed I would have cried.” But she saved her tears until she could call her housemates, when she sobbed down the phone. “Getting the diagnosis was the scariest day of my life and a memory that will stay with me for a while,” she admitted. “At 19 years old and coming towards the end of my first year of university, cancer was not something I thought I’d personally have to go through.”",Graduate Reveals How Missed Period And Facial Hair Turned Out To Be Signs Of Rare Cancer,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/graduate-reveals-how-missed-period-turned-out-to-be-rare-ovarian-cancer_uk_5a003dcee4b0baea26331b28

Depuis quelques semaines, Marine Le Pen parcourt la France dans l'espoir de renouveler un parti fondé il y a plus de 45 ans. Samedi 4 novembre, cette ""tournée de refondation"" a fait une halte à Fontenay-Trésigny, en Seine-et-Marne, où environ 500 sympathisants frontistes se sont réunis pour un déjeuner-débat avec leur présidente.

L'occasion pour Marine Le Pen de s'inscrire dans la continuité d'un discours sans ambiguïté sur ses thèmes de prédilection (terrorisme, immigration, identité, etc.), mais aussi d'appeler sa famille politique à une nouvelle ""culture de gouvernement"" et non de simple opposition. ""Cela passe par une révolution culturelle interne, à laquelle je vous exhorte. Ne plus se contenter de commenter l'actualité, mais de construire, à tous les échelons, de véritables contre-projets"", a expliqué la présidente du FN devant les électeurs et plusieurs cadres du parti.

Mais, au fait, Marine Le Pen est-elle à l'abri de cette ""refondation"" ? Lors de ce rassemblement, si nous avons rencontré une majorité d'électeurs toujours aussi fidèles à leur présidente, certains n'ont pas hésité à exprimer leurs doutes, à critiquer parfois durement leur présidente ou même à réclamer son départ face à notre caméra, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo tête d'article. Des témoignages plutôt inhabituels dans un meeting politique, de surcroît dans un parti où le culte du chef est aussi fort.

Il serait toutefois surprenant de voir Marine Le Pen quitter bientôt la tête du parti fondé par son père, puisqu'elle sera... la seule candidate à sa succession lors du congrès prévu en mars 2018.

Don't do this.

Egg safety in Canada

In Europe, it's common to store eggs at room temperature, but because of differences in production practices, that is not advised in North America.

Fresh eggs should always be stored in the fridge, and never frozen, according to Health Canada. They should never be kept at room temperature for more than two hours, whether they're raw or cooked, the agency added.

Article continues below video.

And as for their place in the fridge?

""Eggs should be refrigerated as soon as possible in the coldest section of the refrigerator (usually the body of the fridge),"" Health Canada said.

Keeping them in their carton will also help protect eggs from damage, Health Canada said. The agency noted that eggs can sometimes be contaminated with salmonella and other bacteria that could cause food poisoning.

""Jünger und weiblicher"" sollte die SPD nach dem Debakel bei der Bundestagswahl werden. Zu sehen ist davon allerdings bisher wenig. Parteichef Martin Schulz drängt nun laut einem Medienbericht auf eine umfassende Reform der SPD.

Die Mitglieder sollen künftig in Personalfragen - auch auf Bundesebene - stärker mitbestimmen können. Das stehe in einem entsprechenden Leitantrag für den Bundesparteitag im Dezember, berichtet der ""Spiegel"".

Ziel sei es, spätestens 2019 über den SPD-Vorsitz per Urwahl abstimmen zu lassen, zitiert das Nachrichtenmagazin Parteikreise. Bislang ist eine Urwahl nur für die Frage der Kanzlerkandidatur vorgesehen.

""Der Kanzlerkandidat und die SPD haben die Wahl verloren""

In dem Papier gehe Schulz auch überraschend hart mit dem SPD-Wahlkampf ins Gericht. ""Nicht die Medien, nicht die Demoskopen und auch nicht die politischen Gegner sind schuld an unserer Wahlniederlage"", zitiert der ""Spiegel"" daraus.

""Der Kanzlerkandidat und die gesamte SPD haben diese Wahl verloren."" Vielen Wählern sei nicht klar gewesen, wofür die SPD stehe.

Zudem habe es an einer klaren Botschaft an die Wähler gefehlt. Viele Wähler hätten den Eindruck gehabt, ""die SPD treibe jeden Tag eine 'neue Sau durch das Dorf', schreibe Schulz in dem Reformpapier.

""Eine verständliche Erzählung, wo wir mit dem Land hinwollen, fehlt - und damit eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für echte Zukunftskompetenz"", zitiert der ""Spiegel"" weiter.

Ruf nach Erneuerung

Schulz' Papier sei weder ""revolutionär"", noch biete es ein ""fertiges Konzept für den Wiederaufbau der SPD"", kommentiert das Nachrichtenmagazin. Allerdings enthalte das Dokumente viele Anhaltspunkte, wie es für die Sozialdemokraten weitergehen könnte.

Zuletzt hatte Hamburgs Bürgermeister Olaf Scholz sich mit einem Papier in die Debatte um die Erneuerung der SPD eingemischt. Er forderte eine ""schonungslose Betrachtung der Lage"".

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Quel pubblico che la Rai vezzeggiava con lo slogan ""Rai.","Quando Milena Gabanelli ha annunciato che avrebbe lasciato la direzione di Report, il programma che aveva creato vent'anni prima, abbiamo tutti avuto un sussulto.

Non accade spesso di vedere una giornalista con un posto sicuro e di grande visibilità, alla conduzione di un programma che non ha smesso di crescere e mietere ascolti e riconoscimenti, dire ""Sono stati vent'anni indimenticabili, grazie di tutto"" e lasciare con fiducia la conduzione al co-autore che la affianca da dieci anni, Sigfrido Ranucci. Lui – ed è anche questo in fondo un merito di Gabanelli – non ci ha fatto sentire la sua mancanza a Report.

Nel panorama Rai l'assenza di Gabanelli si è fatta invece sentire via via sempre di più.

Non era un segreto per nessuno che avrebbe voluto misurarsi con l'informazione digitale. Ma il sito di Rai News, che pure ambiva a modellarsi su quello di Bbc News – una testata digitale con cui collaborano tutti/e i/le giornalisti/e della Bbc, al di là delle produzioni radiotelevisive in cui operano – rischia di restare una Cinquecento che sogna di essere una Rolls Royce, un doppione digitale dei servizi esistenti, con una redazione ristretta, tempi incerti, futuro nebuloso.

Gabanelli ha allora proposto un format che ancora una volta coglie un trend nuovo nell'informazione: data journalism, giornalismo basato sui dati. Ovvero una striscia quotidiana di 4 minuti, dopo il tiggì delle 20, per raccontare un fatto con i numeri. Quattro minuti in cui coniugare innovazione e maturità professionale, quella acquisita in vent'anni di Report.

All'ennesimo rifiuto, condito con la controproposta irricevibile di tornare a Report, è arrivata la lettera di dimissioni, che diventeranno operative il prossimo 15 novembre.

Ma la Rai non può perdere una professionista come Milena Gabanelli. Perché allora avrebbero ragione quelli che pensano che per una come lei non c'è posto nella ""Rai-carrozzone al servizio della politica"".

Ci piace immaginare la Rai innanzitutto come un servizio pubblico. Ci piace anche immaginare che il pubblico in questi vent'anni ha ampiamente dimostrato, a suon di indici di ascolto, che il posto di Milena Gabanelli è alla Rai. Rinunciare a lei sarebbe un tragico, colpevole, autogol.

Per questo l'Associazione 99% ha lanciato questa petizione.

Si chiede alla Rai di non privarsi di una professionista del calibro di Milena Gabanelli.

Inoltre, si chiede alla Rai, come utenti del servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo pagato con il canone di abbonamento da noi tutti cittadini e cittadine, di affidare a Milena Gabanelli una striscia d'informazione quotidiana, a completamento e integrazione dei servizi d'informazione già in onda, così come la giornalista ha proposto. Quattro minuti di fatti raccontati attraverso i numeri.

Una simile concessione non potrà essere letta come una resa dei vertici aziendali alle richieste di una sua dipendente, ma come l'accoglimento di una richiesta del pubblico.

No, I’m not talking about going to see the latest Batman movie (who says I’m not topical?) – this is the OODD Guide to Eating Out with a Baby.

Trust me, this will change your life *.

*It probably won’t.

There comes a time in every parent’s life when sitting in your nappy-scented home, for hour after hour, cleaning up sick, sterilizing bottles and watching Judge Rinder, is no longer is the fun it once was. It’s at this point that the idea of taking your child to eat in a restaurant first crosses your mind.

Yet you’re reticent, with good reason.

What will the baby do?

Will it scream?

Will it do an explosive poo?

Will it do both?

Will it stare (like a miniature psychopath) at a frail old lady – putting her off her soup?

And then there’s the other diners to think of…

Will they be friendly?

Will they glare?

Will they complain to the management because of the noise?

Will they form a mob to have you ejected?

All of this potential stress is often enough to stop parents from leaving the confines of their homes. Don’t let this happen to you!

Here’s my advice on how to Eat Out with a Baby.

1: Don’t be an arsehole

The arrival of a baby in a restaurant is never EVER EVER going to make its parents popular. We’ve all been there. You go out for a quiet meal, perhaps in the hope of it going so well that you skip dessert, and next thing you know a family who look like they’d struggle to fill out a Jeremy Kyle Show application form arrives at the next table with their screaming feral offspring. Your meal is ruined – you eat quickly and call for the bill. The family on the next table, however, are having a great time.

Don’t be that family.

A little consideration for your fellow diners goes a long way. It’ll make your meal a lot more pleasant to know everyone else in the room isn’t hating your guts.

2: Don’t be too nice

Trying to be considerate to other diners is all very well – but don’t be crippled by it. Children make noise, it’s as simple as that. As long as you appear to be making attempts to minimize the chaos you’re doing your job. You’re not going to have a silent meal, it’s impossible. Don’t let your baby making normal baby sounds ruin your meal. You need a break too.

3: Be prepared

If you’re properly prepared then the whole ‘eating out’ experience will be infinitely easier. That said, for many new parents, leaving the house wearing two matching shoes can be a struggle, so let’s not set our sights too high here!

It’s totally possible to get through a meal with ease, by timing it to coincide with your baby’s naptime. Bring essentials like milk and their favourite toys to ease any transition periods. That said, even the most prepared person in the world might find themselves in a restaurant with a baby who suddenly refuses to play ball.

4: Lower your standards

Do you like eating out at nice restaurants? Sorry, but those days are over. From now on you’ll be dining in places that have ‘Happy’, ‘Big’ & ‘Wacky’ in their titles. The food is undeniably crap, the tables are sticky and there’s a constant whiff of vomit, but you’ll feel so much more relaxed in these places. Why? Well, for one thing, there’ll always be another kid doing exactly what you were dreading. So, if your child does melt down, it’s unlikely anyone will notice.

NB: A bit of advice, never eat from a buffet bar in one of these establishments. They are are at the perfect height for little (snotty) hands to reach and play with the food – before putting in back.

5: Go Early

Visiting a restaurant during peak times will put you in line for a whole heap of pain. Late food, loud customers, stroppy staff and over-crowded eating areas are no fun with a baby.

Perhaps consider going for your meal early or late? Dinner at 2 am is sure to leave you with the place to yourself. If this is too extreme find out when an establishment starts serving food and be there on the dot. A Sunday Roast at 1030 am may seem weird, but it’s far a more relaxed than eating it at 1 pm like everyone else.

6: Be ready with comebacks

Having a few witty retorts to use with the inevitable malcontents you’ll experience will make your trip much easier. When you find Clive and Norma moaning about the noise you’re making, glaring from behind their copies of The Mail On Sunday, be sure to respond appropriately. Loudly shouting phrases such as: “He may be still infectious, I’m not sure!” and “I’ll take him outside to change his nappy on the bonnet of that Lexus” will leave you feeling far more relaxed.

7: Other options

Perhaps, if you feel going out to eat with your baby is just too much stress, you could make a meal at home feel like you’re in a restaurant. Consider inviting some strangers into your home to glare in your direction, as you eat cold, substandard food. In many ways, with a bit of effort, eating in can be just as much ‘fun’ as eating out.

***

If you have any advice on Eating Out With a Baby, keep it to yourself. Nobody likes a know-it-all!

Dabei wird es heute um die Themenfelder Innen, Sicherheit und Rechtsstaat gehen.

Auch die Legalisierung von Cannabis, die sich sowohl Grüne als auch FDP ins Wahlprogramm geschrieben haben, wird Gegenstand der Verhandlungen sein. Fünf Gründe, warum die Union sich nicht dagegen stellen sollte:

1. Jugendschutz im Mittelpunkt

Bei jungen Menschen, deren Körper noch nicht voll ausgewachsen sind, ist der Konsum von Cannabis gefährlich: Es kann zu Entwicklungsverzögerungen kommen und psychosoziale Störungen, sogar Psychosen hervorrufen.

Weshalb dann die Legalisierung? Werden dadurch nicht mehr Kinder und Jugendliche kiffen? Das Gegenteil ist der Fall. In Deutschland ist es leichter Gras zu kaufen, als eine Flasche Wodka im Supermarkt. Denn dort gilt der Jugendschutz und an der Kasse wird der Ausweis kontrolliert - der Dealer wird danach jedoch nicht fragen.

Eine Legalisierung geht immer mit der kontrollierten Abgabe in zertifizierten Shops einher. Dadurch wird es für die Risikogruppe von Heranwachsenden schwerer an Gras zu kommen und sie werden besser vor den Gefahren des Konsums geschützt.

2. Schwarzmarkt austrocknen

Der Markt für Drogen in Deutschland wird auf ca. 2,5 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr geschätzt. Der größte Teil davon entfällt auf Cannabis. Die Vertriebswege entziehen sich der staatlichen Kontrolle. Verkauft wird in den dunklen Ecken der städtischen Parks oder in der Raucherecke hinter dem Bahnhof.

Die Dealer selbst sind häufig nur kleine Rädchen in einem System, das weit über sie selbst hinausgeht. Die Verlegung in legale Verkaufsstellen, in denen Qualität und Reinheit der Substanzen sichergestellt sind, würde zu einer Austrocknung des Schwarzmarkts führen. Und damit den Hintermännern eine wichtige Einnahmequelle entziehen.

Das wäre ein wichtiger und überfälliger Schritt um der organisierten Kriminalität in Deutschland entgegenzuwirken. An gefährlichen Parallelstrukturen kann insbesondere die Rechtsstaatspartei CDU kein Interesse haben.

3. Prävention und Steuereinnahmen

Findet der Verkauf nicht mehr beim Dealer im Park, sondern in einer zertifizierten Verkaufsstelle statt, so profitiert der Staat von den Steuereinnahmen. Allein die Umsatzsteuer von 19 % würde schätzungsweise zusätzliche Steuereinnahmen von rund 350 Millionen Euro generieren.

Eine zusätzliche Verbrauchsteuer wie sie etwa für Zigaretten erhoben wird, verspricht weitere Einnahmen. Einen Teil davon sollte man für Aufklärung und Prävention von Jugendlichen verwenden.

Informationen über die Risiken einer Droge sind abschreckender als Verbote. Das muss auch die CDU erkennen und sich für die Legalisierung aussprechen.

4. Konsum ja, Sucht nein

Etwa ein Drittel der 18-25-jährigen hat Cannabis schon einmal ausprobiert. Regelmäßig rauchen allerdings nur ca. 3,5 %. Zwar ist das Suchtpotenzial von Cannabisprodukten sehr gering und sie sind weniger schädlich als die Volksdrogen Alkohol und Tabak.

Zum Vergleich: Etwa 3,3 Millionen Menschen sterben weltweit an Alkohol oder den Folgen des Konsums. Ein Todesfall durch Cannabis ist hingegen nicht bekannt.

Dennoch: Bei einigen Jugendlichen in dieser Gruppe wird man von einem problematischen Konsum sprechen müssen. Einer Abhängigkeit, die den schulischen und beruflichen Erfolg und das Sozialleben massiv beeinträchtigen kann.

Diesen jungen Menschen muss man helfen, mit Aufklärung und Therapie. Ein Verbot der Droge hilft hier allerdings nicht: Die Angst vor einer Strafe hindert den Abhängigen, seine Sucht einzugestehen und Hilfe zu suchen.

Die Nächstenliebe gebietet es, Menschen in Not zu helfen, statt ihnen mit Strafe zu drohen: Auch die Christdemokraten sollten sich deshalb für die Legalisierung einsetzen.

5. Entlastung der Polizei

Wenn ich an einem lauen Sommerabend durch einen Park in Hamburg-Eimsbüttel laufe, riecht es nach Gras. Aber nicht kleinkriminelle Jugendliche rauchen da einen Joint, sondern Familienväter oder Studentengruppen, die sich nach dem Picknick eine „Feierabend-Tüte"" gönnen.

Das Gefühl, dabei etwas Kriminelles zu tun, eine Straftat zu begehen, haben viele schon lange nicht mehr. Ein wirkungsloses Verbot muss aber schon zugunsten des Vertrauens in den Rechtsstaat abgeschafft werden.

Die Verfolgung von Gelegenheitskiffern ist nämlich vor allem eines: Sinnlose Bürokratie. 145.000 Cannabis-Delikte werden jährlich erfasst. Etliche der Verfahren werden aber eingestellt und es kommt nicht zu einer Verurteilung.

Das verschwendet sowohl Arbeitszeit als auch Geld bei Polizei, Staatsanwaltschaft und den Gerichten. Und das obwohl die Justiz und die Polizisten besseres zu tun hätten: Die Zahlen von Einbruchsdiebstählen steigen seit Jahren, die Zahl von gefährlichen oder schweren Körperverletzungen stieg 2016 um fast 10 %.

Die Bundesregierung hat eine Verantwortung gegenüber Bürgern und Polizisten. Echte Straftaten müssen verhindert und verfolgt werden.

Wenn CDU/CSU die Gesundheit von jungen Menschen am Herzen liegt, sie den Schwarzmarkt bekämpfen und stattdessen zusätzliche Steuereinnahmen nutzen möchte, dann sollte sie sich für die Legalisierung einsetzen.

Je früher sie kommt, desto schneller wird Suchtkranken geholfen und die Strafverfolgungsbehörden hätten endlich mehr Zeit, sich um richtige Verbrecher zu kümmern. Jamaika bietet diese Chancen. Die Union sollte sie erkennen und nutzen.

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

Additionally, these men have a 29 per cent greater risk of melanoma (a type of skin cancer) and a 40 per cent increased likelihood of stomach cancer.
Additionally, men who have Peyronie's disease running in their family may have cause for concern, since certain genes associated with the condition can also be found in urological cancers.
""It's not yet fully understood what causes Peyronie's disease and it's possible it shares some similar risk factors to cancer,"" Emma Shields, of the British charity Cancer Research U.K., told The Telegraph.","Having a curved penis might have its benefits in the bedroom, but a new study has found that those who have this condition are at a higher risk of cancer.

The research, which was published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, looked at more than 1.5 million men and found a significant connection between Peyronie's disease — a condition that causes men to have a bent, erect penis — and stomach, skin, and testicular cancers.

Peyronie's disease is caused when scar tissue, known as plaque, forms inside the soft tissue of the penis causing it to curve when erect. This can be painful for some and can even cause erectile dysfunction.

Though Medical News Today reports that the scar tissue in the penis is not cancerous, the new study found noteworthy connections to urological cancers.

After reviewing data from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, researchers determined that those with Peyronie's disease, also known as a penile fibrosis, had an increased risk of testicular cancer by 40 per cent. Additionally, these men have a 29 per cent greater risk of melanoma (a type of skin cancer) and a 40 per cent increased likelihood of stomach cancer.

""Nobody has made these associations before,"" said urologist and study lead, Dr. Alexander Pastuszak, according to The Telegraph.

""We think this is important because these conditions are largely taken for granted,"" he continued. ""While they're significant in the sexual and reproductive life-cycles of these patients, linking them to other disorders suggest that these men should be monitored for development of these disorders disproportionately in contrast to the rest of the population.""

If you have a curved penis, don't panic just yet. According to Medical Daily, it's common for men to have a slight bend in their shaft, since the human body is rarely symmetrical.

Dr. Pastuszak also backed this up, saying, ""A slight curve can be normal. There is some curvature in all penises.""

Although penile fibrosis is most common among older men, specifically between the ages of 40 and 60, younger men can also get the disease. Risk factors include injury to the penis and genetics.

Additionally, men who have Peyronie's disease running in their family may have cause for concern, since certain genes associated with the condition can also be found in urological cancers.

""It's not yet fully understood what causes Peyronie's disease and it's possible it shares some similar risk factors to cancer,"" Emma Shields, of the British charity Cancer Research U.K., told The Telegraph.

NEW DELHI -- The all-powerful GST Council may consider lowering tax rates on a host of goods such as handmade furniture, plastic products and daily use items like shampoo, and simplify return filing rules in its meeting this week.

The council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is scheduled to meet on November 10 to consider lowering of the 28% GST rate on certain common use items, government officials said.

In further relief to small and medium enterprises, the panel is likely to rationalise tax rate in sectors where the total incidence of taxation has gone up because the goods were earlier either exempt from excise or was attracted lower VAT rates in the previous indirect tax regime.

The council has been meeting every month since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which amalgamated over a dozen central and state taxes, was introduced on July 1.

The meetings have resulted in an array of changes to ease compliance burden on businesses as well as provided relief to consumers.

""A rationalisation of items in the 28% tax bracket is expected. Most of the daily use items could be lowered to 18%. Also tax rate on items like furniture, electric switches, plastic pipes could be relooked,"" an official said.

All types of furniture attract a 28% tax under GST. Wooden furniture is handmade by unorganised sector artisans and is mostly used by middle class families and there have been demands for lowering tax incidence on them.

Also, some items of plastic attract 18% GST but goods like shower baths, sinks, wash basins, bidets, lavatory pans, seats and covers, flushing cisterns and similar sanitary ware of plastics attract 28% levy.

There is a need for rationalisation of tax rates on these items, officials said. The plastic manufacturers in their representation to the revenue department had said that 80% of the industry is in MSME category.

Besides, the GST rate on weighing machines, compressors may also be rationalised to 18% from 28%.

Officials said 90% of the manufacturers are from small and medium industries who in the pre-GST era were exempt from excise duty on manufactured value of less than Rs 1.5 crore.

Hence, such machines only attracted VAT of 14.5%. With regard to compressors, the total pre-GST incidence was 17.5% (12.5% excise duty and 5% VAT), they said stressing on need to rationalise the tax incidence.

The GST Council, which comprises of representatives of all states, have already rationalised tax rates for over 100 items. The Council has last month approved an Approach Paper to be followed by the fitment committee while deciding on future rate revisions.

Under GST various goods and services have been bracketed in 5, 12, 18 and 28%.

To hear a spiritual phrase that Muslims use in their everyday lives twisted in this violent way is incredibly frustrating, said Rabiah Ahmed, director of media and public affairs at the Muslim Public Affairs Council.

″[Allahu Akbar] has been used in traditional Muslim prayers for centuries and is used as a peaceful reminder of their religious commitment. They are also the opening words of the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) and is also often used in approval in the same way Christians say Amen,’” Ahmed told HuffPost.

“Its extremely painful and frustrating [to see it misused], and unfortunately, just another example of how our religion is co-opted by those those who act outside of it.”

A Phrase With A Profound Spiritual History

The phrase Allahu akbar has a long history of use within Islam. It expresses a sentiment that is at its heart a theological reflection about humanity’s place in the world: That no matter what trials or victories people face, God is greater than it all.

It appears a few times in the Quran, but only mid-sentence, according to Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. The phrase is more explicit in the sunnah, a set of teachings about the way of life modeled by Islam’s founder, the Prophet Muhammad.

Suleiman pointed in particular to a hadith ― one of the collected reports about the prophet ― where Muhammad is recorded as saying, “Allah is Greater, Mightier than all His creation. He is Mightier than what I fear and dread.”

“What it suggests is that God is greater than all our concerns, God is greater than all that is ascribed to him, greater than all the disappointments we have,” Suleiman said. “God is greater than our pain, God is greater than our material possessions.”

Allahu akbar is an affirmation of a belief in a monotheistic God, Suleiman said ― since it suggests that God has no partners. Belief in absolute monotheism is a core part of orthodox Islamic theology.

The phrase Allahu akbar is also used by non-Muslim Arab speakers, since “Allah” is the Arabic word for God. Some Christians from Syria, Lebanon, and other regions in the Levant, say Allahu akbar to express surprise, excitement, puzzlement or dismay ― in the same way that English speakers may use the phrase “Oh my God.” (It’s not a religious pronouncement for these Christians, however, and some Arab Christians, such as Egypt’s Copts, do not use it.)

From a theological point of view, the idea that God is greater than human circumstances is not limited to Islam. In English, one verse of the Bible declares, “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”

A popular Christian worship song by the band MercyMe is based on the verse. Another wildly popular Christian song, by the musician Chris Tomlin, states, “Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other.”

Saying Allahu Akbar In Prayer, Joy And Sadness

For Muslims, the phrase Allahu akbar is built into the prayers that are one of the pillars of Islam. It begins the call to prayer, or “adhan.” It’s also used as a verbal transition between the different positions Muslims assume during prayer ― standing up, bowing, kneeling, prostrating on the ground.

“There’s something extremely powerful about saying Allahu akbar and then prostrating yourself, putting your face on the ground in supplication to our creator,” Suleiman said. “In Islam, the greatest position of prayer is prostration ― the more you lower yourself to God, the higher he elevates you.”

Outside of the context of formal prayer, Allahu akbar is also used by Muslims in moments of celebration, such as when someone passes a hard exam or is accepted into college. It is also said in times of sorrow ― such as when a dearly loved one passes away.

The phrase is often the first sound Muslims whisper into a baby’s ears at birth and one of the last sounds they hear during a burial, as a body is lowered into the grave.

Suleiman said that often during Islamic fundraisers, every time someone raises their hand to donate the whole audience will say Allahu akbar in celebration of the act of charity.

The phrase is so much a part of daily life that Qasim Rashid, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in America, estimates that he’s said it more than 1.6 million times over the course of his life ― just because of the five daily prayers.

“[Praying] five times a day, since I was about seven years old, it comes out to about 1.6 million times over the last 28 years or so,” Rashid told HuffPost. “That doesn’t include when I said Allahu akbar when my kids were born, or when I helped build a hospital, or Michael Jordan made the game winning shot in the NBA finals.”

“It’s part of our celebratory mode, and to believe that it could mean something violent is asinine,” he said.

The Consequences Of Misusing The Phrase

Despite the prevalence of this religious concept, Hind Makki, an interfaith educator and activist, told HuffPost said she feels that a stigma has become attached to the phrase in American culture ― particularly when it is said in Arabic.

“It’s one of those Arabic phrases that people who aren’t Muslim or aren’t really familiar with Islam treat with dread because they connect it to a crime,” she said.

“It’s frustrating because we have seen how many mass shootings and mass murders there have been recently and several of the suspects, I would assume have some kind of ideological bent,” she said, referring in particular to the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, whose rampage in October left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. “But because the person is not from a Muslim background, or didn’t yell Allahu akbar, people are like, ‘We don’t know why he did it.’”

Some Muslims have become wary of saying the phrase, or speaking in Arabic in general, while in public. The feeling of anxiety is felt heavily on planes, where some have reported being taken off flights for speaking in Arabic.

Rashid said that as a result of how the phrase is treated in America, he tries to use it as much as possible around his children.

“I don’t want them to feel intimidated. I feel young Muslims feel intimidated using words like jihad, or Allahu akbar, or even saying ‘assalamu alaikum’ [a common greeting] in public,” he said. “It’s an unfortunate side effect of what’s happening right now.”

Burhaan Kinu via Getty Images Allahu akbar is said during prayer and also in everyday conversations -- as an expression of celebration.

Another side effect of misusing and misunderstanding Islamic phrases is that it leads to fears of a backlash against the Muslim community. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased dramatically since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Allahu akbar has been weaponized in the past by people whose intent is to harm Muslims. In Quebec City, Canada in January, it was reportedly yelled out by a suspect with far-right, white nationalist views during a deadly attack on a mosque community.

This summer, an Italian mayor threatened that anyone who shouts Allahu akbar in a main square in Venice would be immediately shot.

Ahmed, of MPAC, said she believes every terrorist act done in the name of Islam not only takes away innocent lives but also threatens the security of Americans who are Muslim.

“Because there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding about our faith and community, those who seek revenge for these attacks will usually direct their anger toward the first innocent Muslim they see on the streets, at school, and at public places,” she told HuffPost. “Since 9/11, this has been our reality. Whenever there is any terror incident done in our name, we mourn not only as Americans, but we mourn the hijacking of our faith and brace ourselves for potential backlash.”

That’s why Ahmed believes education about Islam is crucial. Instead of allowing the Islamic State to define what Allahu akbar means, she said it’s important to seek authentic, legitimate voices and interpretations of the phrase.",Here's What You Need To Know About The Phrase 'Allahu Akbar',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-phrase-allahu-akbar_us_59f9e067e4b0d1cf6e91f995

Erziehungsexperten versuchen Antworten darauf zu finden, warum inzwischen schon bei Grundschülern Burnout-Syndrome diagnostiziert werden und was eigentlich aus der Idee einer unbeschwerten Kindheit geworden ist.

Kaum jemand im deutschsprachigen Raum hat sich mit dem Thema Kindererziehung wohl so lange und lebensnah beschäftigt wie der Schweizer Kinderarzt Remo Largo.

Auch wenn sein erstes Buch “Babyjahre” schon fast zwei Jahrzehnte alt ist, gehört es noch immer zur Grundausstattung junger Eltern.

Viele Eltern wollen ihr Kind maximal fördern - auch über sein Potenzial hinaus

Seit mehr als 30 Jahren befasst sich der “bekannteste Kinderarzt der Schweiz” mit der kindlichen Entwicklung und dem Einfluss, den unsere Gesellschaft darauf hat.

Largo, der selbst Vater von drei Töchtern und auch lange schon Großvater ist, beobachtet ein entscheidendes Problem in der modernen Erziehung: Er ist der Ansicht, dass viele Eltern eine falsche Vorstellung davon haben, wie ihr Kind zu einem glücklichen, erfolgreichen Menschen heranwächst.

“Ein Kind ist darauf ausgelegt, sein Begabungspotenzial auszuschöpfen”, sagte er der HuffPost. “Doch in unserer Gesellschaft ist das für viele unglaublich schwer geworden.”

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt, was Kinder mehr als alles andere von ihren Eltern brauchen

Schuld sei ein Irrglaube, dem viele Eltern unterliegen. “Viele Eltern versuchen, ihr Kind über sein Begabungspotenzial hinaus zu fördern”, erklärt er. “Das ist aber nicht möglich.”

Die Folge: “Sie überfordern das Kind und verunsichern es.”

Eltern müssen die Grenzen ihrer Kinder akzeptieren

Largo zieht einen simplen Vergleich: “Jedes Kind ist verschieden groß. Wenn ein Kind zu wenig Nahrung bekommt, wird es kleiner. Wird es überfüttert, wird es nicht größer, sondern nur dick. So ist es auch mit den geistigen Fähigkeiten.”

So wie das körperliche Wachstum eines Kindes also limitiert ist, stößt es auch bei seinen Begabungen und Stärken an klare Grenzen.

(Das hat Largo übrigens zu Kindern zu sagen, die nicht gehorchen; der Text geht nach dem Video weiter:)

Ein Kinderarzt erklärt: Das ist der oft übersehene Grund, warum Kinder ihren Eltern nicht gehorchen





Eltern müssten erkennen und akzeptieren, dass ihr Kind in manchen Feldern besser sei als in anderen und dass es nichts bringe, die nicht so stark ausgeprägten Fähigkeiten ohne Rücksicht auf seine eigentlichen Bedürfnisse verbessern zu wollen, erklärt Largo.

Dass Eltern ihre Kinder über ihr Potenzial hinaus versuchen zu fördern, lässt sich laut Largo durch den gesellschaftlichen Druck erklären.

Zu viel Förderung führt nicht zu mehr Erfolg

Andere Eltern und Erzieher in der Kita setzten Maßstäbe, wie weit ein Kind in einem bestimmten Alter in seiner Entwicklung sein müsse. Und in der Schule gehe es weiter - mit starren Lehrplänen und oft unflexiblen Lehrern.

“Wenn das eigene Kind dann beispielsweise weniger gut lesen und rechnen kann, als es nach dieser Vorstellung sollte, löst das bei den meisten Eltern Ängste aus.”

Die Reaktion vieler Eltern: stärkere Förderung - auch dort, wo das Potenzial des Kindes bereits voll ausgeschöpft ist. Damit entstehe die Gefahr der Überlastung, warnt Largo.

“Eltern dürfen ihre Kinder nicht überfordern”, sagt er. “Die zunehmende Zahl der Burnout-Fälle selbst bei Kindern zeigt aber, dass viele Eltern genau das tun. Die Kinder wollen dann nicht mehr lernen, können nicht mehr schlafen, fühlen sich niedergeschlagen.”

Largos Rat: “Bemerken Eltern, dass sie ihr Kind überfordern, sollten sie sich selbst hinterfragen und sich ehrlich überlegen, weshalb sie solchen Druck machen.”

Viele Eltern machen sich selbst großen Druck

Die Ursache für ein solches Verhalten der Eltern, so Largos Erfahrung, sei nämlich in vielen Fällen gleich.

“Der Grund ist häufig die eigene existenzielle Verunsicherung der Eltern”, sagt er.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Das passiert mit Kindern, die früh in die Kita kommen

“Sie haben Angst, dass sie ihren Lebensstandard nicht halten können und fürchten, dass die Lebensqualität für ihre Kinder nicht mehr so hoch sein könnte wie bei ihnen. Sie versuchen deshalb, die Kinder extrem zu fördern - in dem Glauben, das mache die Kinder klüger und damit auch erfolgreicher. Doch das ist ein Irrglaube.”

Was sollten Eltern also anders machen? Largos Antwort darauf ist einfach.

Kinder müssten nicht die ganze Zeit beschäftigt und gefördert werden.

Eltern sollten ihre Kinder sinnvolle Erfahrungen machen lassen

“Eltern sollten Vertrauen haben in die Kinder”, sagt er. “Ihre Aufgabe ist nicht, die Kinder mit allen möglichen Dingen zu fördern, sondern ihnen sinnvolle Erfahrungen zu ermöglichen, zum Beispiel mit anderen Kindern.”

Dann, so erklärt er, werde das Kind auch Erfolg haben. “Denn es wählt das aus, was es für seine Entwicklung braucht und was es kann.”

Ohne diese Erfahrungen werde ein Kind verunsichert - und das habe laut Largo wiederum negative Auswirkungen auf sein Lernverhalten. Bei einer übermäßigen Förderung kann sich außerdem der gewünschte Effekt umkehren und das Kind stattdessen Lernschwierigkeiten entwickeln.

“Ein Neunjähriger ist dann beispielsweise beim Lesen auf dem Entwicklungsstand eines Siebenjährigen - obwohl seine Eltern genau das Gegenteil erreichen wollten - nämlich, dass er besser ist als die Anderen.”

Falsche Förderung führt zu einer Überforderung

Diese falsche Förderung führe zwangsläufig zu einer Überforderung in der Schule und diese wiederum zu Misserfolgen, warnt der Mediziner.

Die Folgen seien dramatisch: “Das Gefühl des Versagens zerstört das Selbstwertgefühl immer mehr, bis wir es mit einem zutiefst verunsicherten Erwachsenen zu tun haben, der sich nichts zutraut und Probleme hat, sich in der Berufswelt zurechtzufinden.”



Und damit ist Largo bei einer Botschaft angelangt, die er seit Jahrzehnten predigt - Kinder so nehmen, wie sie sind.



“Es ist deshalb wichtig zu akzeptieren, dass sich jedes Kind auf seine Weise und in seinem Tempo entwickeln will. Dazu gehört also anzuerkennen, dass jedes Kind anders ist.”



Eine Botschaft, die sich alle Eltern noch mehr zu Herzen nehmen sollten - auch wenn sie völlig selbstverständlich klingt.

Die Vorgeschichte dazu ist traurig. Vor wenigen Tagen starb Hannahs Mutter Peggy im Alter von 55 Jahren an Nierenkrebs. Sie hinterließ Hannah und ihren Geschwistern emotionale Briefe, in denen sie sich von jedem ihrer Kinder verabschiedete.

Obwohl sie zuerst mit sich haderte, veröffentlichte die junge Frau den Abschiedsbrief der Mutter in den sozialen Medien, um der Welt zu zeigen, “was für eine Person meine Mutter war. Sie war stets besorgter um andere als um sich selbst und war so eine großartige Mutter für alle ihre Kinder.”

In dem Brief an Hannah schrieb die Mutter demnach: “Es tut mir so leid. Ich habe versucht, diese furchtbare Krankheit zu überwinden, aber ich denke, Gott hatte andere Pläne für mich.”

""Ich bin immer noch genauso stolz auf dich, wie ich es immer war""

Mutter Peggy erinnerte ihre Tochter daran, dass sie noch viele Menschen in ihrem Leben habe, die sie lieben und mit denen sie in dieser schweren Zeit reden solle. Sie riet ihr, sich mit Menschen zu umgeben, die an die selben Dinge glauben. “Aber vergiss nicht, dass ich immer noch bei dir bin”, schrieb sie weiter. “Und ich bin immer noch genauso stolz auf dich, wie ich es immer war.”

Außerdem richtete sie auch Worte an ihre zukünftigen Enkelkinder. “Falls du eines Tages Kinder haben solltest, stelle sicher, dass sie wissen, wie sehr ich auch sie liebe und wie gerne ich sie kennengelernt hätte.”

Zum Schluss gab sie ihrer Tochter noch mit auf den Weg, jeden Tag zu leben, als wäre es ihr letzter. Man wisse nie, wann dieser sei.

Der HuffPost erzählte die 18-Jährige, dass es für sie sehr schwer war, den Brief zu lesen. Trotzdem habe sie sich getröstet gefühlt.

Sie hat eine wichtige Nachricht

Mit ihrem Tweet, der den Brief der Mutter beinhaltet, erreichte die Schülerin Hunderttausende Menschen und erhielt über 1000 Antworten.

An all diese Menschen hat Hannah eine wichtige Nachricht: “Nehmt das als Anlass eure Eltern heute etwas fester zu drücken. Seht sie nicht als selbstverständlich an. Denn wir wissen alle nicht, wie lange wir sie bei uns haben werden.”

“Game of Thrones” fans may shed a tear when HBO’s fantasy epic draws to a close following its eighth and final season, but the British actress says she’s eager for the show to end so that she can pursue other projects.

It’s “incredibly exciting” and “will be nice to pick roles that I want to do,” the 20-year-old told BBC Newsbeat in a piece published online Thursday.

“I can show the world what sort of actress I want to be and shape my career a little bit,” she added.

Williams has appeared as the sword-wielding, list-keeping Arya Stark since she was just 14. The actress acknowledged that the prospect of not having the show as a safety net was “nerve wracking.”

But “on the other hand,” Williams said she’ll be “free” and able to develop independent movies via her newly-launched production company.

CHENNAI -- Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Monday said that editorial freedom should be used in public interest and urged the newspapers to devote space to increase awareness about climate change.

Speaking at the 75th anniversary celebrations of Tamil newspaper Daily Thanthi at the Madras University Centenary Auditorium, Modi said lot of things happen around the world and the editors decide what is important to be published in their newspapers.

He said: ""Editorial freedom should be used wisely and in public interest.""

Pointing out the natural calamities occurring around the world at regular intervals, Modi urged newspapers to allocate space to increase awareness about climate change.

He said the freedom to write does not in anyway reduce the importance to be accurate and correct, adding that though media outlets may be owned by the private sector, they serve a public purpose, have much social accountability and their conduct should be above board.

He said technological advancement enables citizens to compare, discuss and analyse the credibility of news and the media should take extra caution to maintain its credibility.

According to him, reform in media can come from within and through introspection.

Observing most of the media discourse revolves around politics, Modi said the nation is made of over a billion people and the media should focus on the people and their achievements.

Citing the spread of mobile phones, Modi said citizen reporting is important in showcasing individual achievements and also helping in the aftermath of natural disasters.

Modi also released a souvenir.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of State for Finance and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan, Chief Minister K. Palaniswami and his deputy O.Pannerselvam also participated in the function.

Paying encomiums to the founder of Daily Thanthi S.P. Adithanar and his son Sivanthi Adithan, Palaniswami said the daily would certainly see centenary celebrations.

Leaders of several political parties, law makers, industrialists, movie actors and diplomats attended the function.

Earlier on his arrival Modi was received by Purohit, Palaniswami and others at the airport.

The international development secretary has also been reprimanded by Downing Street for her actions.
The BBC was the first to report on Friday that Patel had undisclosed meetings.

However Patel today admitted the foreign secretary “became aware of the visit” but “not in advance of it”.","Priti Patel has apologised for taking time out of a family holiday to meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians without telling the Foreign Office in advance.

The international development secretary has also been reprimanded by Downing Street for her actions.

Labour said Patel must either be investigated by the Cabinet Office or resign.

Patel was accompanied to nearly all of her meetings with Israeli ministers, charities and non-governmental organisations by honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel lobbying group, Lord Polak.

She apologised for setting up and reporting the meetings “in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures” and clarified her claim that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson “knew about the visit”, admitting he did not know about it in advance.

The BBC was the first to report on Friday that Patel had undisclosed meetings.

Patel said in a statement on Monday: “This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself.

“While away, I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations. I am publishing a list of who I met.‎ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was aware of my visit while it was under way‎.

“In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be misread, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it.

“My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world’s poor at the front of our development work.”

Downing Street said Theresa May had spoken to Patel and “accepted her apology for her handling of the matter”.

“The prime minister met the secretary of state this morning to remind her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code,” a No.10 spokesman said.

Downing Street also revealed May did not know about the meeting between Patel and Netanyahu until Friday.

Kate Osamor MP, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said: “Today’s statement is a desperate last-ditch attempt by Priti Patel to save her job. It has now emerged that, contrary to her statement on Friday, the Foreign Secretary was never told in advance about her meetings in Israel - which we have only now discovered included meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and with the Foreign Ministry.

“Not only does it look like she might have breached the Ministerial Code, she has now been caught misleading the British public. If she doesn’t now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation.”

Dfid has admitted that the statement Patel gave to The Guardian on November 3 could have left given the impression Johnson knew about her trip in advance.

“Boris knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip],” she told the newspaper.

However Patel today admitted the foreign secretary “became aware of the visit” but “not in advance of it”.

Dfid also had to acknowledge that Patel may have led people to believe all the meetings she had in Israel had already been publically reported - when they had not.

“The Secretary of State regrets the lack of precision in the wording she used in these statements, and is taking this opportunity to clarify the position,” Dfid said.

Ist man aber von Beruf Erzieherin, rate ich dringend davon ab.

So findet man nämlich dort Posts, in denen eine Mutter von ihrem erschütterten Vertrauen zu der Erzieherin ihres Sohnes berichtet, weil diese ihn im KiGa beim Essen für 2 Minuten vor die Tür gesetzt hat, da er sich dort angefangen hatte zu prügeln.

Das Kind wäre jetzt emotional total am Boden... Musste das Zimmer verlassen, bis die Erzieherin nach kam, um die Situation mit dem Kind in Ruhe zu klären. Sie fühle sich überhaupt nicht mehr wohl jetzt dort.

Muss man hier schon etwas schmunzeln, so liest man am besten nicht weiter, was andere Mütter darunter schreiben:

""Das ist verletzte Aufsichtspflicht! Dafür kannst du sie kündigen lassen!""

""Melde das dem Träger.""

""Erkundige dich beim Rechtsanwalt.""

""Vielleicht kann man den KiGa deshalb schließen lassen, frag mal bei Jugendamt nach.""

Ungelogen.

Alltag im Kindergarten

Ich habe mir also ein Herz gefasst und versucht zu erklären, wie eine Essenssituation im KiGa abläuft:

20 Kinder sitzen um einen Tisch und warten darauf, dass du jedem von Ihnen das Essen austeilst. Nebenbei rufen die ersten schon wieder nach was zu trinken, weil ihr Glas schon ausgetrunken ist. Ein kleineres Kind braucht Hilfe dabei, sein Fleisch zu schneiden.

Ein weiteres jammert darüber, dass ihm das Essen nicht schmeckt. Der Nebenmann schmeißt das Glas um, die Pfütze muss aufgewischt werden. Wieder leere Trinkgläser. Zwei Kinder streiten, weil einer eine Nudel vom Teller des anderen geklaut hat und die zwei daneben bewerfen sich giggelnd mit ihrem Essen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir Erzieher stehen jeden Tag kurz vor dem Burnout

So... Ist es da nicht vielleicht gar nicht soooooo unverständlich, dass das Kind kurz draußen warten soll, bis alle versorgt sind, damit die Erzieherin dann in Ruhe mit ihm sprechen kann um die Situation zu klären? Vor allem, wenn die Gruppentüre ein Glasfenster hat, um sehen zu können, was draußen vor sich geht?

Ich habe für diese Darstellung viele ""Likes"" bekommen, hauptsächlich von anderen Erzieherinnen. Von den anderen wurde meine Sicht der Dinge ignoriert. Ganz klar, sonst kann man sich ja nicht weiter aufregen.

Keine Ahnung von den Aufgaben der Erzieher

Nun könnte man meinen, dieses Phänomen tritt nur im Internet auf. Aber nein.

Zurück in der Arbeitswelt, kann ich nur noch Kopfschütteln. Und es wird mit jedem Jahr nur schlimmer... KiGa-Bashing, das neue Hobby vieler Eltern. Eine ganz neue Art des Mobbing ist geboren.

Als Erzieher ist es heutzutage kaum mehr möglich, sich auf die Bedürfnisse der Kinder zu konzentrieren, da einige Eltern ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse beim Personal an erster Stelle sehen.

Es ist nicht mehr möglich, überhaupt irgendetwas richtig zu machen, deshalb verbringt man gefühlte Stunden damit, sich morgens oder mittags vor Eltern im Flur zu rechtfertigen, warum dieses oder jenes so passiert ist.

So kommt zum Beispiel eine Mutter mit der Beschwerde, man habe ihr am Vortag nicht gesagt, dass ihr Kind im Flur beim Anziehen Streit angefangen habe. Sie möchte so etwas aber bitte dringend immer sofort mitgeteilt bekommen, denn schließlich möchte sie dann mit ihrem Kind darüber reden können, dass man so etwas nicht tut.

Ok... das ist jetzt zum Beispiel eine der Aufgaben, die ein Erzieher eigentlich hat: Hilfe bei der Konfliktlösung. Vielleicht habe das aber auch bloß ich falsch verstanden.

Jedenfalls wird bei dieser Beschwerde und gleichzeitigen Bitte anscheinend übersehen, dass wir nicht nur ein Kind betreuen. Und bei einer Gruppe von 20 Kindern würde es ziemlich viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen, jeder Mutter beim Abholen einen Bericht darüber zu erstatten, wann ihr Kind sich gestritten hat. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: Kinder streiten ständig!

Auch kommt es manchmal vor, dass ein Kind dabei ausholt, und dem andern Kind ""eine scheppert"". Natürlich greifen wir Erzieher dann ein (selten schaffen wir das, bevor es ""klatsch"" gemacht hat, wir sind Menschen, keine Fantasyfiguren mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit), erklären, dass man dem andern nicht weh tun darf und zeigen alternative Handlungsmöglichkeiten auf.

Wir überprüfen, ob sich der andere weh getan hat, reichen Kühlbeutel und Kügelchen.

Beim Abholen werden Eltern von ""Täter"" und ""Opfer"" informiert, damit sie Bescheid wissen, falls Ihre Kinder daheim davon erzählen. Passt, oder? Nein, passt nicht.

Drohungen und Beleidigungen gegen das Personal

Greift ein Kind noch zwei mal öfter darauf zurück, sich körperlich zu wehren oder zu äußern, gibt es schon nach kürzester Zeit die lautstarke Forderung von Eltern, dieses Kind dem Jugendamt zu melden.

Es wird von einer Gefahrenlage im Kindergarten gesprochen. Ja, es wird sogar der Kindergarten gewechselt. Weil das ja sonst nirgends vorkommt oder toleriert wird! Nur hier ist das so.

Dass es sich hierbei um Kinder handelt, die zwei Minuten nach ihrem Streit wieder miteinander spielen und keiner dabei verletzt wurde, vergessen die Eltern hierbei leider komplett.

Natürlich gibt es auch Kinder, die tatsächlich Bedürfnisse haben, die ihr derzeitiger Kindergarten nicht erfüllen kann. Je nachdem worum es dabei geht, und vor allem, wenn so viel ""körperliches Verhalten"" im Spiel ist, kann man den Eltern dann also höflich ans Herz legen, dass heilpädagogisch geschultes Personal ihrem Kind besser dabei helfen kann, seine Konflikte zu bewältigen.

Dabei lässt man dann ganz bewusst weg, dass ihr Kind nicht aufgrund von Hochbegabung ""unterfordert"" ist, wie von den Eltern geschildert, sondern das Problem wo anders liegt.

Wenn's so einfach denn wäre... Nein.

""Was für ein unfähiges Personal kommt jetzt nicht mit meinem Kind zurecht? Dieser Kindergarten ist das Allerletzte! Andere müssen vor euch gewarnt werden!""

Wenn man dann als privater Kindergarten auch noch das Recht hat, den Betreuungsvertrag zu kündigen, weil man mit den Eltern zusammen im Gespräch nicht weiter kommt und sich angemessene Hilfe für das Kind wünscht (und andere Eltern berechtigterweise schon mit dem Jugendamt drohen) erreicht der Frust dieser Eltern ganz neue Dimensionen.

Drohungen, den Kindergarten bei der Familienministerin zu melden. Beim Landesjugendamt über das unfähige Personal informieren wollen.

Ja, solche Drohungen gehören mittlerweile zum Alltag eines Erziehers.

Erzieher sollen sich aber ganz selbstverständlich beißen lassen, wenn man versucht, das Kind zu beruhigen. Immerhin sind wir ja selber schuld, unfähig wie wir sind.

Organisierte Elternbanden

Man könnte jetzt sagen: Ok, vielleicht ist das ein Problem der privaten Einrichtungen. Aber nein! Die Kollegin aus dem Regelkindergarten erzählt, dass sie einen Papa im Garten neulich fragte, warum er mit seinem Handy Fotos der dort zum Spielen vorhandenen Fahrräder macht.

Sie wurde dann darüber aufgeklärt, dass sein Kind sich an einem Fahrrad in den Finger geschnitten hat. Drei Tage später kam ein Brief vom Rechtsanwalt der gegen den Kindergarten klagt, weil bei einem Fahrrad am Lenker der Gummigriff fehlte und sich das Kind dort verletzt habe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eltern: Hört auf, eure Kinder zu verweichlichten Menschen zu erziehen

Oder aber organisierte Elternbanden, die sich beim Bürgermeister beschweren, weil der Kindergarten sich pädagogisch begründet weigert, das Vorschulprogramm nach den Vorstellungen einzelner Eltern für alle zu erweitern.

Wenn ich also morgens aufstehe und mich für die Arbeit fertig mache denke ich mir nicht: Oh ja, heute backe ich Kuchen mit den Kids! Sondern: Mal sehen, was mich heute wieder davon abhält, Kuchen mit den Kids zu backen.

Die traurige Wahrheit ist: Die ganze Zeit, die wir damit verbringen, uns mit solchen Dingen herumzuschlagen, verbringen wir eben nicht bei den Kindern.

Aber liebe Eltern, was glaubt ihr denn, wem ihr hier eure Kinder anvertraut? Sind wir auf das viele Geld aus, dass man als Erzieher verdient? Bekommt man einen Erzieherabschluss durchs Beantworten von Multiple-Choice-Fragen im Internet?

Wir wollen für eure Kinder da sein

Erzieher sind Menschen, die es sich zum Beruf gemacht haben, für eure Kinder da zu sein. Wir wollen sie umsorgen, ihnen etwas beibringen und ihnen einen geborgenen Raum für ihre Entwicklung schaffen.

Die ganze Negativität, die tagtäglich über das ""Nichts-recht-machen-können"" in unseren Gruppenalltag eindringt, verstört Kinder und Personal.

Wir opfern unsere Freizeit, um Spielzeug für Eure Kinder zu basteln, um Feste vorzubereiten und um uns Beschäftigungen mit Lerneffekt auszudenken.

Die geopferte Freizeit wird aber mit jedem mal Drama etwas weniger. Denn ganz ehrlich: Wer hat schon Lust, sich unbezahlt Gedanken über die Arbeit zu machen, wenn man als Dank dafür schlecht gemacht wird und sich beleidigen lassen muss?

Liebe besagte Eltern, seht ihr nicht, dass ihr höchstpersönlich dafür sorgt, dass die Qualität schlechter und die Geduld weniger wird, die wir gerne für eure Kinder übrig hätten?

Jedem, der sich in diesen Beispielen mit ähnlichem Verhalten wiedererkennt, möchte ich sagen:

Ihr seid die Tyrannen, die ihren Anteil am Personalnotstand der Kindergärten haben.

Wer möchte schon freiwillig unter solchen Umständen arbeiten?!

Es gibt sie noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern

Abschließend möchte ich aber dringend betonen: Es gibt sie natürlich noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern!

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens nicht aufstehe, um mir zu überlegen, wie ich sie ärgern kann oder ihr Kind negativ in seiner Entwicklung beeinflussen kann.

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens aufstehe, weil ich ihre Kinder liebe, und nur das Beste für die mir anvertrauten kleinen Menschen will.

Die Eltern, die ""Danke"" sagen.

Die Eltern, die mir nicht sofort böse Absicht unterstellen, wenn tatsächlich mal ein Fehler passiert.

Die Eltern, die zu vernünftigen Gesprächen bereit sind, wenn es ein Problem gibt.

Bitte, liebe ""normale"" Eltern! Ihr müsst endlich lauter sein als die Dauer-Motzer und Drama-Verursacher! Damit wir weiterhin wissen, warum wir morgens aufstehen und nicht irgendwann resignieren.

A mediados de los años sesenta, una petrolera perforó grandes pozas en la selva amazónica de Ecuador donde arrojó petróleo de prueba y residuos tóxicos, sin importar que esa práctica fuera dañina. Pasaron 26 años y la empresa se retiró dejando un ecosistema devastado y cerca de mil ""piscinas"" que, cuatro décadas después, siguen filtrando sustancias tóxicas y contaminando las aguas subterráneas. Aunque ha habido diversos juicios contra la empresa, la contaminación provocada por Texaco-Chevron permanece impune a la fecha.

En México, hace tres años, la minera Buenavista del Cobre, filial de Grupo México, contaminó los ríos Sonora y Bacánuchi con más de 40 mil metros cúbicos de ácido de sulfato de cobre, afectando de forma directa a 22 mil personas que viven en los siete municipios situados a orillas del río Sonora, dañando su salud y mermando la productividad de la región. A pesar de los exhortos de Naciones Unidas para que el gobierno mexicano atienda este caso, hasta hoy las autoridades no han castigado a ningún responsable del peor desastre ambiental de la minería en el país.

Situaciones como estas, donde las empresas siguen operando sin problemas, a pesar de haber violentado los derechos de miles o millones de personas, podrían evitarse en el futuro con la existencia de un tratado internacional que las obligue a responder por sus actos.

Esta iniciativa de Tratado Vinculante, ha sido impulsada a nivel mundial por cientos de agrupaciones civiles que llevan más de una década organizándose para llegar a este momento. Más de 200 se hicieron presentes en Ginebra del 23 al 27 de octubre, a fin de impulsar este instrumento diseñado especialmente para frenar los abusos de las grandes corporaciones.

Fue una semana histórica en muchos sentidos, pero sobre todo porque marcó el inicio de la creación de un documento que, de concretarse, proveerá los mecanismos jurídicos necesarios para que las grandes empresas trasnacionales estén obligadas a respetar los derechos humanos y, en consecuencia, quienes han visto violados sus derechos por parte de esas empresas puedan acceder a la justicia y a la remediación.

Y precisamente el acceso a la justicia y a remediar el daño constituyen el centro del debate entre grupos empresariales, representantes de los Estados y asociaciones civiles, pues las empresas argumentan que no se requiere un Tratado Vinculante, sino que basta con cumplir con regulaciones voluntarias como los Principios Rectores sobre las Empresas y los Derechos Humanos que Naciones Unidas aprobó en 2011.

No obstante, como ha señalado Surya Deva, integrante del Grupo de Trabajo de Naciones Unidas sobre Empresas y Derechos Humanos, sin un Tratado Vinculante nunca podremos garantizar el acceso al remedio, porque las violaciones a derechos humanos por parte de las empresas suceden cada vez más en otros países, y si no contamos con una cadena de jurisdicción y de responsabilidad de los Estados a nivel transnacional, las empresas siempre podrán evadir la justicia. No hay ningún motivo para pensar que la implementación de los principios rectores y el desarrollo de un tratado de este tipo no sean procesos complementarios.

La discusión estuvo a cargo del Grupo de Trabajo Intergubernamental de Composición Abierta, especialmente generado para desarrollar el Tratado Vinculante sobre derechos humanos, empresas transnacionales y otras empresas (GTI), liderado por Ecuador con apoyo de Sudáfrica. En las sesiones participaron los estados miembro de la ONU (México incluido), así como agrupaciones empresariales como la International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), la International Organisation of Employees (IOE) y, por supuesto, numerosas organizaciones de la sociedad civil.

A pesar de que las negociaciones iniciaron con críticas a la propuesta hecha por Ecuador (principalmente por la falta de tiempo para consultar al interior de los gobiernos y porque el documento necesita trabajar mejor el sustento jurídico), lo cierto es que al final de la semana se logró un acuerdo sobre los principales temas que debería abordar un tratado de esta naturaleza, y los Estados participantes lograron involucrarse en un debate técnico sobre el contenido para generar este instrumento.

Al término de las discusiones, el pleno acordó que Ecuador deberá definir en breve una hoja de ruta para llegar con un borrador enriquecido para la siguiente sesión del Grupo de Trabajo que se dará en 2018.

Como era de esperarse, las agrupaciones empresariales insistieron en que no son sujetos obligados frente a los derechos humanos, sino que son sólo los Estados quienes deben garantizar su respeto. No obstante, la responsabilidad corporativa frente a los derechos humanos no aumenta ni disminuye si el Estado cumple o no su deber de proteger los derechos humanos, como bien ha señalado John Ruggie, creador de los Principios Rectores de Empresas y Derechos Humanos.

En este punto cabe señalar que, aunque el Tratado Vinculante busca frenar los abusos de las grandes empresas, también permite atacar la captura corporativa del Estado, la cual sucede cuando una élite económica se apropia de la política y la economía nacional para beneficio propio y, como resultado, el estado de derecho falla al obligar a las empresas a rendir cuentas.

Las organizaciones civiles que participaron en la creación de este tratado, entre ellas PODER, ven con optimismo los avances logrados y se mantienen alerta sobre las posibles amenazas contra un instrumento de este tipo. Señalan, por ejemplo la intención de algunos países de la Unión Europea, de cuestionar el mandato de Ecuador dentro del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU en marzo de 2018 para que no se llegue a discutir un nuevo borrador del documento.

Para algunos Estados y la sociedad civil que participa en este proceso, no hay duda de que el mandato del Grupo Intergubernamental de Trabajo ha sido claro desde el inicio de este proceso, y es un mandato que sigue abierto hasta que se genere el Tratado Vinculante. Por ello, confian en que el mandato del Grupo de Trabajo se mantendrá como está y que Ecuador seguirá acompañando el proceso hasta llevarlo a buen puerto. Confian, además, en que los Estados participantes seguirán sumándose para aportar de forma proactiva a este proceso.

Lo que llevó a todas y todos quienes estuvieron en Ginebra fue el consenso de que las empresas transnacionales tienen la obligación de respetar los derechos humanos, y que estas no pueden, ni deben, ser más fuertes que los Estados donde operan.

South Africa stands at a crossroad in a number of areas, including meaningful land reform.","Koos Mthimkhulu inspects his crop at his farm in Senekal, about 287km from Johannesburg in the eastern Free State, in this February 29, 2012, file photo. South Africa's plans to undo the wrongs of apartheid by returning land seized from native blacks is embodied in the life of Mthimkhulu.

There is little doubt that land reform is one the most pressing issues facing our country. From the pronouncements of politicians to government policy to social media commentary, everyone is talking about land. And with good reason.

It impacts directly on a critical sector of our economy that employs some 850,000 people, and contributes about 2.5 percent to the country's GDP as well as towards food security. Over and above this, the agri-business sector, which ensures primary products reach our shelves and pantries, is a substantive employer and country revenue earner. Estimates are that the agriculture sector's total economic contribution to the multiplier effect is at about 28 percent.

South Africa remains saddled with massive inequity inherited from centuries of colonialism and apartheid exploitation. We cannot continue with a situation where some 70 percent of productive farmland in the country is owned by the minority white population. The frustration and anger of the landless are clear, not to mention the poverty, unemployment and hopelessness of the rural dispossessed. A workable land reform solution must be found.

Various land reform programmes have been implemented over the past 23 years, with some R50-billion invested into a number of programmes, such as the Settlement/Land Acquisition Grant (SLAG), Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD), the Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS), Land Acquisition for Sustainable Development (LASD), the Recapitalisation and Development Grant (RDG), and the Comprehensive Agriculture Support Programme (CASP).

A 2016 report by the Financial and Fiscal Commission reviewing land reform confirms that land reform initiatives have failed to achieve their objectives.

It attributed this to:

The state being torn between equity and economic development considerations, resulting in a tension between promoting pro-poor land reform and encouraging larger-scale commercial agriculture.

State subsidies to alleviate farming risk discouraging beneficiaries from investing and learning the skills needed to farm successfully.

Remote decision-making on support programmes by non-agricultural skilled officials slowing down the process.

Leasing farms to beneficiaries, leaving them without assets to borrow against so that they can develop and work their farms.

A lack of support and upskilling to ensure that beneficiaries can effectively translate their presence on the land into operational and developmental success.

Should the agricultural property be ""expropriated without compensation"" both private sector financiers and the state-owned enterprise (that is the Land Bank) would be adversely affected.

The Banking Association South Africa firmly supports the need for more effective land reform and the orderly re-distribution of commercial farms to Black beneficiaries. At the same time, we must ensure that it does not increase the plight of the poor either, as a result of job losses or -- more importantly -- increased levels of food insecurity, caused by the collapse of food production. If this were to happen, we would all suffer, but the the poor, whom we are hoping will benefit from land reform, would be most affected.

Also, such policy should not place the country's financial system at risk. Hence the policy of ""expropriation without compensation"" that is mooted in some quarters is worth unpacking.

For most individuals, property (either a home or a farm) is the biggest investment they will ever make in their lives. In turn, it is also an attractive asset class against which they are able to raise credit, which can then be used for further investment into their lives or businesses. For better or worse, credit drives much of the South African economy. This credit is primarily provided by the country's commercial banks, using money sourced from deposits which the public place with commercial banks -- for example, in the form of their salaries, savings and so forth.

Commercial banks, therefore, have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that when they make loans from these deposits, they do so without placing depositors like you and me at undue risk. This requires loans to be paid back by borrowers. The problem arises when the property no longer serves as an attractive collateral, as lenders will not be able to recover the debt from the collateral provided, which would result in losses being experienced by lenders. If these losses become severe enough, they could even cause the collapse of the lender.

The commercial agriculture sector has capital assets -- in other words, land and fixed improvements -- valued at about R208-billion, about R61-billion worth of machinery and vehicles/implements, and about R124-billion worth of livestock/produce. Against these assets, the R166-billion the primary agriculture sector gets in loans is broken down as follows: from commercial banks, about R112-billion, from the Land Bank, approximately R38-billion, from agricultural co-operatives, approximately R10-billion, and from other lenders/investors, approximately R6-billion.

Should agricultural property be ""expropriated without compensation"", both private-sector financiers and the state-owned enterprise (the Land Bank) would be adversely affected, as these loans would not have the necessary collateral to support them. This would in turn force lenders to review their loan portfolios and resort to the courts to recover as much of their debt as is possible.

South Africa stands at a crossroad in a number of areas, including meaningful land reform.

Also, lenders may seek to withdraw from providing any further loans to the agricultural sector, with dire consequences for employment, the economy and food security -- already, 25 percent of our population are food insecure, with 5 percent of our poor experiencing hunger.

Whilst commercial banks would be able to absorb the initial losses caused by ""expropriation without compensation"", the resultant secondary shocks to the South African economy in the forms of investor flight (both international and local), the further downgrade of South Africa and commercial bank international credit ratings, the plight of companies registered on the stock exchange whose business models are agriculture-related, and the negative impact on pension funds would be catastrophic. And that is before we consider the impact this will have on both employment and the poor.

While it may be argued that ""expropriation without compensation"" would impact only a minority of commercial farms, many in the value chain would ask: ""Who is next?'. Investors would also be concerned that ""expropriation without compensation"" would migrate into other asset classes -- such as residential or commercial property.

What is the way forward? We all have to acknowledge that we are in this together. The fortunes of business, labour, civil society and government are all intertwined. Key private-sector stakeholders, including financiers, recognise their responsibility and the important role they play in helping to shape a just and equitable future for our country.

BASA, in collaboration with the Agricultural Business Chamber and other stakeholders such as AgriSA, have developed financing models premised on a partnership with government that will realise the transformational target within the National Development Plan of transferring an additional 20 percent of commercial agriculture properties to Black beneficiaries by 2030.

These models are underpinned by developmental support, including mentoring and upskilling, that will have to be provided to the new farmers -- there is no debating the principle that unproductive land is of no value to beneficiaries nor for food security.

This represents meaningful land reform, where such Black beneficiaries receive title to their land, failing which they would not be able to use their newly acquired asset to borrow money from financiers for improvements or for production purposes.

South Africa stands at a crossroad in a number of areas, including meaningful land reform. Our hope is that the heavy burden that rests on the shoulders of policymakers sees decisions made in a responsible and informed manner, to reverse the current economic and social plight of our citizens, and in particular our poor.

Così Matteo Richetti, portavoce del Pd, risponde a chi gli chiede di commentare la scelta di Luigi Di Maio di cancellare il confronto tv con Matteo Renzi.","Prime conseguenze del voto siciliano. A meno di 24 ore dalla chiusura delle urne sull'isola, il leader del M5s Luigi Di Maio cancella il confronto tv con Matteo Renzi, previsto domani martedì 7 novembre in diretta su la7: ""Avevo chiesto il confronto qualche giorno fa - scrive su fb - quando lui era il candidato premier di quella parte politica. Il terremoto del voto in Sicilia ha completamente cambiato questa prospettiva. Mi confronterò con la persona che sarà indicata come candidato premier da quel partito o quella coalizione"".

Marcia indietro evidente che ha subito innescato la reazione dell'avversario. Luigi Di Maio mi ha sfidato a un confronto televisivo. ""Ha scelto la data, dopo il 5 novembre. Ha scelto la rete TV, La7. Ha scelto il conduttore, Floris. Ha fatto tutto lui"", scrive Renzi su Facebook. ""Io ho semplicemente accettato perché Di Maio è il leader del Movimento 5 stelle che in tutti i sondaggi se la batte con il Pd per il primo posto nel proporzionale. E siccome due milioni di italiani mi hanno chiesto sei mesi fa di guidare il Pd, ho pensato fosse un gesto di rispetto accettare un confronto pubblico e trasparente davanti agli italiani. Mi sembra un modo giusto e onesto di far politica. Oggi Di Maio scappa"". E poi continua:

Da giorni sapevamo che stavano litigando al loro interno dopo i precipitosi tweet dell'onorevole campano. Che avevano paura. Ma non credevamo che arrivassero al punto di fuggire così. Mi spiace. Da padre prima che da politico. Di Maio potrebbe essere il nuovo presidente del consiglio, se vinceranno loro. Mi spiace per i miei figli pensare che gli italiani rischino di essere guidati da un leader che è senza coraggio. Che ha paura di confrontarsi. Che inventa scuse ridicole. Chi è il leader del Pd lo decidono le primarie, cioè la democrazia interna. Non lo decidono le correnti, non lo decide il software di un'azienda privata, non lo decide Di Maio. Lo decide un popolo meraviglioso che viene ogni giorno insultato sul web da profili falsi e odiatori veri. La loro fuga nasce dalla paura, tutto qui. Avevo preso l'impegno con Giovanni Floris di partecipare a questa trasmissione. Io ci sarò, lo stesso. E risponderemo su tutto, dalla Sicilia alle tasse, dai vaccini alle banche, dall'economia alla politica estera. So di giocare in trasferta. Ma un leader che vuole governare l'Italia deve far fronte a enormi sfide: terrorismo internazionale, sicurezza globale, disoccupazione, lotta alla corruzione. Se un leader che vuole governare l'Italia con queste sfide ha paura di uno studio televisivo, semplicemente non è un leader. A domani, alle 21.30, su La7: se Di Maio ha un sussulto di dignità lo aspettiamo in studio. Altrimenti faremo con i giornalisti.

Nello suo post il leader M5s commenta anche il risultato del voto, sia in Sicilia che ad Ostia, dove il Movimento 5 stelle è al ballottaggio con il centrodestra: ""Vorrei fare - scrive - alcune considerazioni sulle due votazioni di ieri. Ad Ostia ci siamo confermati la prima forza politica con il 30%. In Sicilia abbiamo quasi triplicato il Pd e doppiato forza Italia. Sono insieme a Giancarlo e stiamo seguendo lo spoglio: il risultato sarà incerto fino all'ultimo seggio scrutinato. Possiamo farcela, ma lo sapremo solo alla chiusura dei seggi"".

Meloni: ""Vado io al confronto con Di Maio""

""La prima reazione di Luigi Di Maio è stata di rifiutare il confronto con Matteo Renzi. Trovo molto divertente che per domani era previsto un confronto tra M5stelle e Partito democratico per commentare la vittoria del centrodestra. Visto che Di Maio dice che vuol confrontarsi con chi vince, gli propongono di confrontarmi io domani con lui"". Lo ha detto Giorgia Meloni, leader di FdI-An, a Catania, al comitato elettorale di Nello Musumeci.

Video - Di Maio cancella il dibattito: le reazioni della rete

Sarà Alessandro Di Battista, a quanto si apprende da fonti M5S, ad andare in tv a diMartedì al posto di Di Maio. Le stesse fonti sottolineano come quello tra Di Battista e Renzi non sarà un faccia a faccia ma un un ""confronto indiretto"" in cui i due saranno intervistati separatamente e in due momenti diversi.

Alessandro Di Battista sarà a Di Martedì il 14 novembre e non domani, come inizialmente trapelato dopo l'annuncio di Di Maio del forfait al confronto con Renzi.

La reazione immediata del Pd ""E' talmente ridicolo che ogni commento rovinerebbe questa commedia"". Così Matteo Richetti, portavoce del Pd, risponde a chi gli chiede di commentare la scelta di Luigi Di Maio di cancellare il confronto tv con Matteo Renzi.

To make the situation even more high-stress for the former Yankee slugger, the friend in question was none other than current girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez.

In a new interview with Vanity Fair, A-Rod and J.Lo ― aka J-Rod ― discuss their first date at the Hotel Bel-Air last winter. Apparently, the pair had run into each other in Beverly Hills and hours later, Rodriguez gave Lopez a call.

They agreed to dinner, which J.Lo was certain meant a date, but A-Rod was not so sure.

“Maybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule,” Rodriguez tells the magazine. “I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.”

When Lopez told Rodriguez mid-date that she was single, he was so overwhelmed that he excused himself to go to the bathroom, where he proceeded to write her a text. A sexy text ― a sext, even.

The couple’s play-by-by of what happened next is pretty amazing:

“She told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,” Rodriguez says. “I had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.” “So I’m sitting there and he’s walking back, and I get a text,” Lopez continues. “It says . . . ” She looks significantly at Rodriguez. “You can tell her!” he says. “‘You look sexy AF,’” she tells me. They both laugh. “And then it took a turn,” Lopez says. “The fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.” I laugh, thinking she’s being metaphorical. “No, really,” she says. “The fire alarm went off!”

Après ""Un voyage inattendu"" et ""La désolation de Smaug"", ce volet referme -temporairement?- le travail d'adaptation de l'œuvre de J R.R. Tolkien par Peter Jackson. Et c'est une nouvelle que les spectateurs peuvent accueillir avec un certain soulagement.

La trilogie du Hobbit est celle qui contient le plus de défauts. Dès son élaboration, elle avait rencontré une série d'obstacles: un studio qui détient la moitié des droits, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), un temps au bord de la faillite, une grève des syndicats des acteurs en Nouvelle-Zélande et un changement de mains derrière la caméra.

D'abord confié aux soins du réalisateur mexicain Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"", ""Pacific Rim""), le triptyque n'avait finalement pas quitté le giron de Peter Jackson, ravi de profiter d'un nouveau canevas sur lequel son amour des nouvelles technologies -3D et 48 images par seconde- pouvait s'exprimer.

Bande-annonce du Hobbit: la bataille des cinq armées:

Le succès économique du ""Hobbit"" et en particulier du dernier opus ne fait pas de doute. Il devrait protéger le cinéaste néo-zélandais des critiques mitigées qui ont accueilli la sortie des deux premiers films.

Mais ""La bataille des cinq armées"" ne dérogeant pas à cette impression générale un peu brouillonne, on est en droit de se demander si Peter Jackson n'a pas signé la trilogie de trop.

Disproportions

Tous les observateurs s'accordent à dire que la matière première du Hobbit -un livre qui tourne autour de 300 pages selon différentes éditions- ne permettait qu'une adaptation cinématographique unique: un long métrage introduisant les trois films du ""Seigneur des anneaux"" sortis entre 2001 et 2003.

Peter Jackson convainc même la MGM et Warner Bros de transformer le diptyque prévu en trilogie. De la même manière que les franchises ""Harry Potter"", ""Twilight"" ou ""Hunger Games"", le dernier chapitre est alors divisé en deux parties. ""Nous avons le droit d'utiliser 125 pages de notes additionnelles dans lesquelles J R.R. Tolkien étend le monde du Hobbit"" justifiait le réalisateur lors d'une conférence de presse en 2012.

Cette décision ubuesque en terme de récit peut expliquer le déséquilibre de la trilogie. Le poids émotionnel et financier repose entièrement sur un dernier opus qui, malgré tous les efforts de Peter Jackson et son équipe, laisse un sentiment mitigé. ""La bataille des cinq armées"" dénote aussi par rapport aux deux premiers opus qui tentaient de capter une génération plus jeune de spectateurs.

Les aventures de Bilbon Sacquet, de la Comté au Mont Solitaire, ont toujours été considérées comme plus accessibles que le voyage suicidaire de son neveu Frodon vers le Mordor. Une partie des reproches faits à Peter Jackson après la sortie du ""Voyage inattendu"" ressemblaient d'ailleurs à ceux adressés à George Lucas lors de la sortie de ""La Menace Fantôme"".

Enjeu économique

En Terre du Milieu, MGM et la Warner Bros se sont d'abord frotté les mains. La trilogie du ""Seigneur des anneaux"" est un énorme succès financier et rapporte aux studios plus de 3 milliards de dollars de recette à travers le monde. Pour garantir les entrées en salles, il suffit de capitaliser sur le reste de la bibliographie de J R.R. Tolkien et laisser une liberté artistique totale à Peter Jackson.

""Un voyage inattendu"", premier opus de cette nouvelle trilogie, confirme la formule et cartonne pour sa sortie en décembre 2012 avec 1 milliard de dollars au box-office mondial. Trois records tombent: meilleur jour de démarrage pour un mois de décembre, meilleur week-end de démarrage de décembre et meilleur démarrage de la franchise ""Seigneur des Anneaux"".

L'enjeu était de taille puisque la franchise, comme le soulignait Variety, aura coûté aux studios presque le double de la première trilogie (561 millions de dollars contre 281, sans compter les dépenses en marketing).

266 jours de tournage en Nouvelle-Zélande devenue une destination touristique incontournable. En modifiant la législation du travail pour mettre fin à la grève des acteurs, le pays s'est même plié en quatre pour soutenir la saga qu'on retrouve dans des spots publicitaires pour la compagnie aérienne Air New Zealand.

Elijah Wood, Peter Jackson et un orque portant un masque à oxygène:

Symbole de ses enjeux, la Warner attaquera même les frères Weinstein (qui détiennent 2,5% particulièrement lucratif des droits de la franchise) pour plagiat, comme frappée par la maladie du dragon qui dévore le Roi sous la Montagne, Thorin, le poussant à sacrifier amitié et honneur dans sa défense du trésor et la recherche de l'Arkenstone.

Épique mais indigeste

Il est presque impossible de ne pas ressortir sonné de ""La bataille des cinq armées"". Tous les habitants de la Terre du Milieu se sont donné rendez-vous au pieds d'Erebor. Orques, trolls utilisés comme bélier, nains chevauchant des cochons sauvages, aigles ou chauve-souris géantes et elfes fendant des légions de gobelins sur le dos d'un élan que n'aurait pas renié Hayao Miyazaki.

""Les spectateurs ont tendance à oublier ce qui se passe à la fin du Hobbit. Il pensent que c'est un livre pour enfant mais c'est plutôt assez intense"", rappelait la co-scénariste Philippa Boyens à USA Today. Superproduction épique, ""La bataille des cinq armées"" contient plus d'une demi-heure de combat en images de synthèse. Une gageure.

La méthode de Peter Jackson a fait ses preuves. En 2004, le dernier volet du ""Seigneur des anneaux, Le retour du roi"", remporte onze Oscars dans chacune des catégories pour lesquelles il était nommé, égalant ""Ben-Hur"" et ""Titanic"". Mais le réalisateur semble avoir perdu sa science chirurgicale.

Viggo Mortensen, qui incarne Aragorn dans la première trilogie, avait critiqué l'utilisation du CGI (images de synthèse) dans une longue interview donnée au Telegraph, revenant sur l'expérience d'un tournage avec Jackson et son utilisation des nouvelles technologies. ""Peter Jackson a toujours été un 'geek' en matière de technologie. Une fois qu'il pouvait utiliser certains outils, il ne revenait plus jamais en arrière.""

""Dans le premier film, La Communauté de l'anneau, Rivendell et le Mordor sont en partie reproduits en images de synthèse mais ils ont une qualité presque organique, un grain réaliste. Les acteur jouent parfois dans de vrais paysages. Le deuxième film l'est déjà moins à mon goût et il n'y a que des effets spéciaux dans le troisième. C'est grandiose, mais tout ce qui est subtil dans le premier film se perd dans les suivants. Avec les deux premiers Hobbit, c'est ce phénomène puissance 10.""

Boucle

""Sans coopération de la Fondation Tolkien, il ne peut pas y avoir de nouveaux films"". En ajoutant des passerelles vers la trilogie du Seigneur des anneaux -notamment Legolas, interprété par Orlando Bloom, absent du livre- Peter Jackson referme la boucle et se garantit de nouvelles éditions DVDs réunissant les deux trilogies. En attendant de se laisser peut-être tenter par d'autres textes de l'auteur britannique comme Le Silmarillion.

""Les droits d'adaptation du Seigneur des anneaux et du Hobbit avaient été vendus par Tolkien à la fin des années soixante, ce sont ses seules œuvres qui aient jamais été vendues"", expliquait le réalisateur, précisant que les droits concernant les autres écrits de J.R.R. Tolkien étaient détenus par la Fondation Tolkien qui gère la succession de l'auteur britannique.

Move over Roger, Rover and Jack, make way for brand Made in India.

In a first, the Indian army is planning to induct the homebred Mudhol hound into the defence forces, apart from the familiar foreign breeds, like German Shepherds, Labradors and Great Swiss Mountain.

As the Hindu reported, the Mudhol, a cross between Persian and Turkish dogs, was peculiar to the region of Bagalkot in Karnataka, bred by the Ghorpade kings. These lanky creatures are known for their stamina and fighting spirit. They also have, reputedly, sharper and quicker reflexes than their foreign counterparts.

A bunch of these potential candidates are being trained at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) centre in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, while six dogs are already ready to join the forces in Jammu & Kashmir later this year.

RVC personnel have asked the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU) for a second batch of eight pups, The Hindu added.
