Sudan has suffered both from the sanctions and from the secession of the south in 2011, when it lost three-quarters of its oil output, its main source of foreign currency.

Now, Khartoum businessmen say they have begun closing deals with U.S. companies, and President Omar al-Bashir began a trip to Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia this week, seeking new markets for Sudanese exports and Arab investment in Sudan.

“We expect the sanctions decision to increase Sudan’s agricultural and animal exports by 25 percent by the end of the coming year,” said Wagdy Merghany, head of the Sudanese Exporters Union. “The lifting of the sanctions opens up new markets for Sudanese exports.”

The central bank has also started pushing Sudan’s banks to circulate U.S. dollars, to alleviate a shortage of foreign currency. Banks can now use U.S. dollars as required reserves and to conduct trade transactions, measures meant to rein in the informal currency exchange rate.

“What bothers us the most is the exchange rate in the parallel market, which has a negative effect on the banks, and so we work to attract the deposits of Sudanese expatriates,” said Fady al-Faqeih, general manager of the Bank of Khartoum, one of Sudan’s largest commercial banks.

The government puts annual transfers from Sudanese expats at $4 billion to $6 billion, most of which moves outside the banking system.

Sudanese authorities have also intensified a crackdown on black-market currency traders, including arrests, two traders told Reuters.

The Sudanese pound had weakened over the past year, hitting a record low of 22 pounds to the dollar on the black market on Tuesday. The central bank holds the official exchange rate at 6.7 pounds to the dollar.

The cheap pound contributed to surging inflation, which reached 35.13 percent in September year-on-year, up from 34.61 percent in August, according to the Central Statistics Office.

With unemployment estimated by the government at 19 percent, many hope that businesses re-entering Sudan will create badly needed jobs.

“The lifting of the sanctions is some of the best news we’ve heard in years,” said Abduallah Hussein, an unemployed management graduate. “We expect it’s going to lead to a fall in prices and improved healthcare and job opportunities.”",Sudan hopes for quick turnaround after sanctions end,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CV1X6-OZATP

Conte rotated his team after last Sunday’s 4-2 win over Watford in the Premier League and rested several key players, handing starts to 17-year-old Ethan Ampadu along with Brazilian Kenedy and Charly Musonda.

Ampadu, who was making his first start, and Kenedy played the full game while Musonda was substituted in the 70th minute as Chelsea held on to beat Everton despite a late goal from Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

“I am very happy - tonight I saw a lot of positive things - the young players’ performance. Charly Musonda, Kenedy, Ampadu - he is only 17 years old - they all played a very good game,” Conte told reporters after the match.

”It is important to trust in these players and I am happy because I had a good answer, the answer I was waiting for.

“I think that in these type of games the young players are improving - to see Ampadu tonight is important because we know we have many young players we can improve and give them opportunities.”

Conte said midfielder N‘Golo Kante was making steady progress in his recovery from a hamstring injury but the Italian was happy with the performance of Danny Drinkwater, who made his debut against Everton.

“The other good news was to see Danny Drinkwater,” Conte added.

“We will have three games before the international break and to see him fit 100 percent maybe after the international break. I can count him in games now. If I decide to play with three midfielders, it’s very important.”

Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag nach einer Sitzung des Aufsichtsrats in Eschborn bei Frankfurt mit. Kengeter werde das Unternehmen noch bis zum 31. Dezember führen. Zur Nachfolge des 50-jährigen ehemaligen Investmentbankers, der 2015 auf dem Chefsessel der Börse Platz genommen hatte, wurde zunächst nichts mitgeteilt. Die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die beim Wirtschaftsministerium in Wiesbaden angesiedelte hessische Börsenaufsicht erklärten nur Stunden nach Bekanntwerden des Rücktritts, dass sie die angekündigte Zuverlässigkeitsprüfung Kengeters nicht mehr vornehmen werden.

Zuletzt hatten Insider dem bisherigen Finanzchef Gregor Pottmeyer die besten Chancen eingeräumt, wenigstens für eine Übergangszeit. Aber auch andere Vorstandsmitglieder wurden genannt. Klaus Nieding von der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW) sagte zu Reuters, die Börse benötige nun einen nicht nur in der Branche gut vernetzten Chef, sondern einen Top-Manager, der auch intensive Beziehungen zur Landes- und Bundespolitik habe. Denn die Politik hat bei der Börse einen großen Einfluss. “Für die Deutsche Börse AG gilt es nach der britischen ”Brexit“-Entscheidung jetzt, die führende europäische Börse zu werden”, sagte Nieding.

An den Finanzmärkten wurde die Aussicht auf einen personellen Neuanfang mit Erleichterung aufgenommen. Die im Leitindex Dax notierte Börse-Aktie verteuerte sich um fast ein Prozent. Nach Handelsschluss werden auch noch die Quartalszahlen des Konzerns erwartet.

WIE GEHT ES WEITER?

Der Druck auf Kengeter war zuletzt massiv gestiegen: Die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt hatte erst Anfang der Woche die Ermittlungen gegen ihn wieder aufgenommen, nachdem zuvor ein Deal mit der Justiz am Widerspruch des zuständigen Gerichts gescheitert war. Sowohl im Aufsichtsrat als auch bei großen Aktionären der Börse hatten sich zuletzt die Stimmen gemehrt, die eine Ablösung Kengeters forderten. Der durch die Affäre enstandene Imageschaden für die Börse sei zu groß.

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, er habe Aktien der Deutschen Börse erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert. Kengeter beteuert bis heute seine Unschuld. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber, der das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm auf den Weg brachte, hatte sich lange hinter Kengeter gestellt. Allerdings war der Druck zuletzt auch auf Faber gestiegen - intern wie extern.

Der Deal mit der Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Einstellung des Verfahrens gegen eine Zahlung von 500.000 Euro durch Kengeter vor. Das Amtsgericht Frankfurt durchkreuzte die Pläne. Insider hatten daraufhin die Chanchen auf eine Verlängerung des Ende März 2018 auslaufenden Vertrages für den Manager als mehr oder weniger gleich null bezeichnet.

Doch selbst wenn der Deal geklappt hätte, wäre Kengeter noch nicht vom Haken gewesen. Denn die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die hessische Börsenaufsicht in Wiesbaden wollten anschließend die Zuverlässigkeit Kengeters in zwei getrennten Verfahren unter die Lupe nehmen. Die beiden Aufsichtsbehörden teilten am Donnerstag mit, dass diese Untersuchungen nicht mehr erfolgen sollen, da sie ohnehin nicht bis Kengeters Abgang beendet worden wären. “Wir erwarten unabhängig davon, dass das Unternehmen weiterhin seinen Aufgaben als Träger der Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse in vollem Umfang nachkommen wird”, sagte ein Sprecher des hessischen Wirtschaftsministeriums.",Börsen-Chef Kengeter nimmt wegen Insider-Affäre seinen Hut,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-deutsche-b-rse-idDEKBN1CV28F

With the economy having perked up slightly in the third quarter, it looks very likely that the Bank of England will in a week’s time deliver Britain’s first rate hike in more than a decade. [BOE/INT]

However, more than two-thirds of economists in a Reuters poll published on Tuesday said now was not the time for a hike.

That majority view was bolstered by Thursday’s data from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which said its monthly retail sales gauge fell to -36 this month from a two-year high of +42 in September, marking its lowest level since March 2009.

The reading was far below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, most of whom expected a reasonably modest slowdown in growth.

While the CBI survey is extremely volatile from month to month, the three-month average balance for reported retail sales sank to -1 from +18 in September - a 13-month low.

Despite Wednesday’s encouraging third quarter GDP reading, the outlook for the economy in coming months is mixed at best, and further complicated by uncertainty around the Brexit process.

JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said he tended to take Britain’s array of monthly retail surveys with a pinch of salt, but added that Thursday’s CBI survey raised concerns about momentum in the consumer economy.

“We don’t think this changes the BoE decision next week. But it could influence the degree of caution the (Monetary Policy Committee) expresses about the near term outlook,” he said in a note to clients.

The volume of orders that retailers placed with their suppliers also contracted at the fastest rate since 2009, the CBI said.

In the past this measure has linked well with the monthly IHS Markit/CIPS gauge of activity among consumer goods manufacturers.

“It’s clear retailers are beginning to really feel the pinch from higher inflation,” said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist.

“While retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the steep drop in sales in October echoes other recent data pointing to a marked softening in consumer demand.”

The Brexit vote in June 2016 led to a big fall in the value of sterling, which has pushed up inflation, gnawing at consumers’ disposable income this year.

Earlier on Thursday the British Retail Consortium reported that retailers cut jobs over the past three months at the fastest rate since comparable records began in 2008.

It cited a combination of technological change and government policies that pushed up employment costs as the main reasons for the fall.",UK retail sales plunge at fastest rate since 2009 - CBI,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-retail/uk-retail-sales-slide-in-october-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-cbi-idUKKBN1CV19U

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

The president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

The 37-year-old American and second-ranked Spaniard went into the encounter with 1-1 records in round-robin play and Williams, making her first appearance in the event since 2009, emerged with a 7-5 6-4 victory to progress to the last four.

“I‘m pretty used to going home after losing, so I knew what the stakes were,” a taciturn Williams told reporters when asked about her approach to the winner-takes-all White Group showdown.

Williams refused to dwell on the one hour, 41 minute encounter, instead saying she had already shifted the focus to her next match against the Red Group winner, most likely to be Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki.

“I‘m just focused on Saturday, trying to win again. So I don’t know if my levels dropped in the second set (against Muguruza),” she added, before praising the strong crowd support in Singapore where she is appearing for the first time.

Muguruza, who beat Williams 7-5 6-0 at Wimbledon, admitted she was baffled by her inability to overcome her veteran opponent after following up Tuesday’s group loss to Karolina Pliskova with another painful defeat.

“I wasn’t trying to get frustrated, because I knew I wasn’t playing my best tennis,” the 24-year-old said.

“I was just trying to be calm, to not get crazy and kind of waiting for my opportunity. And it didn’t come. In important moments, she stepped up and turned it around.”

Despite the disappointment, Muguruza was keen to highlight what a great year she had experienced after adding the Wimbledon title to her 2016 French Open triumph.

“I‘m very proud of this year. It’s not going to change. I knew here that it’s going to be tough, the best eight players are playing,” she added.

It said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January but also extend the buying program until the end of next September.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was recovering but still needed support.

“Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy,” he told a news conference. “Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.”

Designed nearly three years ago, the bond buys worth more than 2 trillion euros depressed borrowing costs and lifted growth but failed to raise inflation to the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent.

That forced the bank to hedge its bets with what some investors described as “dovish policy tightening”.

The ECB will now cut its bond buys in half to 30 billion euros a month from January given robust growth, it kept the option to raise or extend buys and promised to reinvest maturing funds for years to come.

It also promised banks ample liquidity and said the bond buys would not end suddenly, suggesting that another extension, even if only to gradually wind down purchases, is likely.

“This is not tapering, it’s just a down-size,” Draghi said, using the market term for beginning to exit a stimulus program.

“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly,” he added. “There is still a large amount of uncertainty.”

The cautious move may also have reflected policymakers' concern about the euro's appreciation against the dollar EUR= this year and their aim to keep the currency stable after its surge over the summer.

The euro fell nearly 0.8 percent on the day even as Draghi omitted a now customary reference about the need to monitor the currency.

“Today’s decision is the first real baby step towards a very gentle exit from the ECB’s crisis mode, but it is definitely not a big-bang u-turn,” ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

“In fact, the ... recalibration illustrates the ECB wants to start the exit as cautiously as possible, ideally without seeing the euro appreciate or bond yields increase.”

DILEMMA

The biggest debate appeared to be about whether to keep asset buys open ended, with Draghi highlighting dissent from hawks, who wanted the ECB pave the way to the exit.

Still, Draghi said there was a large majority for an open-ended program while other issues were supported by consensus or near consensus.

Hawks such as Germany and the Netherlands have argued that growth is now above trend and more purchases do next to nothing for inflation, so keeping the program open ended is not justified. Doves on the bloc’s periphery, however, warned that a quick exit could tighten financial conditions, undoing years of work.

“The fact that the ECB made the tapering decision look as dovish as possible because of the weak inflation causes a risk of a later move in rates than in our forecast,” Nordea economist Tuuli Koivu said.

“The possible first rate hike – even if only a cosmetic in nature - that we expect to see in the first quarter of 2019 may come later,” he added.

The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.

Draghi said data pointed to unabated growth as employment rises, households continue to spend and exports are on the upswing.

Yet, underlying inflation has not yet shown any convincing signs of an upwards trend and the outlook for both inflation and growth remained conditional on continued support from the ECB.

“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration,” Draghi said.

Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.

The ECB, meanwhile is slowly running out of bonds to buy, But Draghi dismissed arguments that scarcity of available debt would constrain the program as the ECB had plenty of flexibility.

Still, economists argue that the ECB will be nearing its limits by the end of its nine month extension, particularly in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, making another extension difficult without a major redesign of parameters.

“Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,” Draghi said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index rose 1.1 percent to 391.45 points with heavy gains across most sectors and trading centers, particularly in Germany where the DAX .GDAXI touched an all time closing high with a 1.4 percent rise.

The euro’s tumble provided European stocks with their biggest gains in over six weeks, as the ECB’s Mario Draghi said the bank would extend asset purchases until at least September 2018 at a reduced pace.

“Anything that suggests the euro isn’t going up in a straight line is potentially good news for European equities,” Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street, told Reuters.

Sandrine Perret, European Strategist at Credit Suisse, said the move was likely to continue to fuel the bull market.

“The decision should lead to further strength for European equities,” she wrote in a note, adding that strong economic growth should bolster corporate earnings.

Spain's IBEX .IBEX closed up 1.9 percent as hopes of a breakthrough in the Catalan crisis fueled optimism among investors.

While shares in retailer DIA (DIDA.MC) slumped 4.8 percent to a five-year low after it issued a profit warning, most Spanish blue-chips posted substantial gains, notably heavyweight banks such as Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) or Banco Santander (SAN.MC), both up 3.2 percent.

While stocks markets have seen very little volatility recently, the latest earnings season has triggered some outsized moves.

Nokia (NOKIA.HE) was the biggest faller on the STOXX, losing a spectacular 17.5 percent after the Finnish firm reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings.

“Difficult to say at this stage how much lower consensus could go given all the negative wording on 2018,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.

Barclays (BARC.L) tumbled 7.4 percent in its biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The British bank posted worse than expected profit before tax due to a weak trading performance by its investment bank.

Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) also reported a drop in investment bank revenue, although cost cuts lifted profit above analysts’ expectations. Its shares closed 0.9 percent lower. [nL8N1N110W]

Also in the banking sector, Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region biggest bank, sank 5.9 percent after saying it would miss its 2018 cost target and cut at least 6,000 jobs.

Heavy losses were offset by swings in positive territory like Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) which ended the day up 12 percent after raising its year-end outlook.

Other winners of the day included Finnish petroleum producer’s Neste (NESTE.HE), up 9 percent after its third-quarter results came in above expectations.

According to Thomson Reuters data, third-quarter earning growth expectations for the STOXX 600 have declined to 3.4 percent from around 10 percent expected in July.

A country breakdown shows that earnings of UK companies in the pan-European index are expected to rise 11.2 percent in the third quarter, compared to a fall of 11.8 percent seen for France and a 0.6 percent drop expected for Germany.

Nearly 40 percent of Pakistan’s 50 million school-age children are not getting regular instruction, even though it has a network of 220,000 schools and has stepped up its education budget 15 percent each year since 2010.

“It’s not the number of schools, it’s the quality, the attitude,” said Zeba Hussain, who founded the Mashal Schools for the war-displaced children after meeting a group of them during a visit to the hills encircling the capital, Islamabad.“The teachers, and the approach, is absolutely off.”

Now private schools, charitable bodies, and religious seminaries are piecing together what they call a broken government schooling system, whose budget the United Nations estimates at 2.65 percent of GDP, or roughly $8 billion.

That works out to about $150 per student.

“Students are labelled ‘smart’ or ‘stupid’ right from the start,” said Shaista Kazmi of Vision 21, a privately funded non-government body whose programs for underprivileged children aim to compress five years of reading proficiency into one.

“The government is very slow to respond to calls for change,” added Kazmi, whose NGO focuses its speed literacy programs in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The standardised curriculum of state schools fails to account for socio-economic limitations, setting children up for failure, said Hussain.

“Students end up with low self-esteem,” she said. “There need to be different models of curriculum which can lift children up from the bottom.”

Responding to the comments, federal education director Tariq Masood disagreed strongly, pointing to population growth and funding as the biggest challenges for government schools.

“No one who is under-qualified can enter the government system,” Masood told Reuters. “There are fewer checks in the private system.”

PRIVATE SCHOOLS FOR URBAN ELITE

The urban elite turn to private schools to fill the education vacuum, using a British curriculum rather than government textbooks.

“We are privileged to have access to curriculum that allows us to teach reading without rote memorization,” said Nadine Murtaza, executive director of Head Start, which has 13 facilities in and around the capital.

Such schools partner with charitable outfits and the government to reach children outside the private school setup.

“You have fifth and sixth graders (in government schools) who cannot read,” Murtaza said.

Pakistan’s poorest often send their children to a network of 25,000 traditional Islamic religious schools known as madrassas, which also give them accommodation and food, though few are subject to government oversight.

Such schools have been blamed for creating militant fighters by spreading a hardline vision of Islam, with some accused of links to outfits such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

Still, some madrassas do provide a good education to those whose families cannot make ends meet.

“In certain cases people send their kids because they can’t even afford to feed them,” said Irfan Sher of the Al-Nadwa Madrassa, where students are taught to analyse what they study.

“The overall policy should be changed,” said Sher adding that Pakistan’s future hinges on what its youth learn. “If they want to change the country, the only way is to spread quality education.”",Pakistan's creaking education system struggles to teach young people,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-education/pakistans-creaking-education-system-struggles-to-teach-young-people-idINKBN1CV2A4

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

FILE PHOTO: Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey takes part in a panel discussion on Sharia law at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-woolsey-exclusive/exclusive-while-advising-trump-in-2016-ex-cia-chief-proposed-plan-to-discredit-turkish-cleric-idUSKBN1CV2RF

The Oct. 14-23 poll found that 62 percent of Americans want former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law to be maintained, up from 54 percent in a January poll. About half – including 51 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans – want “a bipartisan group” rather than just members of their own parties to improve the healthcare system.

“It’s not enough just to rip up the law,” said Tim Lukasek, 45, who has insurance provided by his employer in St. Louis but likes a feature of Obamacare that allows him to cover his young adult children under his insurance policy. Lukasek described himself as more likely to vote Democrat.

“It should be a bipartisan mix of people hashing this out, and then everyone needs to agree on it,” he said.

Republican lawmakers have repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, saying it represents government overreach into personal healthcare decisions and drives up prices for consumers.

More than 20 million Americans have obtained medical coverage under Obamacare, and Democrats warn that killing the law would cut many of them off from insurance.

President Donald Trump, who had promised during his 2016 election campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare and has vowed to let the law implode, this month terminated subsidies paid to health insurers that help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans.

Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, and Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, have proposed a short-term fix to restore the subsidies for two years to stabilize the individual insurance markets created by Obamacare until a longer-term replacement can be negotiated.

“There are a lot of issues, but I think (the politicians) should just put their differences aside and think about what’s better for everyone else in the country,” said Kadee Matthew, a veterinary technician who lives outside of Birmingham, Alabama, and identifies as a moderate Republican.

Poll participants were split over who would do a better job at the repairs. Democrats were more likely to say the federal government, while Republicans were more likely to prefer that U.S. states take the lead.

The majority of those surveyed believe the law has been successful at “expanding health insurance coverage in the U.S.” Responses were split along party lines, with most Democrats saying it was successful and most Republicans saying it was not.

“It was working until now, but a lot of rocks are being thrown at it,” said Catherine Evans, a stay-at-home mom in Silver Spring, Maryland, who said she is more likely to vote Democratic.

She noted Trump’s decision to cut off billions of dollars in subsidy payments to insurers. Insurers have raised monthly premium costs for the most popular Obamacare plans by 34 percent, on average, for 2018, according to an analysis by Avalere Health.

A majority of adults – 56 percent – said they opposed Trump’s decision on subsidies, versus 29 percent who supported it.

Evans said she would like to see both political parties work together to stabilize the insurance market, but “I don’t think right now they are capable of that. The way they are behaving is so childish and petty. It’s ridiculous.”

Healthcare experts say that Trump’s moves to undermine the law and statements declaring Obamacare as “dead” have created confusion among consumers who were planning to enroll, beginning next week, in health coverage for 2018.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Their base scenario is that the vote can conclude largely smoothly. However, given that Kenya’s external debt is rated B+ but trading at levels more akin to bonds with ratings two notches lower, this means assets have already adjusted to the uncertainty and any negative surprises may have less of an impact.

And Nairobi’s $1.5 billion stand-by facility deal with the International Monetary Fund provides additional comfort.

East Africa’s largest economy has slipped into turmoil since a Supreme Court ruling annulled the result of presidential elections in August. Matters worsened when opposition leader Raila Odinga quit the re-run against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta.

“In the very, very near term ... with the ruling we had in September, the period of uncertainty was extended to up until this point,” said Diana Amoa, portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But the outlook going forward - once we get past this period - should be a positive one.”

Police clashed with opposition supporters on Thursday and gangs of youths prevented voting in some towns. A handful of polling officials who pitched up to work in Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, cowered behind closed doors, unable to distribute any voting material.

However, the government said the security situation was by and large “OK”, with polling stations open in over 90 percent of the country.

For funds active in Africa and across frontier markets - a sub-set of riskier, smaller developing countries - the $55 billion Kenyan economy has been a firm part of their portfolios.

The country’s $2.75 billion in dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2019 and 2024 form part of major emerging market debt benchmarks and frontier indexes.

Year-to-date, Kenyan dollar bonds have chalked up solid returns of more than 12 percent compared with nearly 9 percent on the index.

However, the political stand-off has blunted economic growth in Kenya, which has been largely stable since the violence a decade ago.

Kenyan debt has still underperformed its peers, said Gabriele Foa, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He noted that yield premiums over U.S. debt had not narrowed as much as those on other sub-Saharan debt.

“When you look at the spreads with Angola, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, that has been widening over this year,” said Foa, who has an “overweight” rating on Kenya’s dollar bonds. “We saw a compression in line with the region, but Kenya is definitely lagging.”

Still, investors are also upbeat on the local government bond market, worth 1,387 billion shillings ($13.4 billion). The Kenyan shilling has been broadly unshaken by the political events, softening just over 1 percent since the start of the year.

Previous experience points towards the shilling bouncing back swiftly. When violence ripped through the country following the 2007 elections, the shilling fell about 15 percent against the dollar, but recovered to pre-vote levels within three months.

Any softness in the currency, coupled with low foreign positioning overall in those assets, made local debt attractive, said JPMorgan’s Amoa.

Investors in Kenya’s $22.3 billion stock market have been more cautious. While the Nairobi Stock Exchange All Share Index has risen around 17 percent since the start of the year in dollar terms, the gains fall well short of the 30 percent jump across emerging equities more broadly.

“Foreign investors have been generally in wait-and-see mode with some net selling at the margin,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Exotix Capital.

The percentage of Nairobi-listed stocks owned by foreigners has edged down to 21 percent in 2017 from a peak of 22.5 percent in 2013. Yet those waiting on the sidelines may well be happy to return if and when the political impasse has been resolved.

“Kenya is the great hope for investors in Africa as a non-commodity producing country, which has the potential to industrialize ahead of its peers, with money going into railways, roads and ports,” said Daniel Salter, head of equity strategy at Renaissance Capital.

“It is a country that investors want to like, but what they don’t like is the current uncertainty.”

A large part of the company’s profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades. Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400.

The company redesigned its larger F-series Super Duty pickups a year ago, and recently updated its standard F-150 trucks for model year 2018.

Ford said its North American margin rose to 8.1 percent from 5.8 percent a year earlier. Earlier this week, GM reported a third-quarter margin for North America of 8.3 percent.

Ford plans to begin testing self-driving vehicles in some cities in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett disclosed on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, but gave no details.

Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said. He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said.

Rival General Motors Co said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020. GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023.

Year to date, GM’s stock is up nearly 30 percent, while Ford is down almost 1 percent. In mid-morning trade, Ford was up 0.3 percent to $12.08.

Wall Street has been underwhelmed by Ford, particularly by Hackett’s caveat that most of the company’s $14 billion in planned cost savings will not show up on Ford‘s bottom line until 2019 and 2020.

When asked by reporters about the flagging stock, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford has a “really good plan” for electric vehicles and self-driving car technology.

“I think the market will reward us,” he said.

On the earnings call on Thursday, Shanks said Ford will “aggressively restructure the business as required to achieve our objectives ... We are prepared to do what we have to do.”

He did not provide details.

Apart from North America, the only other region that was profitable for Ford was Asia Pacific, where a record profit was driven by sales increases outside China. CFO Shanks said sales volumes, market share and margins were all down in China.

He said Ford’s European operations would return to profitability in the fourth quarter and for the full year.

Ford said it had lower engineering, advertising and promotion expenses than in the third quarter.

The second largest U.S. automaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.56 billion, or 39 cents per share, up more than 60 percent from $960 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 43 cents, above Wall Street expectations of 32 cents.

Revenue rose to $36.45 billion from $35.94 billion a year earlier.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Domino, a quien se dio por muerto cuando el huracán Katrina devastó su barrio en Nueva Orleans en 2005, falleció en su casa el martes de causas naturales, informaron las autoridades locales de Jefferson Parish.

El pianista, uno de los pioneros del rock ‘n’ roll en los inicios de la década de 1950, vendió 65 millones de discos, más que cualquier otro músico de su época sin contar a Elvis Presley, de acuerdo al Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Domino fue artífice de decenas de éxitos como “Blueberry Hill”, “Ain’t That a Shame”, “Blue Monday”, “I‘m Walkin’”, “Whole Lotta Loving”, “Hello, Josephine”, “Walking to New Orleans”, “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” y “Let the Four Winds Blow”.

“Al no haber mejor forma de decirlo, hay que calificarlo como una leyenda que vive y camina entre nosotros en Nueva Orleans”, dijo Irma Thomas al New York Times en 2007. “Él y Louis Armstrong fueron los primeros en ponernos en el mapa musical”.

Antoine Dominique Domino nació el 26 de febrero en 1928 en Nueva Orleans como uno de nueve hermanos. Un hermanastro le enseño a tocar el piano, y con el tiempo creó un estilo que combinó el sonido clásico de Nueva Orleans con blues, música country y Cajun.

Siendo un adolescente ya tocaba en clubes nocturnos y muy joven se unió musicalmente al trompetista Dave Bartholomew, con quien comenzó a componer y que le ayudó a producir sus canciones y refinar su estilo al piano.

Su sobrenombre se dio por su baja estatura y como un tributo a los pianistas Fats Waller y Fats Pichon.

Al igual que sus contemporáneos Little Richard y Chuck Berry, Domino fue un músico negro cuyas composiciones llegaron a la audiencia blanca y le dieron forma al rock naciente.

Su primer éxito fue una canción de R&B, la autobiográfica “The Fat Man”, grabada en 1949 y considerada por muchos como una de las primeras canciones del rock ‘n’ roll.

Domino se convertiría en una gran influencia para muchas estrellas de rock. John Lennon dijo en una entrevista radial que “Ain’t That a Shame” fue la primera canción que aprendió a tocar.

El guitarrista Vernon Reid, de la banda Living Color, lamentó la muerte de Domino y el miércoles dijo en Twitter que “El rock & Roll ha perdido parte de su alma”.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS now weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

A Câmara rejeitou autorizar o Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) a analisar a acusação contra Temer por organização criminosa e obstrução da Justiça por 251 votos a 233. O apoio ao Planalto ficou menor do que os 257 votos que representam a maioria absoluta dos 513 deputados e bastante aquém do quórum constitucional de 308 votos para aprovar medidas como a reforma da Previdência.

Em agosto, quando os deputados rejeitaram a primeira denúncia contra Temer, o placar foi de 263 a 227.

“Eu acho que 2017 terminou hoje, e amanhã começa 2018”, disse o cientista político Carlos Melo, do Insper. “E Temer entra em 2018 mais fraco que imaginava”, acrescentou.

Para Rafael Cortez, analista político da Tendências Consultoria Integrada, o placar da votação da denúncia indica o esgotamento do capital político do governo, o que complica o já difícil cenário para aprovação de reformas, como a da Previdência.

Agravam as chances de aprovar mudanças previdenciárias o fato de elas serem impopulares e a proximidade da eleição do ano que vem, menos de um ano.

“Se a margem de erro do governo já era pequena, agora é praticamente nula”, avaliou Cortez.

Os analistas lembraram que o resultado também pode impulsionar o protagonismo do presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), que tem sinalizado a intenção de promover uma agenda econômica à revelia do Palácio do Planalto, com quem registrou atritos recentes.

Neste cenário, Temer dependerá ainda mais do Legislativo e, diante de um resultado mais desfavorável do que em agosto entre deputados do PSDB, deverá sofrer uma pressão mais intensa do chamado centrão.

“(O resultado) só consolida o fato de que Temer continua na mão do Congresso”, disse Danilo Gennari, sócio da Distrito Relações Governamentais em Brasília. “Acho pouco provável que o governo consiga mobilizar para grandes reformas”, acrescentou.

Gennari lembrou que a correlação dentro do PSDB nesta votação se alterou em relação à primeira denúncia em agosto. Agora, 23 tucanos votaram pelo seguimento da denúncia, enquanto 20 votaram pela rejeição. Em agosto, 22 votaram a favor do presidente e 21 contra.

O resultado, na avaliação de Gennari, deve aumentar a pressão de parlamentares do centrão sobre Temer para que o presidente entregue espaços que o PSDB ocupa no governo, especialmente o comando da Secretaria de Governo, comandada pelo deputado tucano Antonio Imbassahy (BA).

“O centrão sai mais fortalecido e certamente mais sedento”, disse Gennari.

Temer foi acusado pelo ex-procurador-geral da República Rodrigo Janot, que afirmou que o presidente deu aval para que o empresário Joesley Batista, um dos donos da JBS, comprasse o silêncio do ex-deputado Eduardo Cunha e apontou Temer como chefe de uma organização criminosa formada por membros do PMDB.",ANÁLISE-Placar de votação da denúncia complica poder de agenda legislativa de Temer,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CV03U-OBRTP

It said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January but also extend the buying program until the end of next September.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was recovering but still needed support.

“Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy,” he told a news conference. “Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.”

Designed nearly three years ago, the bond buys worth more than 2 trillion euros depressed borrowing costs and lifted growth but failed to raise inflation to the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent.

That forced the bank to hedge its bets with what some investors described as “dovish policy tightening”.

The ECB will now cut its bond buys in half to 30 billion euros a month from January given robust growth, it kept the option to raise or extend buys and promised to reinvest maturing funds for years to come.

It also promised banks ample liquidity and said the bond buys would not end suddenly, suggesting that another extension, even if only to gradually wind down purchases, is likely.

“This is not tapering, it’s just a down-size,” Draghi said, using the market term for beginning to exit a stimulus program.

“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly,” he added. “There is still a large amount of uncertainty.”

The cautious move may also have reflected policymakers' concern about the euro's appreciation against the dollar EUR= this year and their aim to keep the currency stable after its surge over the summer.

The euro fell nearly 0.8 percent on the day even as Draghi omitted a now customary reference about the need to monitor the currency.

“Today’s decision is the first real baby step towards a very gentle exit from the ECB’s crisis mode, but it is definitely not a big-bang u-turn,” ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

“In fact, the ... recalibration illustrates the ECB wants to start the exit as cautiously as possible, ideally without seeing the euro appreciate or bond yields increase.”

DILEMMA

The biggest debate appeared to be about whether to keep asset buys open ended, with Draghi highlighting dissent from hawks, who wanted the ECB pave the way to the exit.

Still, Draghi said there was a large majority for an open-ended program while other issues were supported by consensus or near consensus.

Hawks such as Germany and the Netherlands have argued that growth is now above trend and more purchases do next to nothing for inflation, so keeping the program open ended is not justified. Doves on the bloc’s periphery, however, warned that a quick exit could tighten financial conditions, undoing years of work.

“The fact that the ECB made the tapering decision look as dovish as possible because of the weak inflation causes a risk of a later move in rates than in our forecast,” Nordea economist Tuuli Koivu said.

“The possible first rate hike – even if only a cosmetic in nature - that we expect to see in the first quarter of 2019 may come later,” he added.

The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.

Draghi said data pointed to unabated growth as employment rises, households continue to spend and exports are on the upswing.

Yet, underlying inflation has not yet shown any convincing signs of an upwards trend and the outlook for both inflation and growth remained conditional on continued support from the ECB.

“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration,” Draghi said.

Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.

The ECB, meanwhile is slowly running out of bonds to buy, But Draghi dismissed arguments that scarcity of available debt would constrain the program as the ECB had plenty of flexibility.

Still, economists argue that the ECB will be nearing its limits by the end of its nine month extension, particularly in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, making another extension difficult without a major redesign of parameters.

“Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,” Draghi said.

Em uma entrevista à rede Fox Business Network, Trump disse que seria mais fácil resolver a crise nuclear com Pyongyang se os EUA tivessem um relacionamento melhor com a Rússia.

“A China está nos ajudando, e talvez a Rússia esteja passando para o outro lado e atrapalhando o que estamos conseguindo”, afirmou Trump, a respeito da situação com a Coreia do Norte.

Uma série de testes de armas do regime e uma troca de farpas verbais entre Trump e o líder norte-coreano, Kim Jong Un, aumentaram as tensões.

Trump vem pressionando para que Pequim contenha o programa nuclear da Coreia do Norte. A China, única grande aliada de Pyongyang, representa mais de 90 por cento do comércio com o país isolado.

O líder norte-americano disse em um tuíte que conversou com seu colega chinês, Xi Jinping, nesta quinta-feira e que a conversa incluiu a Coreia do Norte.

As relações entre Washington e Moscou estão tensionadas devido às alegações de que a Rússia interferiu na eleição presidencial de 2016, à anexação russa da península ucraniana da Crimeia e ao apoio do Kremlin ao governo da Síria.

Santander’s shares were up 0.7 percent on Thursday, against a 0.5 percent drop on the European STOXX banking index .SX7P, after it reported a net profit of 1.46 billion euros (£1.31 billion).

Analysts, who on average had forecast a net profit of 1.85 billion euros, had expected Santander to begin booking costs related to Popular in the last quarter of 2017.

However, Santander consolidated Popular into its accounts for the entire third quarter after taking it over in June for a nominal one euro after European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse following a run on the bank.

Santander has said it expects total restructuring costs of around 1.3 billion euros related to the deal. In the third quarter, the absorption hit net profit by 122 million euros.

The bank was not expecting to book further restructuring costs this year apart from 300 million euros incurred in the third quarter, chief executive officer, Jose Antonio Alvarez, said in a conference call to analysts.

Excluding extraordinary charges, Santander’s underlying net profit rose 17 percent, boosted by its main market, Brazil, where net profit jumped 35 percent.

Brazil outperformed the bank’s other units, including Britain where net profit grew almost 4 percent.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank highlighted that the lender had booked revenue growth in eight of its ten core markets.

As with its recent positive strategy update - when it slightly lifted its 2018 profitability targets - the bank’s quarterly results are expected to be partially overshadowed by the independence stand-off in Catalonia, where Santander has a 13 market share of deposits.

In an attempt to calm deposit holders following a banned Oct. 1 vote for independence in the region, Caixabank (CABK.MC) and Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), the most exposed to Catalonia, moved their legal headquarters out of the region

Santander’s CEO said the situation in Catalonia was not good for business throughout Spain, though it was still too early to assess the impact on activity.

Santander’s net interest income (NII) - a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs - was 8.7 billion euros in the quarter, up 11.3 percent from last year but up just 0.9 percent against the previous quarter.

Like European rivals, Santander is struggling to lift earnings from loans in Spain as interest rates hover at historic lows and rising competition erodes margins.

In the Spanish home market, NII was down 0.3 percent from last year.

Santander ended September with a core tier-1 fully loaded ratio of 10.80 percent, compared to 10.72 percent in July.

It also reiterated it was on track to meet financial targets, including double digit earnings per share growth by 2018.

The bank cut its non-performing loan ratio to 4.24 percent of total loans at end-September from 5.37 percent in June after sold a majority stake in a 30 billion euros property portfolio inherited from Popular.",Popular takes shine off Brazil-driven Santander profit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-santander-results/popular-takes-shine-off-brazil-driven-santander-profit-idUKKBN1CV0EP?il=0

Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to unite her divided conservative alliance, which suffered bruising losses in a national election last month, in a pact with two other parties that is untested at federal level.

Politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving Germany politically weakened as the European Union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform within the bloc.

In the first two rounds of talks, the CDU/CSU conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens defied expectations by on Tuesday finding substantial common ground on fiscal policy.

But as further talks got under way on Thursday there were signs of a rethink in process. “We only set out (fiscal) goals,” the Greens’ Juergen Trittin told Bild newspaper.

Arriving for the negotiations, Alexander Dobrindt -- negotiator for the Bavaria-based conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) -- said he was far from sure that they would be as successful on Thursday’s “heavyweight agenda”.

That includes immigration, potentially the most divisive topic after many blamed the conservatives’ election setback on the open-door refugee policy that Merkel implemented through 2015 and into 2016.

“Without limits on immigration, Jamaica will remain an island in the Caribbean but will certainly not be a coalition in Berlin,” Dobrindt said. “What happened in 2015 must never be repeated.”

The three-way coalition, which has governed at regional level, is so named because the parties’ colors match the Jamaican flag.

Germany’s demographic landscape changed overnight in 2015 after Merkel, in the face of refugee flows on a scale not seen since World War Two, opened its borders to more than a million migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa.

While some hailed the decision as a humanitarian act, many in her camp blame her for the subsequent surge in the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, which took seats from her bloc.

While Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CSU have agreed to limit migration, many experts say an absolute cap on refugee numbers would violate the German constitution.

The Greens want to maintain a more generous immigration policy, are advocates of closer European integration - opposed by the FDP - and are adamant that Germany stick to all climate targets.

“I understand it hurts if parties can’t implement promises they made in the election campaign,” said Greens co-chief Cem Ozdemir. “We have to explain to people that some of those promises were dreams and now it’s reality.”

For Wolfgang Kubicki of the FDP, a potential candidate for finance minister, closing that gap may be problematic.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

Kennedy was struck down by an assassin’s bullet in Dallas, Texas, the United States is due on Thursday to release the final files on the investigation into the killing that rattled a nation.

Academics who have studied Kennedy’s slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected the final batch of files to offer no major new details on why Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down the first and only Irish-American Roman Catholic to hold the office.

They also feared that the final batch of more than 5 million total pages on the Kennedy assassination held in the National Archives will do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old president’s killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was shot dead a day after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, though they retain a powerful cultural currency.

“My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin,” said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. “It’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But that’s where the evidence is.”

In 1992, Congress ordered that all records relating to the investigation into Kennedy’s death should be open to the public, and set a final deadline of Oct. 26, 2017 for the entire set to be made public.

President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that he would allow the documents to be made public.

The documents to be released on Thursday will likely focus on efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine what contact Oswald had with spies from Cuba and the former Soviet Union on a trip to Mexico City in September 1963, experts said.

“There was a real concern that Oswald was maybe in league with the Soviet Union,” Maney said.

Kennedy's assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

The sacking of Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of five opposition governors in Venezuela’s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all-powerful national legislative superbody aligned with President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling socialists.

“They held a secret, express session to remove him,” Guanipa’s spokeswoman Erika Gutierrez told Reuters of the morning meeting of Zulia’s state legislature.

Venezuela’s opposition Democratic Unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti-Maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month’s state elections.

Despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over Venezuela’s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five state compared to 18 for Maduro’s Socialist Party candidates.

Opposition leaders blamed both dirty tricks by the government, including the last-minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, and abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year.

Driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly could take office.

Four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but Guanipa said he would never “kneel before the dictatorship.”

“This is an assault on the will of the people,” he tweeted after his removal on Tuesday, denouncing a “coup” in the oil-rich state on the border with Colombia.","Venezuelan anti-Maduro governor sacked, opposition in chaos",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-opposition/venezuelan-anti-maduro-governor-sacked-opposition-in-chaos-idUSKBN1CV2MR

Johnson was speaking on Oct. 17 at the Belvedere Forum on UK-Polish relations, according to the British Embassy in Warsaw in remarks which were reported by The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.

“I have only one message for you all tonight, you know exactly what it is: You are loved, you are welcome, your rights will be protected, whatever happens,” Johnson said in a video posted by the embassy on its Twitter feed.

Earlier this month, May said it was a priority to protect EU citizens’ rights and an agreement with the EU was near but the government has resisted calls to unilaterally guarantee their rights.

In a letter to EU citizens last week, May said:

“I want to give reassurance that this issue remains a priority, that we are united on the key principles, and that the focus over the weeks to come will be delivering an agreement that works for people here in the UK, and people in the EU.”

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said Johnson was not diverging from May’s comments: “The Foreign Secretary was simply reiterating our determination to achieve this.”

Last year there were just over 900,000 Poles living in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics and Johnson praised their contribution to British life including through 30,000 businesses.

But some have returned home in recent months, concerned about their status following the Brexit referendum which many saw as a vote against recent immigration from Eastern Europe.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

Vitor Constancio defended the ECB’s latest guidelines, which force banks to set aside more money for new loans turning sour. But he said upcoming rules on soured credit left over from the financial crisis - a big issue for Italy - will be “different” and “careful”.

Reuters reported last week that ECB supervisors were having to rethink their approach on the stock of soured credit, initially based on the same targets set for new non-performing loans (NPLs), due to a backlash from Italy.

“We’re looking of course very careful(ly) because it’s different to deal with new NPLs and deal with targets for the whole stock,” Constancio said at the ECB’s regular news conference.

He described the latest guidelines on new loans, which give banks seven years to provide for credit backed by collateral and two years for unsecured debt, as “reasonable” and in line with new accounting standards.

But Constancio said they would be applied with some flexibility.

“Compliance with these targets will be subject to the supervisory dialogue,” he said. “The banks... can explain that they have done the utmost to comply and could not do it.”

Announced this month, the ECB’s guidelines on new bad loans met with a fierce backlash in Italy, where the banking lobby, government, central bank and even top European parliamentarians said the new rules jeopardized economic growth and went beyond Frankfurt’s remit.

The main worry for them is that Italian banks, if asked to set aside more money, may curtail lending. Some may even need to raise capital - a task that has eluded Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two regional lenders in recent months, triggering state interventions.

The ECB is now due to come up with a new set of guidelines by March for provisions on existing bad loans - an even thornier issue in Italy, where lenders are sitting on a quarter of the euro zone’s total pile of bad loans.

Supervisors had been working on scenarios closely reflecting the guidelines on new NPLs but were now rethinking their approach due to the outcry in Italy, the sources told Reuters.

Italian banks’ non-performing exposure, which includes unpaid loans and other types of soured credit, fell by 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to 212 billion euros in the three months to June, the ECB quarterly statistics showed this week.

This was a greater drop than in any other country in absolute and relative terms.

Provisional results showed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals won the constituency of Lac-Saint-Jean with about 36 percent of the vote, with the separatist Bloc Quebecois in second place and the opposition Conservatives close behind in third.

The Conservatives had held the seat before the sitting legislator retired earlier this year.

The Liberals, who now hold 41 of Quebec’s 78 seats, privately say they need to win another 12 in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere and maintain their majority in the House of Commons in an election in October 2019.

Zwar brachen die Erträge der Investmentbank und im Wertpapierhandel abermals ein, dafür sorgten aber geringere Kosten für Rechtsstreitigkeiten und der laufende Personal- und Filialabbau für mehr Geld in der Kasse. Deshalb schlug Cryan optimistischere Töne an als zuletzt: “Wir sind überzeugt, dass die Früchte unserer Arbeit in den kommenden Quartalen und Jahren Schritt für Schritt sichtbarer werden”, erklärte er. Der Umbau im Privatkundengeschäft und der Börsengang der Vermögensverwaltung werden konkret.

An der Börse wurde Cryans Botschaft allerdings ignoriert: Die Deutsche-Bank-Aktie fiel um gut zwei Prozent auf 14,20 Euro und war damit einer der größten Dax-Verlierer. “Der Gewinnschub ist eine reine Kostengeschichte, operativ läuft es gar nicht gut”, sagte ein Händler in Frankfurt. “Die Marke Deutsche Bank scheint nicht mehr zu ziehen.”

Das Vorsteuerergebnis stieg im dritten Quartal trotz eines zehnprozentigen Ertragsrückgangs auf 933 Millionen Euro - ein Plus von 51 Prozent. Unter dem Strich standen 649 Millionen Euro zu Buche - mehr als doppelt so viel wie vor einem Jahr. Ein Grund war, dass die Bank weniger Geld für Skandale der Vergangenheit ausgeben musste. Die größten Rechtsstreitigkeiten sind mittlerweile zu den Akten gelegt. Erst am Mittwoch war ein weiterer Vergleich in der Affäre um manipulierte Referenzzinssätze bekannt geworden, für den das Institut 220 Millionen Dollar berappt.

Cryan deutete in einem Brief an die Belegschaft an, dass bei vielen Kunden das Vertrauen in die Deutsche Bank zurückkehrt. “Wir waren selten zuvor in einem Quartal so erfolgreich darin, uns künftiges Geschäft zu sichern”, schrieb der Brite, dem einige zuletzt nur noch Monate gegeben hatten, bis die Geduld von Ankerinvestoren wie dem Emirat Katar oder der chinesischen HNA-Gruppe reißt. Am Donnerstag tagte auch der Aufsichtsrat in Frankfurt und beriet über das Zahlenwerk.

SCHWÄCHER ALS DIE KONKURRENZ

Im prestigeträchtigen und hochmargigen Investmentbanking machte sich die von Cryan wahrgenommene neue Lust der Kunden auf seine Bank in den vergangenen Monaten noch nicht bemerkbar. Die Erträge fielen um 23 Prozent auf 3,5 Milliarden Euro. Im wichtigen Handel mit Anleihen und Währungen brachen die Erträge wegen der Zurückhaltung vieler großer Anleger sogar um 36 Prozent ein.

Große US-Konkurrenten wie Goldman Sachs oder Morgan Stanley hatten hier zwar ebenfalls Federn lassen müssen, allerdings weniger als die Deutsche Bank, die noch vor wenigen Jahren das Geschäft dominiert hatte. Helmut Hipper, Fondsmanager bei Union Investment, einem der 20 größten Aktionäre, bemängelte: “Die anderen Bereiche der Bank sehen stabiler aus. Eine Trendwende ist kurzfristig nicht zu erwarten.”

HOFFNUNG AUF EINEN BONUS

Insgesamt gelang es Cryan, die Kosten im Quartal um 14 Prozent auf 5,7 Milliarden Euro zu drücken. Dazu trug nicht zuletzt der weitere Abbau von Personal und die Schließung von Filialen sowie der Rückzug aus einigen Märkten bei. Insgesamt hat die Deutsche Bank heute 4000 Mitarbeiter weniger als noch vor einem Jahr. Die verbleibende Mannschaft kann darauf hoffen, nach der erzwungenen Pause im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr nun wieder einen Bonus zu bekommen. Die Bank habe für die variable Vergütung mehr Geld zurückgelegt, schrieb Cryan in seinem Mitarbeiterbrief. Ob es für 2017 nach den harten Sanierungsjahren auch eine Dividende geben wird, hatte die Bank zuletzt noch offen gelassen.

In der Privat- und Firmenkundenbank steht nun die Integration der Postbank an. Ein Eckpunktepapier mit den Gewerkschaften und die lange erwartete Tarifeinigung bei der Postbank machen den Weg dafür frei. Für die Mannschaft im Privatkundengeschäft gibt es nun einen Kündigungsschutz bis Mitte 2021 - allerdings ist der geplante Stellenabbau damit nicht vom Tisch, er soll lediglich möglichst sozialverträglich laufen und auf freiwilligen Lösungen basieren. Die Gespräche beginnen in Kürze. Zahlen nannte die Deutsche Bank noch nicht.

Der ebenfalls konkret werdende Börsengang der Vermögensverwaltung bedeutet das Ende der Marke Sal. Oppenheim. Die 2009 im Zuge der KarstadtQuelle-Krise übernommene Privatbank wird zerschlagen. Ihr Filetstück - die quantitative Aktienanlage - wird der “Deutschen Asset Management” zugeschlagen. Diese wird damit für den Börsengang, der rund zwei Milliarden Euro in Cryans Kasse spülen soll, hübsch gemacht.

“We believe the U.S. government’s case to be flawed and materially inaccurate and we also believe that this has led the court to fall into error,” a lawyer representing Scott said.

The pair were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice last year of ‘front running’ the Cairn trade, meaning they were alleged to have profited at their client’s expense by trading before they executed Cairn’s currency order.

After losing their majority in a disastrous snap election on June 8, Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives secured support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in return for a pledge to spend an extra 1 billion pounds in Northern Ireland.

In a crowdfunded legal challenge brought by a Northern Irish citizen, lawyers argued that the deal, known as a confidence-and-supply agreement, was corrupt because it amounted to using public money to buy votes.

But after a one-day hearing, the High Court rejected their arguments and denied permission for judicial review of the deal. The judges said neither of the grounds put forward against the deal was legally arguable.

The challenge was launched by Ciaran McClean, a mental health worker and Green Party member living in Northern Ireland, who raised 92,000 pounds ($121,600) on a crowdfunding website and was present in court on Thursday.

Lawyers acting for him told the court that “the Conservative Party purchased the political support of the DUP for the sum of 1 billion pounds” and that the deal was an offence under the Bribery Act 2010.

Government lawyers responded that the public expenditure contemplated by the deal would be authorised by parliament, and that the criminal law of bribery did not apply to a confidence-and-supply agreement between political parties.

On his fundraising page, McClean had written that the Conservative-DUP deal violated Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which ended decades of armed sectarian conflict in the province.

Under the peace deal, the UK government is required to be impartial between unionists who want the province to remain part of the UK and republicans who aspire to become part of Ireland.

“The government is threatening hard-won peace with their pact with the reactionary DUP,” McClean wrote.

However, for technical legal reasons, that line of argument did not form part of the case heard by the High Court.

May, who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, inherited a narrow parliamentary majority from him.

In April 2017, with opinion polls suggesting she had a double-digit lead over the opposition Labour Party, she called a snap election, hoping to increase her majority. But after an uninspiring campaign, they lost their majority.

Tillerson said that the Trump administration backed the Geneva peace talks as the only way to end the more than six-year-old war and move to a political transition and elections.

He was speaking after holding talks with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, who announced that stalled peace talks between the Syrian government and still-to-be-united opposition would resume in Geneva on Nov. 28.

“The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,” Tillerson told reporters in the Swiss city at the end of a week-long trip that took him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan and India.

“It is our view and I have said this many times as well that we do not believe that there is a future for the Assad regime and Assad family. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.”

When the Trump administration came into office it took the view that it was “not a prerequisite that Assad goes” before the transitional process started, he added.

Supported by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Assad appears militarily unassailable and last month Assad ally Hezbollah declared victory in the Syrian war.

Those forces have pushed Islamic State back from large swathes of eastern Syria in recent months and over the past year have taken numerous pockets of rebel-held territory around Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.

Ceasefire deals brokered by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States in remaining rebel-held areas of western Syria have freed up manpower for Assad’s allies.

Tillerson called his discussions with de Mistura “fruitful” and said the United States will “continue our efforts to de-escalate the violence in Syria”.

He said the only reason Assad’s forces had succeeded in turning the tide in the war against Islamic State and other militants was “air support they have received from Russia”.

Tillerson said Iran, Assad’s other main ally, should not be seen as having made the difference in the defeat of Islamic State in Syria.

“A rigorosa disciplina na alocação de capital terá impacto direto nos fluxos de caixa futuros”, acrescentou ele.

Os investimentos da Vale somaram 863 milhões de dólares no terceiro trimestre e devem fechar ano de 2017 em 4 bilhões de dólares --a previsão de setembro para o Capex era de 4,2 bilhões de dólares, versus 5,5 bilhões em 2016.

Bush apologized through a spokesman on Wednesday for what an actress described as a sexual assault but which Bush said was intended as a friendly pat and a joke to put her at ease during a picture-taking session.

Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television network’s historical drama “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” accused Bush of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014.

The allegation surfaced in an Instagram post from Lind featuring a photograph of Bush, 93, shaking hands with former President Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturday’s hurricane fund-raising benefit.

In the post, Lind, 34, said that seeing that photo reminded her of her own meeting with the 41st president three years earlier, when, according to her, “he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.”

“He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,” Lind wrote. “He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.”

Lind said the former first lady “rolled her eyes as if to say, ‘not again.'”

The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the “MeToo” social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.

Bush’s spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a statement in response to Lind’s post that sought to explain the former president’s behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions.

Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he take pictures,” McGrath said.

“To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke - and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate,” McGrath wrote. “To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.”

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification.","LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday its key piece of Brexit legislation would be debated in parliament on Nov. 14 and 15, the next stage in what is expected to be a tortuous lawmaking process that will test Prime Minister Theresa May’s authority.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government’s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law.

But it has faced widespread criticism from lawmakers of all parties - including May’s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit.

As a result, the bill’s passage through parliament will depend on May’s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel lawmakers who said they were “deadly serious” about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit.

The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.

The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some lawmakers, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.

“Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,” a Brexit department spokeswoman said.

“We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.”

Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for “Brexit day” on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country’s laws.

He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle.

May’s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required.

DEADLY SERIOUS

Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative lawmakers to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.

One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill. “We are deadly serious,” Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.

Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer lawmakers a vote on the final exit package.

The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow lawmakers to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal.

Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification.

Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU’s preferred negotiating timetable.

Despite his clarification, lawmakers signaled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives lawmakers a greater say.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

“A aproximação da eleição faz com que sempre os votos, as posições políticas comecem a ser contagiadas. O parlamentar que busca a reeleição, ele sempre vai meditar. A proximidade com a eleição vai dificultando medidas que sejam mais custosas do ponto de vista popular? Vai dificultando sim”, afirmou.

Padilha confirmou que o governo perdeu votos na quarta-feira, durante a apreciação da denúncia contra o presidente Michel Temer, já por causa do possível impacto nas eleições de 2018. Segundo ele, alguns deputados chegaram a dizer que gostariam de votar com o governo, mas não teriam condições pelo impacto na sua base política de um voto a favor de Temer.

O governo conseguiu 251 votos -- o suficiente para arquivar a segunda denúncia contra Temer, mas nem perto dos 308 necessários para aprovar uma Proposta de Emenda à Constituição (PEC), como a reforma da Previdência.

Padilha, no entanto, insistiu que a base de apoio ao governo é de 390 votos e o resultado de quarta-feira não representa quem votaria pela reforma. A segunda denúncia apresentada pela Procuradoria-Geral da República contra Temer, pelos crimes de organização criminosa e obstrução da Justiça, também imputa o crime de organização criminosa ao próprio Padilha e a Moreira Franco, ministro da Secretaria-Geral.

“Não podemos dizer que os mesmos votos da rejeição da denúncia são os votos da Previdência. Eu cito exemplo da bancada do PSDB. São coisas diferentes”, afirmou o ministro.

Os tucanos, apesar de serem parte da base do governo e terem nas mãos quatro ministérios, deram mais votos contrários a Temer do que a favor: 23 a 20, com três ausências. Na primeira denúncia, 21 votaram contra o governo e 22 a favor. No entanto, o partido diz apoiar majoritariamente a reforma da Previdência.

Padilha defendeu que a perda de 12 votos em relação à primeira denúncia não foi uma derrota, mas estava dentro do previsto.

“Quem vota contra o governo votou. Se juntarmos aos 251 as 25 ausências, nós vamos ter 276. Foi absolutamente normal, não surpreendeu, compreendemos as razões daqueles que se ausentaram. Quem marcou presença e não votou são pessoas que não quiseram votar contra o governo”, defendeu.

Na primeira denúncia, o governo teve 263 votos a favor e 19 ausências, o que soma 282 -uma diferença de 19 votos para o placar de quarta-feira.

Os mercados financeiros reagiram com ceticismo à vitória de Temer, com temores maiores de que não haverá apoio político para tirar a reforma da Previdência do papel tão cedo. O dólar tinha leve queda pela manhã, mas ainda próximo ao patamar de 3,25 reais, o maior em mais de quatro meses. Os juros futuros, por sua vez, saltavam, enquanto a Bovespa tinha pequena alta.

Padilha, no entanto, afirmou que o governo pode sim garantir a aprovação da reforma. “O que eu tenho a dizer é que há todas as condições de se aprovar. Existe hoje uma consciência de todo o Parlamento da necessidade da reforma”, afirmou.

“Essa não é uma questão de base, a reforma não é feita em favor do governo. Temos que pensar pelo Brasil, não estamos pensando nesse governo.”

Padilha confirmou ainda que o governo irá reunir os líderes da base e o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), para definir o que será possível votar. Segundo o ministro, o fundamental continua sendo a idade mínima, transição e a igualdade das aposentadorias do setor público ao privado.",Padilha admite que eleição de 2018 pode contaminar votação de reforma da Previdência,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CV2LO-OBRTP

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

MILANO, 25 ottobre (Reuters) - Veneto Banca, in liquidazione coatta amministrativa, cederà a Trinity, società di investimento gestita da Attestor Capital, la partecipazione di controllo detenuta in Bim lanciando poi un‘Opa sull‘istituto di private banking torinese che sarà ripulito dai crediti deteriorati e ricapitalizzato.

Il prezzo iniziale offerto per il pacchetto di controllo e che sarà lo stesso per l‘Opa, pari a 0,22411 per azione, è decisamente inferiore alle quotazioni di borsa del titolo che quindi crolla a Piazza Affari.

Alle 17,00 circa Bim è in asta di volatilità dopo un ultimo prezzo di 0,61 euro, in calo del 37,56%.

L‘accordo per la cessione dell‘asset più grande rimasto in pancia all‘istituto veneto messo in liquidazione a fine giugno scorso e fuori dal perimetro rilevato (insieme ad alcuni attivi di Pop Vicenza) da Intesa Sanpaolo prevede un iniziale passaggio al fondo britannico di una quota del 68,07% per circa 24,1 milioni di euro.

Successivamente, entro due anni e al verificarsi di determinati eventi previsti dal contratto, Trinity potrà acquistare la rimanente quota del 2,606% in possesso della liquidazione.

Il prezzo potrà subire degli aggiustamenti con un meccanismo di earn-out in funzione degli utili normalizzati al 2021 ma che, nel caso della partecipazione di controllo del 68,8%, non potrà superare i 71,83 milioni, da corrispondere nel 2020.

L‘Opa che sarà lanciata dopo il closing è quindi fissata ad un prezzo unitario di 0,22411 per azione, oltre al corrispettivo derivante dall’earn-out che maturerà successivamente.

Tra gli azionisti rilevanti di Bim figura l‘ex manager Pietro D‘Aguì che detiene azioni per il 9% circa del capitale concesse in pegno a favore di Veneto Banca.

CESSIONE DETERIORATI E AUMENTO CAPITALE PER 121 MLN

Per ottenere il via libera dalle Autorità all‘acquisizione, previsto entro aprile, Trinity si è impegnato a presentare un piano industriale per Bim al 2021 che prevede il deconsolidamento dell‘intero portafoglio dei crediti deteriorati per un valore di libro lordo di circa 633 milioni attraverso una cartolarizzazione e assegnazione gratuita dei titoli junior a tutti i soci Bim.

Il piano prevede inoltre un rafforzamento patrimoniale nel 2018 per un importo complessivo di 121 milioni di euro.

Attestor aveva ottenuto l‘esclusiva per trattare sulla quota di maggioranza di Bim contesa anche dalla compagnia di riassicurazione Barents Re.

Secondo quanto riferito nei giorni scorsi da fonti vicine alla vicenda la scelta sarebbe ricaduta sull‘investment manager londinese, con fondi in gestione per circa 4 miliardi, per le maggiori garanzie offerte e una maggiore coerenza del proprio progetto con il piano industriale di Bim, a fronte di un corrispettivo più alto offerto da Barents.

Quest‘ultimo, sempre secondo le fonti, ha chiesto l‘accesso agli atti relativi alla procedura di vendita puntando ad un eventuale ricorso al Tar. Alla base della contestazione di quest‘ultima la tesi che la procedura di vendita, nell‘ambito della liquidazione della ex popolare sotto il cappello pubblico, non sia stata pienamente concorrenziale e discriminante nel prezzo.

The inclusion of Xi’s name and “thought” into the party constitution marks a major shift. In the party’s hierarchical lexicon, it puts him on par with Mao. And without younger faces in the Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s highest political organ, he is likely to wield influence for years to come. To be sure, Xi didn’t throw out the rulebook: the Politburo age limit was respected. Wang Qishan, his 69-year old ally, stepped down. At the same time the new Standing Committee includes members identified with other factions. Even so, the president’s stature today is unambiguously more powerful than a week ago.

That is not a positive economic development. Xi has never been entirely coherent or consistent on reforms. His opening speech to the party congress contained the usual mixed messages, and if anything, he seems focused on protecting party control. References to the market and economy in his speech dropped by around 20 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to his predecessor’s speech in 2012, according to a tally by Capital Economics. Mentions of the party rose more than 40 percent.

There is also an elemental tension between Xi’s efforts to aggrandize political power and promote economic liberalization. Ministerial and local government officials terrified of the centre are less likely to resist bad policy ideas, take input from the private sector or experiment with their own initiatives. A more top-down system may become less responsive to market signals, and more sensitive to the whims of individuals in the upper echelons of power.

The tension was on display at the party congress, when Xi told a member of the Guizhou provincial delegation that a local brand of liquor was “not cheap” and implied it might sell better with a price cut. The delegate thanked the president for his instructions and said she would soon act on it. “That’s a question for the market,” Xi responded. “You can’t sell it for 30 yuan just because I said so.” It’s not clear what bureaucrats should make of that, but there’s likely to be more such mixed messaging to come.",Breakingviews - Xi's new stature can overawe China's market forces,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-lineup-breakingviews/breakingviews-xis-new-stature-can-overawe-chinas-market-forces-idUSKBN1CU0QB

A data glitch forced Italy’s biggest bank by assets to publish third-quarter results two weeks ahead of schedule. Fortunately, the figures show lower costs and stronger capital. And a fee-boosting partnership with French asset manager Amundi helped offset the drag from low interest rates.

The headquarters of UniCredit bank is seen in Milan, Italy, in this February 8, 2016 file photo

For UniCredit board members who were summoned to approve the results at the crack of dawn on Tuesday, the inadvertent leak of numbers overnight was a nuisance. For investors, the preliminary figures provided early reassurance that CEO Jean Pierre Mustier’s aggressive restructuring plan is paying dividends.

The Milanese bank’s core Tier 1 capital rose to 13.5 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of September, higher than in the previous quarter and helped by the sale of asset manager Pioneer. This gives UniCredit a buffer to absorb the changes, such as the introduction of new accounting rules which force banks to provision for bad loans in a new way. That should allow it to hit Mustier’s 12.5 percent target ratio at the end of 2019.

There are other comforting signs. Quarterly income from fees was up 4 percent, demonstrating the benefits of the long-term distribution agreement with Amundi, which bought Pioneer in December. The deal allows UniCredit to rejuvenate its offering of investment products while reaping the capital gain from the sale.

Beefing up fee-generating products is a good antidote to Europe’s anaemic interest rate environment. Despite talk of an end to the easy-money phase that has squeezed banks’ traditional sources of income, there is no sign that this will happen soon – or that interest rates will rise very far when it does.

This means that even disciplined banks such as UniCredit might struggle to earn a return that exceeds their cost of capital. That will make consolidation – for example through a combination with Germany’s Commerzbank – increasingly tempting.",Breakingviews - UniCredit gets head start on recovery path,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-unicredit-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-unicredit-gets-head-start-on-recovery-path-idUSKBN1CT1MF

Wall Street has often overlooked the company’s relatively small profits as Chief Executive Jeff Bezos chases growth.

Bezos has looked to cement the company’s position as a leader in cloud services, become a formidable foe of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and disrupt the retail industry with its recent purchase of premium grocer Whole Foods.

This quarter, however, investors will want to see if Amazon’s operating income is being pressured as it cuts prices to fight competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which is investing heavily in its own online business.

“The open question for the fourth quarter is whether they will have to compete on price because Wal-Mart is making such a push into online,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a preview note.

“If their guidance for operating profit is substantially below a year ago, then that’s a signal that they intend to compete on price.”

Amazon closed its $13.7 billion Whole Foods buy on Aug. 28 and immediately slashed prices of some products at the grocer.

Analysts say the price cuts and investments in other sectors, from cloud computing to video, are likely to raise the company’s costs and reduce third-quarter operating income.

Amazon has given a wide forecast range - between operating income of $300 million and an operating loss of $400 million.

Analysts on average are expecting $144.6 million, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.

The company said in July it expected third-quarter revenue of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion. Analysts expect revenue to rise 29 percent $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Amazon’s shares were up 0.6 percent in early trading on Thursday. They have dropped 7 percent since the company reported second-quarter results on July 27.

Investors acknowledge that Amazon’s ambitions to disrupt multiple industries requires constant spending, and lower margins may not be a big concern, Barclays analysts said in their preview note.

The company’s operating costs jumped 29 percent to $32.14 billion in the third quarter of 2016.

Shareholders will also be closely watching Amazon’s holiday-quarter forecast, he said, adding that the company might forecast disappointing fourth-quarter operating income.

Amazon reported operating income of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The high level of spending is not going to slow this year either, analysts said.

Video will remain an area where Amazon spends heavily as original shows help it gain and retain subscribers. Rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) commands the online-streaming market by spending billions on original shows.

“J‘avais indiqué que notre objectif, c‘était de nous attaquer au chômage de masse, en l‘attaquant par tous les côtés”, a dit Edouard Philippe lors d‘une conférence de presse, avec à ses côtés les ministres du Travail et de l‘Education nationale, Muriel Pénicaud et Jean-Michel Blanquer.

“C‘est le sens de cet acte deux de la réforme du marché du travail dont le but est (...) d‘offrir de nouvelles protections et de vraies garanties aux actifs”, a-t-il ajouté.

La remise à plat de la formation professionnelle et de l‘apprentissage devra garantir une meilleure qualité des formations dispensées et un accès plus facile.

Le gouvernement souhaite également ouvrir le système de l‘assurance chômage aux indépendants et, une fois tous les cinq ans, aux démissionnaires. Il veut aussi jouer un rôle accru dans la gouvernance du régime.

“Beaucoup d‘études montrent qu‘environ 50% des emplois seront profondément transformés dans les dix ans qui viennent”, a expliqué Muriel Pénicaud. “Par rapport à ce défi immense, nous avons besoin de plus de simplicité, plus de rapidité”.

Edouard Philippe souhaite que le projet de loi soit adopté en conseil des Ministres avant le printemps 2018 pour être débattu dans la foulée au Parlement. Il avait auparavant dit viser une entrée en vigueur en janvier 2019.

FEUILLE DE ROUTE

Une concertation sur la réforme de l‘apprentissage impliquera tous les acteurs, comme pour la réforme du Code du travail. Des groupes de travail mis sur pied à partir de début novembre devront proposer des orientations d‘ici janvier 2018.

Muriel Pénicaud veut notamment améliorer l‘articulation entre lycées professionnels et centres d‘apprentissage, revoir la carte des formations en fonction des besoins des branches et des entreprises et simplifier le mode de financement.

La formation professionnelle devrait être l‘objet d‘une négociation interprofessionnelle, comme le souhaitent les partenaires sociaux. Patronat et syndicats devront donc s‘entendre sur les modalités d‘application de la réforme.

Ils recevront une lettre de cadrage du gouvernement leur indiquant les grandes orientations dans une quinzaine de jours, pour que les discussions démarrent à la mi-novembre.

Le gouvernement mènera en parallèle des concertations avec les régions sur ce sujet.

Les discussions sur la réforme de l‘assurance chômage, qui devraient débuter fin novembre pour se terminer en janvier, commenceront par une rencontre multilatérale, conformément au souhait des partenaires sociaux.

Mais il n‘est pas possible à ce stade, selon le gouvernement de préciser si la suite prendra la forme de négociations ou de concertations. “Sur l‘assurance chômage, on est sur un terrain plus nouveau (...) Il faut d‘abord qu‘on pose des hypothèses, un diagnostic”, a expliqué Muriel Pénicaud.

En plus de l‘ouverture du régime aux indépendants et démissionnaires, elle entend lutter contre le travail précaire par un système de type bonus-malus pour décourager l‘abus de contrats courts et encourager les contrats à durée indéterminée (CDI). Elle dit aussi vouloir améliorer le contrôle de la recherche d‘emploi.

CLIMAT SOCIAL TENDU

La plupart des organisations syndicales, tenues partiellement au courant du format des futures rencontres, s‘étaient montrées satisfaites.

“Si ça se passe comme on nous l‘a dit, ça devrait mieux se passer que la dernière fois”, avait dit le secrétaire général de la CGT, Philippe Martinez, à l‘issue d‘un entretien avec le Premier ministre, la ministre du Travail et le ministre de l‘Education.

Mais ces réformes arrivent dans un climat social tendu. La CGT, Solidaires et des syndicats étudiants, suivis cette fois par Force ouvrière, ont annoncé mardi une nouvelle journée de mobilisation contre la politique “libérale” d‘Emmanuel Macron.

CFDT, CFTC, Unsa et Fage ont, elles, envoyé une mise en garde au gouvernement, l‘exhortant à “prendre en compte les inquiétudes, alimentées par certaines mesures” comme la baisse des aides au logement ou la réforme de l‘impôt sur la fortune.

Moody’s downgraded Russia’s rating to below investment grade in early 2015 as Russia’s economy slipped into recession amid a rapid drop in oil prices and Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the Ukrainian crisis.

Moody’s confirmed the Ba1 rating two years later, in February this year, when it also revised its rating outlook to stable from negative.

In an interview with Reuters, Kristin Lindow said Moody’s rating outlook has a time horizon of 12-18 months before the agency may consider the next rating action.

In Russia’s case it is likely to be closer to 18 months, said Lindow, who is in charge of the country’s sovereign ratings.

“We’re looking for those structural reforms that have been delayed by the political cycle over the last several years to begin to be implemented in order to move upward with the rating.”

Moody’s improved the outlook to stable as Russia was proceeding with structural reforms. The central bank convinced the market the rouble will remain a free-floating currency, while the finance ministry this year started buying dollars for its reserves when prices for oil, Russia’s key exports, stay above $40 per barrel.

Lindow said the latest economic crisis in Russia “was not wasted” in the sense that it helped Russia to undertake reforms that might not have taken in good times.

“The mix of policies, monetary, fiscal, the exchange rate policy, reduce the dependence on high oil prices, reduce the volatility of that income and therefore diminish the inherent volatility of the economy,” Lindow said.

But without further reforms, such as a reduction of state ownership in the economy and higher retirement age, the Russian economy is seen growing by only around 1.5 percent a year over the next several years, Lindow said.

Moody’s economic forecasts are worse than expectations voiced by the Russian authorities. The Russian central bank said last month it revised gross domestic product growth for 2017 to up to 2.2 percent, up from 1-1.5 percent expected in early 2017.

Lindow said a stronger GDP growth this year could be a one-off.

“Growth of 2 percent plus is not expected to be sustained. The economy may pay for higher growth this year with lower growth next year.”

Even if the Russian economy is getting more stable and grows further, it would not be enough to meaningfully reduce poverty and curtail income differentials among households, Lindow said.",Russia's economic recovery not enough for higher rating: Moody's,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-ratings-moody-s/russias-economic-recovery-not-enough-for-higher-rating-moodys-idINKBN1CV2BT

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

Metronome is a bitcoin-like token that upon its launch in early December can be used immediately for a slew of applications such as payments and transfers.
Upon the launch in December, an initial supply of 10 million MTN tokens will be issued, with 8 million MTN tokens sold to the public in a descending price auction for Ethereum’s ether currency.

Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that has underpinned bitcoin, the original digital currency.

Metronome is a bitcoin-like token that upon its launch in early December can be used immediately for a slew of applications such as payments and transfers. It can also run on different blockchains, unlike other tokens, the company said.

“This is a foundational crypto-currency, a foundational payment layer,” Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of Bloq, said in an interview with Reuters.

”How is it different from bitcoin or ethereum? It is this cross-chain, or multi-chain, ability, to move from one railroad to another. That’s a really big innovation and invention of Metronome.

Upon the launch in December, an initial supply of 10 million MTN tokens will be issued, with 8 million MTN tokens sold to the public in a descending price auction for Ethereum’s ether currency. The idea for the auction is to manage supply, Roszak said.

Ethereum is another blockchain similar to that of bitcoin,

Bloq will keep 2 million of the tokens. Roszak said the company will not receive the proceeds of the MTN sale. They will remain within the Metronome smart contract system to provide liquidity to the token’s marketplace.

“When you buy a Metronome token, you are funding a savings contract that will provide liquidity and price support for the Metronome token economy. That’s a big difference,” Roszak said.

The Bloq executive also pointed out that unlike other token offerings, there would be no pre-sale of the tokens to institutional investors prior to the December offering.

“It’s going to be a fair auction. Nobody has an advantage before the launch,” Roszak said.

According to financial data and research firm Pitchbook, Bloq raised an undisclosed amount of money from SixThirty, a business development accelerator and venture fund, in September 2016.

The company raised $250,000 of venture funding from Digital Currency Group and Tally Capital in February 2016, Pitchbook said.",U.S. blockchain start-up Bloq to launch bitcoin-like token,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bloq-token-funding/u-s-blockchain-start-up-bloq-to-launch-bitcoin-like-token-idUSKBN1CT2G1

After-hours television was built around the set-piece interview and guest appearance when Letterman's ""Late Night"" broke the mold in 1982 with absurd pranks and send-ups. Everyday viewers went on his show to present ""stupid pet tricks."" Behind his desk, Letterman could be serious, dry and cerebral. But he often volunteered for oddball pranks. In one well-known stunt, he worked a shift at a Taco Bell in suburban New Jersey, taking pickup orders. In another sketch, Letterman was dunked in water while covered in Alka Seltzer tablets.

Scientists said on Thursday an analysis of fossilized feathers on the dinosaur called Sinosauropteryx revealed a camouflage pattern that included the bandit mask, a light-colored underbelly, dark-colored back and a striped tail.

Its color pattern also hinted at the environment Sinosauropteryx inhabited: an open savannah rather than a forest, the researchers believe.

“This was quite a surprising discovery,” paleontologist Fiann Smithwick of the University of Bristol in Britain said of the bandit mask.

That feature may have given Sinosauropteryx certain advantages. In birds, the evolutionary descendants of dinosaurs, a bandit mask pattern often obscures the eyes. Predators and prey look for eyes as a giveaway of an animal’s presence, Smithwick said.

“The color patterns we found are all known to be associated with camouflage in modern animals, and so it is likely that Sinosauropteryx was under strong predation pressure as well as needing to hide from its own prey. It was likely both the hunter and the hunted,” Smithwick added.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip

Sinosauropteryx measured about 3.5 feet (1 meter) long, was two-legged with short arms, large thumbs and a very long tail, and was covered in filament-like feathers. Previous research indicated its dark feathers were brownish-red. It possessed small, sharp teeth, and ate small vertebrates like lizards.

“It would have looked like a skinny version of a raccoon mixed with a turkey,” said University of Bristol molecular paleobiologist Jakob Vinther.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip

Scientists’ ability in recent years to identify color patterns in fossilized dinosaur skin and feathers has boosted the understanding of these bygone creatures.

The camouflage pattern seen on the side of Sinosauropteryx’s body is called countershading, which helps animals blend in with the background.

Animals inhabiting open environments like savannahs often have a countershading pattern like that of Sinosauropteryx that transitions dramatically from dark to light high on the side of the body, the researchers said. Forest animals typically have countershading that changes from dark to light much lower and more gradually on the side of the body.

“We know that at least two other dinosaurs had countershading, neither of which were feathered, so it seems that it was a common color pattern,” Smithwick said.

The Republican-controlled House, overcoming last-minute resistance from some lawmakers in their own ranks as well as united Democratic opposition, voted 216-212 to pass a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, a measure that will make approval of an eventual tax bill easier in the Senate.

Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate last year, has asked Congress to pass the tax legislation by the end of the year. Trump, who took office in January, is still looking for a first major legislative win even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, having failed to secure a promised repeal of the Obamacare law.

The White House and Republican congressional leaders unveiled a broad outline of the tax proposal last month but detailed legislation is not due to be made public until next week.

Twenty Republicans voted against the budget measure, including several from high-tax states where many voters would be hurt by a provision of the Trump tax plan that would repeal the deduction for state and local tax payments, as well as some conservatives.

The budget plan will enable the 100-seat Senate to pass tax legislation with a simple majority rather than a 60 vote super-majority. This higher bar would be tough to reach given Democratic opposition.

Republicans hold a comfortable majority in the House but just a 52-48 margin in the Senate. Democrats have called the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would swell the federal deficit.

The White House and congressional Republicans excluded Democrats as they developed the plan, and it appears unlikely that any significant number of Democrats will get behind the proposal.

“By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the American people, real tax reform is on the way,” Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said in debate on the House floor before the vote.

The Republican tax outline calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

Eliminating the state and local tax deduction, one of a series of measures to offset lost tax revenues, would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and could remain an obstacle for some Republicans during debate on the tax measure.

During debate on the budget plan on the House floor, Republican Peter Roskam of Illinois called the state and local tax deduction a “nettlesome issue.”

“I‘m of the view that tax reform does not simply mean redistribution of tax liability from one part of the country to another, but it means tax relief for everybody,” Roskam said.

‘SILVER SPOON’

Independent analysts last month forecast that corporations and the wealthiest Americans would benefit the most and many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes under the tax outline unveiled by the Republicans.

“Right here before our eyes, in this House, the Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoon of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the middle class. That is the fact,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said during the debate.

Independent analysts said the proposal would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade.

The battle within Trump’s own party over the state and local income tax deduction offers a preview of the tough fights ahead as Republicans seek to do away with other popular tax breaks.

Another area of dispute is the possibility of scaling back a popular tax-deferred U.S. retirement savings program in order to raise revenue to pay for the sweeping tax cuts.

Trump and Brady reopened the door on Wednesday to capping annual contributions into these 401(k) plans, which for four decades have helped millions of Americans save for retirement.","U.S. House passes budget plan, paving way for tax cut legislation",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tax/u-s-house-passes-budget-plan-paving-way-for-tax-cut-legislation-idINKBN1CV1A9

The reprieve comes ahead of Europe’s MiFID II trading rules, which will overhaul how investment managers pay for research provided by banks beginning in January.

Under MiFID II, brokers will have to charge separately for research, instead of bundling the fees together with other services, such as trading.

The new rules aim to eliminate conflicts of interest by giving investors greater transparency over how much they pay banks for discrete services.

EU regulators say this should incentivize brokers to produce better quality research and allow investors to execute trades with banks that offer the best price.

Some global investment banks risk losing up to $240 million (£188 million) in business by 2020 under the new rules, according to financial consultancy Quinlan & Associates.

Many global U.S. brokers servicing European clients will need to comply with the EU rules, but are technically barred from doing so due to a quirk of U.S. federal securities law. This sparked concerns that U.S. brokers would have to overhaul their operations to continue serving European clients, or EU investors would lose access to valuable U.S. research.

On Thursday, the SEC issued three so-called ‘no action relief’ letters that will allow U.S. market participants to comply with the rules in a way that is consistent with U.S. law, the regulator said.

The letters were drawn up following discussion with the European Union and will allow the SEC more time to assess how, if at all, it can reconcile its rules with MiFID.

“Today’s no-action relief was designed...to reduce confusion and operational difficulties that might arise in the transition to MiFID II’s research provisions,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.

“These steps should preserve investor access to research in the near term, during which the Commission can assess the need for any further action.”

Because U.S. and EU firms are the biggest participants in each others’ markets, MiFID has caused a slew of cross-border compliance issues for U.S. firms and trading platforms across a range of asset classes.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it had reached a preliminary deal with the European Union to recognize each others’ derivatives rules under MiFID II.",U.S. securities regulator grants Wall Street EU research rules reprieve,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-mifid/u-s-securities-regulator-grants-wall-street-eu-research-rules-reprieve-idUSKBN1CV1SK

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

Indian authorities have faced criticism for weak law enforcement over a spate of recent attacks on foreign tourists, particularly women.

In Sunday’s incident, the boys made lewd comments to Quentin Jeremy Clerc and his friend Marie Droz as they strolled by a train station, asked for selfies and then at some point began pelting them with stones, the Times of India newspaper said.

The attack left 24-year-old Clerc with a fractured skull and a blood clot in his brain while Droz suffered a broken arm, it added.

One man has been arrested over the attack, a police officer told Reuters by telephone from Agra.

Police had registered a case and expected to make more arrests, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

Reuters could not immediately reach the couple to seek comment.

Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said she had asked for a report from authorities in Uttar Pradesh, the state of which Agra is a part.

“I have asked for a report from the state government. My officers will reach them (the couple) in the hospital,” Swaraj said in a message on social network Twitter.

India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the issue.

Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice.

Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary.

“For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.”

Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters.

Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans.

The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.

General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.”

Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather.

One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state.",Alphabet looks to snowy Michigan to test self-driving cars,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CV1SN-OCABS

Drugmakers are particularly affected by Brexit because of the highly regulated nature of their business.

Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said drug companies needed clarity on future relations with the EU as soon as possible to minimise disruption to medicine supplies and repeated her earlier plea for a transition period of at least two years.

Although the impact of Brexit on GSK’s overall business will not be material, as Britain accounts for only 4 percent of sales, GSK needs fall-back arrangements, including a way to retest UK-manufactured batches of drugs shipped to Europe.

“It is mainly related to the construction of new testing facilities across Europe and potential preparations for licence changes as well,” Walmsley said of the company’s contingency planning.

“All of that work is underway in the detailed planning group, and we will be ready for it as necessary.”

She made her comments to reporters after announcing quarterly results on Wednesday.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

The comment by Scott Jones, an assistant deputy minister at Canada’s Communications Security Establishment intelligence agency, follows a warning on Friday from the United States that sophisticated hackers are targeting U.S. infrastructure, including nuclear, energy, aviation, water and manufacturing industries.

“Targeted attacks on Canadian infrastructure is something we are really worried about,” Jones said in an interview at the Reuters Cyber Security Summit in Toronto.

“Do we think something’s going to happen tomorrow? No,” Jones said. “Is it technically possible? Yes, and that’s what we’re worried about.”

Jones said Canada had seen a level of hacking activity that was “comparable” to what had been reported in the United States.

Jones said the government rarely goes public when it uncovers hacking activity because that would let attackers know they had been caught. Instead, it quietly reaches out to targeted firms.

“We try to do it very quietly to help the company become more resilient,” he said. “We’d like to try to give the defenders as much advantage as we can.”

“We’ve yet to suffer a massive critical infrastructure attack and we’ve yet to suffer a massive loss of capability,” he said, explaining why many firms have not invested in boosting cyber defenses.

He warned that some 60 nations currently have the ability to conduct offensive cyber warfare operations, including ones that could harm the grid and other infrastructure.

Five years ago, only about five nations had that capability, he added.

CSE’s Jones said the potential for cyber attacks to harm critical infrastructure has diminished over the past two years because private companies now take the threat much more seriously.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CV2RF-OCATP

The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed up 0.5 percent, its best day in a week as dollar-earning stocks got a boost from a falling pound after the worst plunge in retail sales since 2008.

British stocks did not however fully join in the strong rally among European equities, boosted by a weaker euro after the European Central Bank committed to extending asset purchases until at least September 2018.

Barclays (BARC.L) was the standout faller, its shares down 7.4 percent to their lowest in a year, after the bank missed estimates for third-quarter profit on the back of weak trading performance at its investment banking division.

Barclays has been the worst-performing bank on the FTSE 100 this year, down 18.6 percent year-to-date.

Barclays’ results contrasted with Lloyds’ (LLOY.L), whose shares ended Wednesday’s session with a slight gain despite an initial wobble.

“The main thing (with Barclays) is there’s been a big drop in the income from the investment bank, which is more of a market-wide issue ... and probably a bit of sideways movement in the rest of the business,” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.

“It’s a bit of a damp squib of a set of results.”

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) shares fell 3.4 percent, extending Wednesday’s post-results losses to hit their lowest since the Brexit vote aftermath, after Credit Suisse cut its target price on the pharma stock.

Analysts at the Swiss bank pointed to uncertainty over Glaxo’s HIV segment ViiV and said the company’s post-results call was more cautious than expected.

Healthcare firm Shire (SHP.L) fell 2.1 percent despite earlier receiving European approval for its drug Firazyr to be extended to paediatric patients.

Shore Capital analysts put the drop down to a profit warning from U.S. biotech company Celgene (CELG.O).

“Celgene has been a bellwether for the sector,” said ShoreCap analyst Tara Raveendran.

Among mid and small-caps, Spire Health (SPI.L) shares also fell 3.2 percent and Biotech Growth Trust (BIOGW.L) dropped 4 percent.

Analytics and information firm RELX (REL.L) meanwhile gained 3 percent after a trading update analysts said was in line with expectations.

Foreign-earning consumer goods stocks British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L) added the most points to the index, while miners Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Anglo American (AAL.L) and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) also supported.

Galliford Try (GFRD.L) and Barratt Development (BDEV.L) shares fell as they went ex-dividend.

So far the British third-quarter results season has been marred by significant share price drops from large-cap firms such as Convatec (CTEC.L) and Whitbread (WTB.L), as well as profit warnings from small-caps Pendragon (PDG.L) and Dialight (DIAL.L) earlier in the week.

“If you look at UK domestic firms, there’s quite a lot of bad news that’s expected because Brexit is hanging over results,” Hargeaves Lansdown’s Khalaf said.

Estimates from Morgan Stanley show earnings are expected to grow by more than 20 percent in the United Kingdom in 2017, against 12.6 percent growth for MSCI Europe.

A high proportion of Britain’s earnings growth is driven by the heavyweight energy sector, however, and is also helped by a weaker pound.

Last week marked the 138th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market.

Other reports on Thursday, however, offered a less favorable look at the economy. The goods trade deficit widened in September and retail inventories fell, prompting the Atlanta Federal Reserve to trim its third-quarter GDP growth estimate. In addition, signed contracts to buy previously-owned homes were unchanged last month.

“Firms remain unwilling to release labor. The labor market is very tight,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 223,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since March 1973.

Economists had forecast claims rising to 235,000 in the latest week. They have declined from the almost three-year high of 298,000 hit at the start of September in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.

The impact of Harvey and Irma has largely dropped out of the claims data for the mainland United States. But Irma and Hurricane Maria continue to impact claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, now virtually isolated because of the destruction of infrastructure due to the storms.

A Labor Department official said claims data for the islands had continued to be estimated.

Last week marked the 138th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,000 to 239,500 last week.

That suggests a sharp rebound in job growth in October after nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September.

LABOR MARKET SLACK DIMINISHING

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 3,000 to 1.90 million in the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 1.90 million, the lowest reading since January 1974. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which October’s unemployment rate will be derived.

The four-week average of continuing claims fell 40,500 between the September and October survey weeks, suggesting a further improvement in the unemployment rate as labor market slack continues to diminish. The job market strength supports the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the European Central Bank’s announcement that it would extend its bond purchases at a reduced rate. The dollar .DXY rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were largely unchanged. Stocks on Wall Street rose.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit rose 1.3 percent to $64.1 billion in September. Exports of goods increased $0.9 billion to $129.6 billion. Goods imports gained $1.7 billion to $193.7 billion amid a surge in capital and consumer goods imports, which likely reflects the economy’s underlying strength.

The Commerce Department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent last month. But stocks of goods at retailers tumbled 1.0 percent, weighed down by a 2.6 percent dive in motor vehicle inventories. As a result, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate.

“The higher-than-expected trade deficit implies a lower contribution from the net exports,” said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. “In addition, today’s weak inventories data also imply a lower contribution from this subcomponent.”

The government will publish it’s advance estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the April-June quarter.

A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed its pending home sale index was unchanged at more than a 2-1/2-year low in September.

Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.
In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule.
Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question.","When Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt announced last week that his agency would repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Trump administration’s allies in the Republican Party and the coal industry hailed it as a major blow against over-regulation. Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

House Speaker Paul Ryan already sounded a bit triumphant on Tuesday when he said Congress was “on the verge of doing something that is going to make a big difference for so many families.” On Thursday, his chamber is expected to approve a Senate budget resolution that would allow tax cuts to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. The House had initially approved a plan that didn’t allow for any such additions.

Independent tax analysts expect the White House-backed reform plan will add $2 trillion to $5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. But proposals to offset tax cuts are already facing opposition. On Monday, Trump tweeted his rejection to proposals that would cap tax-deferred employee contributions to 401(k) retirement accounts to $2,400 a year. Currently, workers up to 50 years old can contribute up to $18,000 a year. Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch said Congress may disagree with the president on some of these issues.

Trump also expressed doubt about a Republican option to add a fourth tax bracket for the top wealthy earners, which could leave them paying as much or more than they do now. At the same time, Republicans are squabbling over a proposal to repeal deductions for state and local taxes, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.

Resolving the differences was never going to be easy. Trump may have complicated the task on Tuesday when he tweeted fresh insults at Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has been skeptical about the tax effort.

So financial markets were stunned this week when the government unveiled a plan to pump a larger-than-expected $32.4 billion into state-run lenders, sending Indian equity markets soaring to record highs.

A tough political calendar and an economic downturn that threatens his party’s electoral prospects had, in the end, left Modi little choice but to act.

The tipping point, according to a source close to the prime minister, came close to home: growing evidence that small and medium sized business in Gujarat, a core constituency in the state that elected Modi chief minister and propelled him on to the national stage in 2014, were being starved of credit.

“Gujarat is not a poor state, we cannot just dole some benefits: business has to be up and running in Gujarat,” the Modi aide said.

Modi was already facing criticism from some businesses for the disruption to the economy caused by the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year and the roll-out of a new national goods and services tax (GST).

Compounding the woes, business owners in his home state were telling Modi they could not get credit from banks, the aide said, a problem being felt throughout the country as state-run lenders struggle to tackle a record $145 billion in sour loans.

Gujarat will hold state elections in December.

ELECTORAL TESTS

The warnings from Gujarat crystallised the political reality facing Modi - in the months ahead 12 Indian states go to the polls, and the outcomes will set the stage for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) bid for re-election in 2019.

The series of electoral tests comes as the economy has slowed to its slackest pace of growth in three years.

While many analysts praise the Modi government’s economic reforms, they say it has been less successful in creating jobs - a key consideration in a country where millions of young people join the workforce each year - as small businesses that create the bulk of employment have been hit hard.

The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think-tank, estimates about 2 million jobs have been lost in 2017, after the cash ban and the rollout of GST.

“There is negative attitude around the onslaught of reforms that have been rolled out in the last year,” said Sunil Parekh, a strategic adviser to large industrial groups in Gujarat, adding that “resentment is very high in the state”.

“The bank recapitalisation is not stimulus for micro, medium and small enterprises, but what it does is it eases their stress and gives banks a fresh opportunity to lend to distressed firms, as they try to improve their business.”

Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik said there was no connection between the bank recapitalisation plan and any state election.

“This package is not for one state and is for the long-term benefit of the economy,” he said.

NO SILVER BULLET

The $32.4 billion capital infusion is a step Modi’s government had long been reluctant to take, despite pressure from economists and the Reserve Bank of India to act.

Modi has made prudent fiscal stewardship a key plank of his platform after the previous Congress-led government’s inability to curb spending was widely seen contributing to India’s worst economic crisis in more than two decades in 2013.

The government, according to the aide, was also reluctant to be seen as rewarding banks for reckless lending.

But the move carries risks for the government, since there is no guarantee that the injections will spur credit growth. Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks need as much as $65 billion in additional capital by March 2019 just to meet new global regulatory rules.

Yet having decided to roll the dice, a series of critical decisions now loom. Chief among them is how the injection will be structured, with the bulk expected to come in the form of so-called recapitalisation bonds sold directly to banks.

The government will also need to figure out how to account for the injection so it does not increase the country’s fiscal deficit - for example, by funding it through state-owned agencies.

Investors and commentators such as former central bank deputy governor H.R. Khan say the recapitalisation needs to be accompanied by strong banking sector reforms to ensure there is no repeat of the lax lending practices that caused the problem.

If the plan goes wrong, Modi could end up “owning” an issue the government has until now blamed on the previous Congress administration.

“The biggest risk is always implementation,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder of financial firm Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. “If this kind of infusion is not done in a timely manner, it will end up being useless.”

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

Other reports on Thursday, however, offered a less favorable look at the economy. The goods trade deficit widened in September and retail inventories fell, prompting the Atlanta Federal Reserve to trim its third-quarter GDP growth estimate. In addition, signed contracts to buy previously-owned homes were unchanged last month.

“Firms remain unwilling to release labor. The labor market is very tight,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 223,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since March 1973.

Economists had forecast claims rising to 235,000 in the latest week. They have declined from the almost three-year high of 298,000 hit at the start of September in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.

The impact of Harvey and Irma has largely dropped out of the claims data for the mainland United States. But Irma and Hurricane Maria continue to impact claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, now virtually isolated because of the destruction of infrastructure due to the storms.

A Labor Department official said claims data for the islands had continued to be estimated.

Last week marked the 138th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,000 to 239,500 last week.

That suggests a sharp rebound in job growth in October after nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September.

LABOR MARKET SLACK DIMINISHING

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 3,000 to 1.90 million in the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 1.90 million, the lowest reading since January 1974. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which October’s unemployment rate will be derived.

The four-week average of continuing claims fell 40,500 between the September and October survey weeks, suggesting a further improvement in the unemployment rate as labor market slack continues to diminish. The job market strength supports the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the European Central Bank’s announcement that it would extend its bond purchases at a reduced rate. The dollar .DXY rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were largely unchanged. Stocks on Wall Street rose.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit rose 1.3 percent to $64.1 billion in September. Exports of goods increased $0.9 billion to $129.6 billion. Goods imports gained $1.7 billion to $193.7 billion amid a surge in capital and consumer goods imports, which likely reflects the economy’s underlying strength.

The Commerce Department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent last month. But stocks of goods at retailers tumbled 1.0 percent, weighed down by a 2.6 percent dive in motor vehicle inventories. As a result, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate.

“The higher-than-expected trade deficit implies a lower contribution from the net exports,” said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. “In addition, today’s weak inventories data also imply a lower contribution from this subcomponent.”

The government will publish it’s advance estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the April-June quarter.

A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed its pending home sale index was unchanged at more than a 2-1/2-year low in September.

Em Kisumu, cidade do oeste do país, jovens que atenderam a um pedido de boicote dos eleitores feito pelo líder opositor Raila Odinga atiraram pedras e foram recebidos com tiros de munição real, gás lacrimogêneo e canhões de água.

Um manifestante morreu e três ficaram feridos, segundo uma enfermeira local. A Reuters não encontrou nenhuma zona eleitoral aberta.

Quase 50 pessoas foram mortas por forças de segurança desde a votação original de agosto, que Kenyatta venceu, mas que foi anulada pela Suprema Corte devido a irregularidades processuais.

A eleição está sendo acompanhada atentamente em todo o leste da África, que conta com o Quênia como polo comercial e logístico, e no Ocidente, que considera Nairóbi um anteparo contra a militância islâmica da Somália e os conflitos civis no Sudão do Sul e Burundi.

Embora tenham surgido tensões em alguns bastiões da oposição, em outras áreas a situação estava calma.

O ministro do Interior, Fred Matiang‘i, disse à Citizen TV que as zonas eleitorais abriram em quase 90 por cento do país, incluindo Kiambu, onde Kenyatta votou.

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

President Xi Jinping further consolidated his personal power during this week’s party congress, as the CCP turns back toward more autocratic government. For Westerners who argued that engagement was preferable to containment, it marks a galling moment. China has not changed politically the way liberals argued it had to, nor has its economy collapsed the way some predicted it would, absent deeper reform. Those left standing are hawks who argue that China’s model works, and is a threat. To them, letting China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 was an historic mistake.

At that time, advocates of inclusion argued it would set off a virtuous cycle of reform and wealth creation. As money trickled into the pockets of the middle class, those citizens would inevitably demand, and receive, more political freedoms. For a while, that was exactly what happened. Society opened up, the private sector revived, and foreign investment poured in. Nearly 300 million Chinese people emerged from poverty in the 1980s and 1990s.

In retrospect there was nothing inevitable about it. Reform depended heavily on the political will of reformist leaders like Premier Zhu Rongji. But the party’s willingness to keep taking tough economic medicine faded over time. China’s list of unmet WTO commitments remains long.

The middle class seems indifferent. Reports on Chinese college students abroad focus on their nationalism, their defence of their government, and their disdain for dissidents. Popular protests focus on local concerns like pollution or fraud, not votes or free speech.

China’s economic imbalances will probably force a future day of reckoning. But as far as Xi is concerned, the current political and economic controls in place are necessary for Party supremacy, even if they hurt competitiveness, or foreign relations. The rest of the world can like this, or not, but whatever the doubts about its viability, a disruptive China looks like part of the new status quo.",Breakingviews - China’s autocracy puts end to reform illusions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-autocracy-puts-end-to-reform-illusions-idUSKBN1CU19V

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

Bush apologized through a spokesman on Wednesday for what an actress described as a sexual assault but which Bush said was intended as a friendly pat and a joke to put her at ease during a picture-taking session.

Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television network’s historical drama “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” accused Bush of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014.

The allegation surfaced in an Instagram post from Lind featuring a photograph of Bush, 93, shaking hands with former President Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturday’s hurricane fund-raising benefit.

In the post, Lind, 34, said that seeing that photo reminded her of her own meeting with the 41st president three years earlier, when, according to her, “he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.”

“He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,” Lind wrote. “He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.”

Lind said the former first lady “rolled her eyes as if to say, ‘not again.'”

The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the “MeToo” social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.

Bush’s spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a statement in response to Lind’s post that sought to explain the former president’s behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions.

Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he take pictures,” McGrath said.

“To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke - and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate,” McGrath wrote. “To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.”

Xi’s official portrait dominated the People’s Daily’s front page report on the unveiling of the party’s new top leadership. Below that was a smaller group photograph of the new top leadership - the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Xi.

It is a stark departure from recent precedent, with Mao Zedong the last leader to be granted such status on the front page after the party conclave - which is held once every five years.

The People’s Daily did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Deng Xiaoping introduced collective leadership three decades ago to ward off the rise of another Mao-like cult of personality, the official portraits of all newly-selected Politburo Standing Committee members have been presented together on the front page in a grid.

The portrait of the party’s top leader, the general secretary, is usually only slightly more prominent; reflecting his position as the first among equals.

Xi is the party’s general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and president of the country.

In Thursday’s People’s Daily, the portraits and biographical information of the six other standing committee members - Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng - were relegated to the inside pages.

“That’s definitely the first time since Mao,” said Ryan Manuel, a China expert at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Xi’s oversized portrait on the front of the paper.

The People’s Daily is closely parsed by party cadres and others, and sets the tone for media coverage in state-run newspapers at the provincial level.

Manuel said the paper closely followed regimented rules and norms and would have done so especially meticulously for its “most important front page in five years”.

“It’s a strict system,” he said. “The rules of placement and the rules of what type of photos you put on there are incredibly tightly argued and defined.”

Xi’s status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao was underlined on Wednesday when the party, in another break with precedent, revealed a new leadership line-up without naming an obvious successor to him.

There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of the customary second five-year term in power, which ends in 2022.

During the congress, Xi became the first leader since Mao to have a political ideology bearing his name enshrined in the party’s constitution while in office.","On front page of China's flagship paper, Xi gets Mao-like prominence",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-congress-media/on-front-page-of-chinas-flagship-paper-xi-gets-mao-like-prominence-idUKKBN1CV11T

The initiative comes after dozens of allegations of sexual harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein inspired hundreds of thousands of women around the world to share their own experiences on social media under the hashtag #MeToo.

The new website, LabourToo, aims to gather information about what may have been going on behind the scenes to encourage the party to reinforce its policies on sexual harassment and change its cultural norms.

“It isn’t about naming and shaming, it’s about putting pressure on a party that has a strong public stance on gender equality to apply those principles to the way it runs itself,” wrote one of the founders in an article on the Guardian website.

Writing anonymously, the author, an elected local councillor, said she had personally experienced sexual assault by a fellow party member who held a position of responsibility.

“When I reported this, I expected to find support from my party. Instead, I had to ... face the direct suggestion that I might not want to pursue my complaint if I wanted a future in Labour,” she wrote.

The author said the person who assaulted her was removed from their position, but those who had covered up the incident remained in post and she was still being harassed as a result of having reported what had happened.

“My complaint was swept under the carpet, and the perpetrators continue to play a part in my everyday life within the party,” she wrote.

Several prominent female Labour members of parliament, including former acting party leader Harriet Harman, have voiced support for the new initiative on Twitter.

“All Parties need whistleblower system. LabourToo,” wrote Harman.

Fellow Labour lawmaker Stella Creasy tweeted her support for the writer of the Guardian article.

“This powerful testimony is why we have to put our own house in order to be party of equality,” she wrote.

A party spokeswoman said Labour took all complaints of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination extremely seriously.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand.

The country is selling $2 billion of five-and 10-year sovereign dollar bonds, the first such issue since 2004.

China does not need the money, but the borrowing serves multiple purposes. It helps stabilise cross-border capital flows, refills hard-currency reserves, and makes it easier for companies to refinance in dollars, since there will now be benchmark issues to price against. It is also a rebuke to the credit rating agencies, showing China can brush aside their warnings.

It is already a banner year for offshore fundraising. Thomson Reuters IFR says Chinese issuers have sold $108 billion of overseas bonds in dollars, euros and yen by the end of September, already 24 percent above 2016’s full-year record.

For all the hype about the international yuan, it’s naturally easier for Chinese companies to use dollars for overseas acquisitions. Ditto for “Belt and Road” infrastructure investments. But appetite for dollars has come at the expense of the offshore yuan market, once a policy priority. The Ministry of Finance is only selling 14 billion yuan ($2 billion) of so-called “dim sum” bonds in Hong Kong this year, half of the previous year’s issuance.

Even so, this is an unrated issue by a country infamous for credit-fuelled growth, weak rule of law, and selective respect for international norms. It’s one thing to lend money to the Chinese government, but this will serve as a benchmark for pricing debt sales by other Chinese borrowers, some of them far more opaque.

The MoF has previously manipulated offshore bond sales by force-feeding them to compliant Chinese banks. This simulates demand without market substance. This time around, however, the securities may attract more foreign interest: as the mainland economy has recovered, foreign anxiety has genuinely eased.

Adaire Fox-Martin, SAP executive board member in charge of global customer operations, told Reuters on Thursday an ongoing probe by its law firm, Baker McKenzie, had uncovered wrongdoing related to sales commissions paid to entities linked to South Africa’s powerful Gupta family to win deals dating back to 2014.

The Gupta family are friends of President Jacob Zuma who have been accused of unduly influencing the awarding of state tenders. The family has denied any wrongdoing and says it is a victim of a politically-driven witch hunt.

SAP said in a statement it paid $7.7 million in commissions to Gupta-related companies between December 2014 and November 2016 in connection with contracts worth $48 million to sell software to South African state firms, Transnet and Eskom.

“We are disappointed SAP has let down South Africa: its communities, our employees, the partners we work with in South Africa and, importantly, our customers here,” Fox-Martin said by phone from Johannesburg.

It said preliminary findings from the probe had led SAP to take disciplinary action against three top managers whom it originally put on leave in July after media reports alleged SAP paid kickbacks to win government contracts. The probe found no evidence SAP paid bribes to government officials.

South Africa’s opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) said it had filed a criminal complaint against SAP’s local unit for alleged money laundering and corruption.

”Following SAP’s admission today, the police have an obligation to investigate fully and to leave no stone unturned,” the Democratic Alliance’s Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone said in a statement.

Mazzone called on SAP to aid the police: “It is high time that those who have been involved in selling our country to the highest bidder are brought to book. SAP must hand over any and all information that may have bearing on the investigation.”

U.S. PROBE; SOUTH AFRICA FALLOUT

SAP also said on Thursday the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had opened a new investigation of the company under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) related to South Africa.

The probe began after Baker McKenzie contacted U.S. authorities in July, SAP said, adding it was cooperating with the U.S. investigation.

Fox-Martin said a separate internal probe by the company had found loopholes in its compliance and due diligence controls over how it conducts sales in South Africa and other countries.

SAP operates in more than 180 countries, selling business planning software that many of the world’s top multinationals rely on. It is a big supplier of corporate compliance software designed to control sales practices, among its various products.

In response, SAP said it had stopped paying sales commissions on all public sector deals in countries such as Brazil, China, India, Italy, Mexico, Russia and South Africa.

The company said its government sales commission ban would apply to any country rated below 50 in Transparency International’s annual Corruption Perceptions Index. There were 122 countries in the activist group’s 2016 report with high-risk ratings, though SAP does not necessarily operate in all of them.

The response comes after SAP was hit last year with a $3.9 million fine by the U.S. SEC, which found it failed to maintain internal controls to prevent a bribery scheme by a former sales executive who won lucrative contracts from the Panamanian government. (reut.rs/2vcPOIp)

SAP also said on Thursday it was instituting extensive additional compliance and due diligence controls on the use of third-party sales agents and value-added resellers to win SAP software and services contracts and would conduct stepped-up audits worldwide.

“We hope that the actions we have taken and our responsiveness ... demonstrates how heartfelt this issue is for us (and) how disappointed we are that SAP has been identified with wrong-doing in this way,” Fox-Martin said.

In July, SAP put four senior South African managers on leave pending the outcome of the Baker McKenzie probe. One of those employees was found to have no involvement in the disputed government contracts and will return to work, the company said.

The influence-peddling scandal has swept up other multinational companies, including management consultant McKinsey & Co.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 16 percent to $20.04 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. The company did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT.","Twitter says it could turn first-ever profit, shares surge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results/twitter-says-it-could-turn-first-ever-profit-shares-surge-idUKKBN1CV1JP?il=0

Nas últimas semanas, o setor tem tido intensa movimentação, com as fintechs mais estabelecidas procurando se firmar, acertando aportes mais robustos de investidores ou fazendo parcerias com bancos e varejistas para ganhar escala e visilibidade, como forma se destacar num mercado que já conta mais de 300 dessas startups.

O Nubank, que se notabilizou por meio da plataforma digital de cartões de crédito sem anuidade, anunciou na véspera que passará a operar contas de pagamentos. Na semana passada, o aplicativo de finanças GuiaBolso captou 125 milhões de reais em rodada liderada pelo sueco Vostok, a maior de um fundo de capital de risco para América Latina neste ano. Dias antes, o marketplace Bom Pra Crédito fechou parceria com a CBSS, banco dos sócios Bradesco e Banco do Brasil.

Fontes do setor ouvidas pela Reuters citam pelo menos mais dois acordos de cifras similares aos do GuiaBolso que devem ser anunciados nas próximas semanas.

Segundo o chefe no Brasil da área de inovação da Accenture, Guilherme Horn, grandes investidores globais até agora vinham fazendo aportes mais pontuais em fintechs, enquanto aguardavam sinais do BC, fase vencida quando a autoridade monetária pôs a regulação em audiência pública no fim de agosto. A previsão é que as novas normas, em que o BC criará parâmetros mínimos operacionais, sejam editadas até o final do ano.

“Regulamentações costumam dar uma peneirada no mercado”, disse Horn. “Agora, quem ficar abaixo do padrão do BC vai ter que dar um jeito, ou se adapta ou é vendido. Quem está dentro vai crescer, porque vai atrair mais investidores e parceiros.”

O movimento sublinha o encurtamento dos ciclos de negócios no setor alta tecnologia em relação a setores mais tradicionais da economia, nos quais os processos de expansão e consolidação podem levar décadas.

Com um modelo de negócios relativamente barato - várias dessas startups foram criadas com um investimento inicial de poucas dezenas de milhares de reais -, usando modelos matemáticos para medir o risco de clientes potenciais e oferecer crédito e produtos financeiros. O apelo da agilidade e de juros e tarifas menores ou inexistentes rapidamente caiu nas graças do público.

O movimento também prosperou diante de uma postura mais amigável do BC, que preferiu monitorar a atividade do setor, em vez de proibir a operação de empresas não reguladas para oferecer serviços financeiros. Por fim, o modelo de parceria, na maior parte das vezes com bancos médios ou com cooperativas, exime essas startups de regras mais rígidas.

Como resultado, num espaço de três anos, o número de fintechs no Brasil foi multiplicado por seis.

MAIS CARO

Mas, de certa forma, sinais de que o mercado não conseguiria comportar tantas fintechs existem há algum tempo. Em parte porque conseguir se diferenciar num mercado que se multiplica tão rápido ficou mais desafiador, isto é, mais caro.

Como o marketing é quase todo feito pela Internet, o preço para aparecer em primeiro em páginas de busca como o Google tem subido sem parar.

Rodrigo Ubaldo, sócio-fundador da Allgoo, especializada em digitalizar instituições financeiras, calcula que o custo unitário de aquisição de clientes na Internet chega a 700 reais.

“Embora ainda seja menor do que o custo por cliente nos canais físicos, é um preço que está ficando alto demais”, disse Ubaldo.

No que parece ser um paradoxo, algumas dessas fintechs estão procurando fazer divulgação usando canais físicos, seja abordando pessoas diretamente nas ruas ou comprando espaço na mídia tradicional.

“O canal de divulgação exclusivo pela Internet está se exaurindo”, disse Rogério Cardozo, diretor executivo da Enova, dona da plataforma online de crédito Simplic. “Estamos pensando em ter stands em lugares públicos”, disse Marcelo Ciampolini, presidente-executivo da Lendico.

Outro fator que concorre para filtrar as fintechs sobreviventes é o fôlego financeiro. Em outras palavras, por quanto tempo a empresa pode operar no vermelho, investindo só no crescimento da base.

“Poderíamos atingir o break even (lucro) em dois meses se quiséssemos; era só desacelerar”, disse Cristina Junqueira, cofundadora e vice-presidente de desenvolvimento de negócios da Nubank, em agosto à Reuters. “Mas isso não faz sentido hoje.” O Nubank tem um público estimado em 2,5 milhões de portadores de cartões.

Em outra frente, a capacidade de funding da instituição financeira sócia também pode limitar a capacidade de expansão. Só em crédito esse mercado já movimenta mais de 1 bilhão de reais por ano. E é isso que tem incentivado uma aproximação entre fintechs e aqueles antes vistos como rivais, os grandes bancos.

O CBSS, de Bradesco e BB, apostou nisso quando anunciou parceria com o Bom pra Crédito, semanas atrás. “Prevemos em 2018 ter 30 por cento do crédito digital”, disse à Reuters Carlos Giovanne, presidente do CBSS, no início do mês. Em outra frente, o Bradesco até o fim do ano deve deslanchar seu banco eletrônico, o Next.",Regulação do BC deve precipitar consolidação de fintechs no Brasil,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CV2J7-OBRBS

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

The track, played during the National Party’s successful 2014 election campaign and titled “Eminem Esque”, was found by a New Zealand court to have “substantially copied” Lose Yourself.

The National Party used the song 186 times during the campaign before taking the ad off the air, the court said.

“This decision is a warning to sound-alike music producers and their clients everywhere,” Adam Simpson, director of Simpsons Solicitors, who acted for Eminem’s music company, Eight Mile Style, said in a statement.

“Being licensed and available for purchase, and having taken advice from our suppliers, the party believed the purchase was legal,” National Party President Peter Goodfellow said in a statement.

“The party is now considering the implications of the judgment and the next steps. We already have a claim against the suppliers and licensors of the track.”

The court found Eight Mile Style was entitled to damages of NZ$600,000 ($413,000) with interest from June 28, 2014.

“We anticipate that all the defendants will meet to discuss the implications of the decision in the very near future,” copyright body AMCOS said in an email, hailing the decision as an important first step towards resolution of the matter.

The publisher had exclusive control over the song, and rarely gave permission for its use in advertising, the court said.

Both players knew a win would secure a passage to the semi-finals as they held identical 1-1 records in White Group play at the season-ending event but the 37-year-old was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court to progress.

Muguruza had brushed aside Williams to claim her second grand slam title in July but any hopes she had of repeating the feat were snuffed out by a resolute opponent, who simply refused to buckle in the tense Singapore Indoor Stadium encounter.

“I played an amazing opponent who has had an amazing year so I was so happy to win the last point,” Williams said in a courtside interview.

The victory enabled Williams, who won this event in 2008, to advance along with pool winner Karolina Pliskova, who won her first two matches but ended round-robin play with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko earlier on Thursday.

The winner-takes-all showdown started with Williams looking to dictate terms, pushing Muguruza around the court and attacking her second serve as the Spaniard countered by pushing the American back with her deep groundstrokes.

The 37-year-old continued to pick away at the Muguruza serve but an ace and a string of big forehand winners helped stave off the early threat as both combatants took the fight to each other in a high-class encounter.

The pair traded service breaks before Muguruza failed to hold on and send the opener into a tiebreak when Williams converted her third set point after the back-peddling Spaniard dumped a forehand into the net.

OSTAPENKO VICTORIOUS

Muguruza’s repeated attempts to pull clear in the second were denied by Williams on every occasion with the American twice battling back from behind to edge 5-4 ahead with her strongest service game of the set.

The American made a concerted push for victory in the 10th game and sealed a memorable victory after an hour and 41 minutes when Muguruza sent another feeble forehand into the net.

“It’s not easy out here, you have to play every point well or you end up losing the game. I had some great coaching going into my match and I hope I can win some more,” Williams added.

Earlier, Ostapenko ended her maiden WTA Finals campaign on a winning note with a surprisingly easy victory over a subdued Pliskova, the Latvian saving her best until last after she was eliminated earlier in the week.

World number three Pliskova won her opening two matches against Williams and Muguruza to book a semi-final berth but the Czech was out-gunned by an inspired French Open champion in 66 minutes.

Ostapenko had battled hard in her opening matches to no avail, especially in a grueling three-set loss to Williams, but she served brilliantly against Pliskova and found the corners with her booming forehand to end her season with a win.

“Yes, I lost my earlier two matches but it’s my first time here and I am just happy to finish my season here, in the top eight, especially with a win at the end,” Ostapenko said.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under fire in recent days over conflict-of-interest allegations, pointed to stronger-than-expected economic growth as proof the Liberal strategy of deficit spending had paid dividends in the two years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a surprise majority.

“So now, with a little more wind in our sails, we’re doubling down on a plan with proven results and reinvesting in the middle class,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.

The government has been badly shaken by charges that Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell (MSI.TO), was in a conflict of interest because he did not place his holdings in a blind trust, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The deficit was projected to shrink to C$19.9 billion this year from C$28.5 billion projected in the March budget, but the improvement included a reduction in the government’s so-called fiscal cushion to C$1.5 billion from C$3 billion in March.

The budget shortfall was forecast to shrink further, to C$18.6 billion next year and to C$12.5 billion by the end of the budget’s five-year horizon in 2022-23. Each of those years included a C$3 billion fiscal cushion, a risk adjustment that economists consider prudent.

Morneau’s update had little impact on financial markets, but the additional stimulus may give the Bank of Canada more room to continue to hike interest rates, though no move is expected at the bank’s next policy decision on Wednesday.

“You kind of have a hand off from monetary policy to the federal government by way of fiscal stimulus,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. “If you can thread the needle, then it’s a great strategy ... the challenge comes if there’s a hiccup in any link of the chain as it pertains to either monetary or fiscal policy.”

Morneau said the government would strengthen the child benefit by indexing it to inflation from next July, a pledge that will cost C$5.6 billion over five years, and increase the tax benefit for low-income workers.

He forecast GDP growth to slow to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, from 3.1 percent this year.

Together with the smaller deficits, the growth would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.5 percent this year from 31.2 in 2016-2017 and gradually to 28.5 percent by 2022-23, better than most G7 rivals.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT2WG-OCADN

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. The company did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT.","Twitter says it could turn first-ever profit, shares surge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results/twitter-says-it-could-turn-first-ever-profit-shares-surge-idUSKBN1CV1JP

Teck, the world’s second-biggest exporter of steelmaking coal, said it expects a larger proportion of its coal sales in the fourth quarter to be non-premium coal, reducing its average realized price to about 85 percent of benchmark prices.

Teck’s realized prices are usually 90 percent to 95 percent of the benchmark, TD Securities analyst Greg Barnes said in a note to clients.

Vancouver-based Teck said it expected to return to a more traditional product mix going into 2018.

Teck’s shares were down 5.7 percent at C$27.56 on the Toronto Stock Exchange by 09:45 am.

Teck expects total coal sales, including spot sales, of 6.5 million tonnes in the fourth quarter.

The company, which also mines copper and zinc, reported third-quarter adjusted profit of C$621 million, or C$1.08 per share, below analyst forecasts for C$1.19 a share, according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Earnings, which were nearly four times higher than at the same time a year ago, were boosted by higher coal and metal prices.

Teck sold 7.54 million tonnes of steelmaking coal in the third quarter, marginally above its sales forecast for between 7.2 million and 7.5 million tonnes.

Teck’s average third-quarter realized coal price was $159 a tonne, in line with the $158 to $163 a tonne it had forecast on Sept. 6.

Both funds have a combined $10 million in assets, with a target of $100 million, Kyle Samani, Multicoin’s managing partner said in an interview with Reuters. Samani expects the firm to hit that goal in the first quarter of 2018.

The firm actively manages two funds: Diversified and Concentrated. The Diversified fund holds between 20-30 tokens at any given time, while the Concentrated Fund has six to eight digital assets.

“We look for protocols that replace middlemen with network participants,” Samani said. “We’ve spent a lot of time looking at the market opportunities and at which protocols are best suited to take advantage of those opportunities.”

Samani and Jain came out of the NYU Stern School of Business and both have tech entrepreneur backgrounds.

Crypto-currency funds have mushroomed in 2017 as the market capitalization of digital tokens exploded to roughly $170 billion. The price of bitcoin alone topped nearly $6,000 eight years after it burst into the scene.

Out of bitcoin came blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions that has underpinned its technology.

There are more than 100 crypto-hedge funds that manage between $2-$3 billion, according to data Autonomous NEXT, which tracks future technology in the financial services industry. The research firm said 75 percent of the crypto funds were launched this year.

Multicoin’s Jain also pointed out that one big difference between his firm and other funds is that the company has developed new tools and security measures to invest responsibly in the token ecosystem.

The company has built proprietary technology to solve the unique challenges of token investing at venture scale, Jain said.

Multicoin also announced that David Johnston is joining its advisory board. Johnston founded the first ever crypto fund, the Dapps fund, in 2014.

GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018.

Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the “Maserati benefit” of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives.

Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company’s third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,

GE’s digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages.

But Predix’s limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT.

Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August.

In other markets, “We’re going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners,” Flannery said at GE’s annual Minds + Machines conference.

Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE’s strategy of using partners reflects the company’s realization that “they can’t build their own ecosystem.”

GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016.

GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said.

GE Digital’s chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N). GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads.

Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability.

“We are paying careful attention to quality,” he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure.

GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year.

GE said orders for Predix were rising sharply. Some customers at the event echoed that view. U.S. utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N), for instance, said it is rolling out Predix to its nuclear, gas, wind and other power plants after a two-year pilot of the system showed it worked as advertised, said Brian Hoff, director of corporate strategy and innovation at Exelon.

Visco, whose mandate expires at the end of this month, is a board member of the European Central Bank and is considered a close ally of ECB President Mario Draghi, who was his predecessor at the Bank of Italy.

He has been attacked by parties of all political stripes following the collapse of 10 Italian banks over the past two years, with the most recent broadsides coming from Gentiloni’s main backer, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (PD).

However, Visco, who has blamed a prolonged economic turndown for the banking crisis, maintained the crucial backing of Gentiloni and President Sergio Mattarella, political sources told Reuters.

Renzi said earlier on Thursday that the Bank of Italy had done a poor job of banking oversight under Visco and he would prefer to see him replaced, flanking the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which has campaigned actively for Visco to go.

“The Bank of Italy has been a weak point in the system,” Renzi said in a radio interview. “If they consider it is worth the effort to reconfirm Ignazio Visco, I hope the next six years will be better. I can’t see how they could be worse.”

Gentiloni made his recommendation in a letter sent to the Bank of Italy’s ruling body, its Superior Council, three political sources told Reuters.

The proposal must now be approved by the council, which will meet on Friday, and then signed off on by Mattarella. Both are expected to give their green light.

With a national election due by May next year, the problems at Italian banks have become a focal point of the political battle.

In a surprise move that sparked an institutional tug of war with Mattarella, Renzi’s PD tabled a motion in parliament this month criticizing Visco, whose re-appointment had previously been considered almost a formality.

Renzi has since continued to criticize Visco, saying the party did not support him, while adding that Gentiloni was free to propose whom he wanted for the job.

The PD, as the ruling party, had itself been targeted by the opposition after the bank collapses wiped out the savings of thousands of people who held shares and bonds in the lenders.

Because of fear, greed and other emotions, most people are terrible at managing their own money. So fund managers are trying to figure out how they can use behavioral finance - proven insights about people’s foolishness with finances - to select a basket of investments they can offer as a low-fee exchange-traded fund.

“A lot of investment nerds have thought this has been a long time coming,” said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of popular informational resource ETF.com. “And I think there will be more of these products going forward. But taking the insight that people make non-rational decisions and applying that to the markets is really tough.”

If anyone can figure it out, it is probably economics Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler, the reigning king of behavioral finance. Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, run by a team that includes Thaler and firm President Russell Fuller, does not offer a behavioral ETF, but it does offer the actively managed Behavioral Small-Cap Equity fund, which has reliably ranked in the top 2 or 3 percent of all small-cap funds.

A classic pick: Domino’s Pizza, which many investors avoided because of bad college memories of subpar slices. But when the chain started churning out positive earnings surprises, Fuller & Thaler started ordering shares. They bought at $27 and got out at $112.

“We’re all human, we’re all imperfect, and we all have emotions,” said Ed Stubbins, a partner at Fuller & Thaler. “Investors underreact and they overreact - and that’s where we come in.”

A BASKET OF BEHAVIORS

One of the foremost behavioral ETFs so far is Aptus Behavioral Momentum, which launched in June 2016. It has healthy year-to-date returns of 11.33 percent, although that lags the S&P 500’s 14 percent gain. The ETF has drawn $40 million in investor assets so far - decent for a new product but still only a drop in the bucket of the $4 trillion in ETFs globally.

BEMO focuses on one particular behavioral hiccup: When a stock is on a tear and at a 52-week high, many investors tend to get nervous and sell. BEMO prefers to let its winners ride.

“We think there is a lot of irrationality around that price point,” said John Goldsberry, managing director at Aptus Capital Advisors, who identifies Alpha Architect and Cambria Funds as competitors in this relatively new ETF arena.

So how exactly does Aptus pounce on these investor fears? It sifts through the S&P 500 for stocks with plenty of price momentum that are at or close to their 52-week highs. The top 25 go into its portfolio.

Think of this strategy as the flip side of classic value investing. A deep-value investor might pick through the bargain bin for stocks that are being beaten up; BEMO hunts for a white-hot winner in order to keep riding that wave as investors pile in.

Behavioral ETFs are still limited to a handful of products - which often do not even have “behavior” in the fund title - including Alpha Architect’s suite of five ETFs like ValueShares US Quantitative Value and MomentumShares US Quantitative Momentum.

Here is another option for investors: Take a step back with a so-called separately-managed account (SMA) with a behavioral focus. SMAs are not ETFs themselves, but invest in ETFs based on their own data-crunching and behavioral judgments.

That is what money manager AthenaInvest does, with impressive results. Its particular strategy is to examine what fund managers are thinking, organize them into “clusters,” and then place bets based on where the market is likely heading - taking advantage of the herd mentality, so to speak.

So when virtually all fund managers were making positive noises about the market earlier this year, AthenaInvest’s Global Tactical fund bet big on a leveraged S&P 500 ETF. That was very good news for its investors, who reaped twice the rewards of most market bulls. The $150 million fund boasts returns of 20 percent year-to-date, and roughly 20 percent annually since inception in 2010.

“We don’t use modern portfolio theory at all - we’re all behavioral,” said Tom Howard, AthenaInvest’s CEO and chief investment officer. “And we were thrilled to see Dick Thaler win the Nobel Prize. It makes us all more legitimate.”","Oh, behave: How to make sense of behavioral ETFs",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-investing-behavioraletf/oh-behave-how-to-make-sense-of-behavioral-etfs-idUSKBN1CV1TL

“We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the Constitution,” Haider al-Abadi said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) proposed on Wednesday an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi Constitution”.

The Kurds have been swiftly making concessions to Baghdad since last week, when Abadi sent his forces to seize all Kurdish-held territory outside of three autonomous provinces.

A startlingly rapid advance by government troops transformed the balance of power in northern Iraq within a matter of days and has wrecked decades-old dreams of Kurdish independence that had come to a head last month with a referendum on secession.

Baghdad has always considered the Kurdish secession referendum illegal. Abadi’s visit to Iran on Thursday follows a trip to Turkey on Wednesday, a diplomatic offensive that has shored up support from Iraq’s neighbors for his hard line.

Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday the Kurdish offer to suspend the push for independence was a step in the right direction but did not go far enough.

Abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of Iraq’s border crossings with Turkey, including the oil export pipeline hub at Fish-Khabur, located just inside the Kurdish autonomous region.

A media assistant to Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, had repelled three attacks by Iraqi forces, two in the direction of Fish-Khabur, and one in Perde, on the road linking Kirkuk to the KRG capital Erbil, destroying several tanks and armored vehicles.

Iraqi authorities did not confirm this account of fighting. Both contested areas have important oil assets.

IRAN SEEKS TO DRIVE WEDGE

The fighting between the central government and the Kurds is particularly tricky for the United States which is a close ally of both sides, arming and training both the Kurds and the central government’s army to fight Islamic State.

Iraq is one of the only countries in the world that is closely allied to both the United States and Iran, and Tehran has used the Kurdish separatism bid as a way to drive a wedge between Washington and Baghdad.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Abadi in Tehran that he should not rely on the United States in the fight against Islamic State.

“Unity was the most important factor in your gains against terrorists and their supporters,” Khamenei said, according to state TV. “Don’t trust America ... It will harm you in the future.”

Last week, Abadi spurned a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to send “home” Iranian-backed paramilitary fighters. Abadi’s office called paramilitaries “patriots”.

The Kurdish crisis has broken out even as Iraq is about to finally defeat Islamic State, also known as ISIL, ISIS or Daesh, after a three-year war in which it received strong backing from a U.S.-led coalition, the Kurds and Iran.

Iraqi forces launched an offensive on Thursday to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.

“Daesh members have to choose between death and surrender,” Abadi said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al-Qaim and Rawa.

Islamic State’s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months.

The militant group still holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under its control has rapidly shrunk there too, with its de facto Syrian capital falling to a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led force last week.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away.","If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

Thailand’s benchmark 5-percent broken rice was quoted at $375-$388 a tonne, free-on-board (FOB) Bangkok, up from $375-$385 last week.

“There looks to be demand from Sri Lanka, which we’re optimistic will translate into more demand for Thai rice,” said a Bangkok-based rice trader.

The government of Sri Lanka has issued a tender to buy 200,000 tonnes of rice as recent floods in the country have destroyed crops.

In Thailand, however, heavy rain have not hurt crops and all of the rice has already been harvested. But, the rains have caused difficulties for shipments to be collected and delivered, which has had a negative impact on exports, traders said.

“Due to heavy rains, a lot of ships from abroad coming in to get rice have had to push their schedule back. From November onwards when the rains subside, exports will hopefully be more active,” said a Bangkok-based trader.

India’s 5 percent broken parboiled rice prices edged down by $2 per tonne to $402 to $405 per tonne this week.

“New season supply will be available in the next few weeks. Exports will also pick up with supply,” said B V Krishna Rao, managing director of leading exporter Pattabhi Agro Foods Pvt.

“Demand is expected to be robust from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the next few months,” he added.

Bangladesh, which has emerged as a major importer this year after floods damaged its crops, has approved the purchase of 100,000 tonnes of parboiled rice from India in a government-to-government deal at $455 a tonne, including CIF and discharge costs.

It has also approved a purchase of 150,000 tonnes of parboiled rice from Thailand at $465 a tonne.

The country’s major summer rice output in 2017 fell about 5 percent from a year earlier to 18 million tonnes, the lowest in seven years, according to a preliminary estimate of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, high prices prevailed as rice stocks were running dry, traders said. Benchmark 5-percent broken rice rates rose to $395-405 per tonne, FOB Saigon, from $390-400 last week.

“Supply is very low. We are running out of stock, so rice prices will stay high,” a trader in Ho Chi Minh City said, adding trade was dull as Vietnam’s prices are not appealing to foreign rice importers.

“I think prices will have to fall, otherwise no one would buy from us,” another trader said.

Traders said new supply would not be available until the completion of minor autumn-winter crop harvest in November.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

Lo ha annunciato la banca centrale al termine del proprio meeting di politica monetaria, che ha inoltre lasciato invariati, come previsto, i tassi di interesse.

L‘annuncio odierno significa che il controvalore del Qe lieviterà almeno di altri 270 miliardi oltre i circa 2.300 che il programma raggiungerà alla scadenza di dicembre 2017.

La decisione di “ricalibrare” il Qe, ha successivamente spiegato il presidente della banca centrale Mario Draghi nella conferenza stampa post meeting, riflette la “crescente fiducia” di una convergenza dell‘economia della zona verso il target di inflazione.

PROGRAMMA APERTO

Allo stesso tempo Francoforte ha conservato la facoltà di tornare ad incrementare il programma in caso di necessità, confermando nel complesso l‘attesa del mercato per un approccio ‘morbido’ al processo di rimozione dello stimolo monetario.

“Se l‘outlook diventerà meno favorevole, o le condizioni finanziarie diventeranno non coerenti con un ulteriore progresso verso un sostenuto aggiustamento nel percorso dell‘inflazione, il Consiglio direttivo resta pronto a incrementare il programma di acquisti in termini di importo e/o durata”, si legge nella nota della Bce.

La decisione odierna non è stata unanime, ha sottolineato Draghi, spiegando che le divergenze hanno riguardato non tanto gli importi o altri aspetti del Qe quanto la possibilità che questo avesse o meno un termine definito; un‘ampia maggioranza dei membri del board, ha aggiunto, ha comunque optato per tenerlo ‘open ended’ ovvero con la possibilità di un prolungamento.

INFLAZIONE

Lo stesso Draghi ha d‘altra parte sottolineato che un “ampio grado” di aggiustamento monetario resta necessario, a fronte di un‘inflazione che al momento deve ancora dare segnali convincenti di un trend sostenuto, anche se si prevede, che continuerà a salire gradualmente nel medio termine.

La banca centrale conferma inoltre che i proventi dei titoli in scadenza detenuti nell‘ambito del Qe continueranno a essere reinvestiti per un considerevole periodo di tempo anche dopo la fine del programma stesso, e in ogni caso finché necessario; i reinvestimenti, ha spiegato Draghi, saranno condotti con flessibilità, con la possibilità di fluttuazioni tra le diverse giurisdizioni.

Confermata anche la prosecuzione delle operazioni di rifinanziamento, sia quelle principali settimanali sia quelle trimestrali, secondo l‘attuale schema a tasso fisso e a rubinetto.

TASSI

In linea con le attese, al termine del consiglio di politica monetaria Bce, il tasso sui finanziamenti principali resta confermato a zero, così come i tassi su depositi e prestiti marginali rispettivamente a -0,4% e 0,25%.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them. Confusingly, these two publics are sometimes one.",Commentary: How hate speech can harm your brain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-speech-commentary/commentary-how-hate-speech-can-harm-your-brain-idUSKBN1CB1XD

“I’ve always been around and involved in politics and believe that we all have to participate one way or another. But no, I‘m not going to get into it,” Clooney told Reuters.

“I don’t have to answer to any one person. I don’t have to make compromises, I can point the finger at whomever I think needs to be pointed out,” he added.

In his latest film “Suburbicon,” Clooney directs a darkly humorous 1950s crime tale in which he points the finger squarely at the racial tensions in present-day America with a story about a black family moving into an affluent white suburban neighborhood as the backdrop.

“I think we should constantly be talking about whether or not building walls and scapegoating of minorities is how we want to be represented,” Clooney said.

“I think the best way to do that is to remind ourselves that this is something that we do, that we’ve been doing probably since the beginning of our country and that we have to constantly litigate it,” he added.

“Suburbicon,” out in U.S. theaters on Friday, follows Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) in the aftermath of a terrifying break-in at his suburban home, which results in the suspicious death of his wife.

As the investigation into the tragedy deepens, Gardner and his wife’s twin sister Maggie (Julianne Moore) find themselves in a situation quickly escalating beyond their control.

“This was probably the darkest role I’ve ever had a chance to play, which is very liberating,” Damon said.

Clooney said that while there are “people much better qualified to tell the story of African-Americans in mid-20th century suburbia,” he wanted to use the story of the Mayers family - based on a real black family that moved into the all-white suburb of Levittown, Pennsylvania in 1957 - to shine a light on the absurdity of racism.

In numerous scenes, the white inhabitants of the town say that while they do not want African-Americans to be oppressed, they do not want black families in their neighborhood.

“The pinnacle of white privilege is my character driving around the neighborhood on a bicycle covered in blood murdering people and nobody’s looking at him because they’re all focused on the Mayers family and blaming them for all their problems,” Damon said.",George Clooney rebukes racism in backdrop of thriller 'Suburbicon',https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CU39A-OCAEN

Wall Street has often overlooked the company’s relatively small profits as Chief Executive Jeff Bezos chases growth.

Bezos has looked to cement the company’s position as a leader in cloud services, become a formidable foe of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and disrupt the retail industry with its recent purchase of premium grocer Whole Foods.

This quarter, however, investors will want to see if Amazon’s operating income is being pressured as it cuts prices to fight competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which is investing heavily in its own online business.

“The open question for the fourth quarter is whether they will have to compete on price because Wal-Mart is making such a push into online,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a preview note.

“If their guidance for operating profit is substantially below a year ago, then that’s a signal that they intend to compete on price.”

Amazon closed its $13.7 billion Whole Foods buy on Aug. 28 and immediately slashed prices of some products at the grocer.

Analysts say the price cuts and investments in other sectors, from cloud computing to video, are likely to raise the company’s costs and reduce third-quarter operating income.

Amazon has given a wide forecast range - between operating income of $300 million and an operating loss of $400 million.

Analysts on average are expecting $144.6 million, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.

The company said in July it expected third-quarter revenue of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion. Analysts expect revenue to rise 29 percent $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Amazon’s shares were up 0.6 percent in early trading on Thursday. They have dropped 7 percent since the company reported second-quarter results on July 27.

Investors acknowledge that Amazon’s ambitions to disrupt multiple industries requires constant spending, and lower margins may not be a big concern, Barclays analysts said in their preview note.

The company’s operating costs jumped 29 percent to $32.14 billion in the third quarter of 2016.

Shareholders will also be closely watching Amazon’s holiday-quarter forecast, he said, adding that the company might forecast disappointing fourth-quarter operating income.

Amazon reported operating income of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The high level of spending is not going to slow this year either, analysts said.

Video will remain an area where Amazon spends heavily as original shows help it gain and retain subscribers. Rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) commands the online-streaming market by spending billions on original shows.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

“Looking back now, it’s hard to believe that almost exactly 23 years ago I made my professional debut,” Hingis said on Facebook on Thursday.

“The years that followed have been some of the most rewarding years of my life, both personally and professionally, but I believe the time has come for me to retire, which I will be doing after my last match here in Singapore.”

The retirement will be Hingis’s third in a long and illustrious career during which she claimed 25 grand slam titles since her WTA Tour debut in 1994, five in singles, seven in mixed doubles and 13 in women’s doubles.

Hingis first decided to end her career as a 22-year-old in 2003 due to persistent injuries after picking up all five of her singles crowns as a teenager, comprising three Australian Opens, as well as lone Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles from 1997-99.

The Swiss returned to the tour in 2006 and although she found more success in doubles than singles, she retired for a second time a year later after being handed a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine.

The right-hander returned to the sport for a third time in 2013 and has enjoyed another successful spell of doubles tennis in the latest comeback, winning four women’s and six mixed grand slam titles from 2015-17.

ALWAYS CONNECTED

Hingis and Chan opened their WTA Finals campaign with a 6-3 6-2 quarter-final victory over German-Czech duo Anna-Lena Gronefeld and Kveta Peschke, following which the Swiss elaborated on the decision to end her playing career.

“I’ll be always part of the game of tennis. Somehow we will be connected. I will definitely take some time out. I have done coaching before. I can help my mom, her tennis school. I will be connected,” she said.

”I am really looking forward to the things and challenges which will be ahead of me, but I think I also deserve some time away from the game, although I‘m not going to walk away. I will be always part and this will always be part of my life.

“I‘m definitely not going to miss that day-in, day-out grind, practicing, waking up. Maybe I will miss it after a while but in a different way. And the traveling, it’s also one thing at the start I definitely won’t miss anymore.”

The Swiss also spent 209 weeks as world number one and has won the season-ending WTA Finals twice in singles, three times in doubles and claimed a 2016 Olympic silver medal in women’s doubles with compatriot Timea Bacsinszky.

”Well, I think now it’s definite,“ she added. ”So it’s different, because before I was, like, okay, I walked away, thinking I might come back, and if I didn‘t, so that was it.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”. Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Wall Street has often overlooked the company’s relatively small profits as Chief Executive Jeff Bezos chases growth.

Bezos has looked to cement the company’s position as a leader in cloud services, become a formidable foe of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and disrupt the retail industry with its recent purchase of premium grocer Whole Foods.

This quarter, however, investors will want to see if Amazon’s operating income is being pressured as it cuts prices to fight competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which is investing heavily in its own online business.

“The open question for the fourth quarter is whether they will have to compete on price because Wal-Mart is making such a push into online,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a preview note.

“If their guidance for operating profit is substantially below a year ago, then that’s a signal that they intend to compete on price.”

Amazon closed its $13.7 billion Whole Foods buy on Aug. 28 and immediately slashed prices of some products at the grocer.

Analysts say the price cuts and investments in other sectors, from cloud computing to video, are likely to raise the company’s costs and reduce third-quarter operating income.

Amazon has given a wide forecast range - between operating income of $300 million and an operating loss of $400 million.

Analysts on average are expecting $144.6 million, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.

The company said in July it expected third-quarter revenue of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion. Analysts expect revenue to rise 29 percent $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Amazon’s shares were up 0.6 percent in early trading on Thursday. They have dropped 7 percent since the company reported second-quarter results on July 27.

Investors acknowledge that Amazon’s ambitions to disrupt multiple industries requires constant spending, and lower margins may not be a big concern, Barclays analysts said in their preview note.

The company’s operating costs jumped 29 percent to $32.14 billion in the third quarter of 2016.

Shareholders will also be closely watching Amazon’s holiday-quarter forecast, he said, adding that the company might forecast disappointing fourth-quarter operating income.

Amazon reported operating income of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The high level of spending is not going to slow this year either, analysts said.

Video will remain an area where Amazon spends heavily as original shows help it gain and retain subscribers. Rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) commands the online-streaming market by spending billions on original shows.

FILE PHOTO: Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey takes part in a panel discussion on Sharia law at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

Dopo le cinque fiducie votate ieri da Palazzo Madama per accelerare i tempi ed evitare voti segreti, oggi il cosiddetto Rosatellum Bis è passato con 214 voti a favore e 61 contrari.

Cinque senatori del Pd non hanno partecipato al voto in dissenso sulla legge.

Hanno votato contro il M5s, Fratelli d‘Italia, Sinistra Italiana e il Mdp, che ha rotto definitivamente i ponti con la maggioranza. Mentre Denis Verdini, ex coordinatore di Forza Italia e oggi alla guida del gruppo Ala, ha rivendicato il proprio sostegno al governo, e anche la disponibilità a votare lo ius soli. Favorevole anche il gruppo di centrodestra Gal.

La nuova legge elettorale prevede l‘elezione di circa un terzo dei parlamentari (36%) in collegi uninominali, il resto in collegi plurinominali con liste brevi di candidati, senza preferenze.

Il Rosatellum dispone soglie di sbarramento del 3% per le liste, e del 10% per le coalizioni. Alla Camera la ripartizione dei seggi sarà su base nazionale, al Senato su base regionale.

Secondo gli stessi proponenti, questo sistema misto non garantirà per certo la governabilità, in uno scenario politico basato su tre poli (centrosinistra, centrodestra e M5s). Ma, incentivando la formazione delle coalizioni, favorirà di più la stabilità rispetto al proporzionale.

Per gli oppositori, il risultato della legge sarà quello di consentire ai leader di partiti di scegliersi direttamente parlamentari fedeli e di portare a una “grande coalizione” tra Forza Italia e Pd.

Il governo ora si prepara ad affrontare il passaggio della legge di bilancio. Ieri le fiducie sono passate con circa 150 voti ognuna. Anche aggiungendo la pattuglia di senatori Pd che non ha votato la fiducia per protesta, l‘esecutivo non ha la maggioranza assoluta, quindi dovrà recuperare voti in aula. Secondo fonti governative, la modifica di alcuni punti della legge di bilancio (per esempio sul superticket) potrebbe ammorbidire la posizione di Mdp.

Per il Pd invece resta il problema delle alleanze, dopo la rottura sulla legge elettorale. In questo senso, partito e Palazzo Chigi sono al lavoro per portare in aula al Senato lo ius soli con il voto di fiducia, nonostante l‘opposizione di Ap, ma col sostegno anche di Mdp e Si. Si tratterebbe dell‘ultimo atto di governo.

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government’s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law.

But it has faced widespread criticism from lawmakers of all parties - including May’s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit.

As a result, the bill’s passage through parliament will depend on May’s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel lawmakers who said they were “deadly serious” about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit.

The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.

The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some lawmakers, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.

“Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,” a Brexit department spokeswoman said.

“We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.”

Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for “Brexit day” on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country’s laws.

He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle.

May’s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required.

DEADLY SERIOUS

Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative lawmakers to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.

One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill. “We are deadly serious,” Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.

Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer lawmakers a vote on the final exit package.

The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow lawmakers to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal.

Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification.

Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU’s preferred negotiating timetable.

Despite his clarification, lawmakers signaled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives lawmakers a greater say.

“Looking back now, it’s hard to believe that almost exactly 23 years ago I made my professional debut,” Hingis said on Facebook on Thursday.

“The years that followed have been some of the most rewarding years of my life, both personally and professionally, but I believe the time has come for me to retire, which I will be doing after my last match here in Singapore.”

The retirement will be Hingis’s third in a long and illustrious career during which she claimed 25 grand slam titles since her WTA Tour debut in 1994, five in singles, seven in mixed doubles and 13 in women’s doubles.

Hingis first decided to end her career as a 22-year-old in 2003 due to persistent injuries after picking up all five of her singles crowns as a teenager, comprising three Australian Opens, as well as lone Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles from 1997-99.

The Swiss returned to the tour in 2006 and although she found more success in doubles than singles, she retired for a second time a year later after being handed a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine.

The right-hander returned to the sport for a third time in 2013 and has enjoyed another successful spell of doubles tennis in the latest comeback, winning four women’s and six mixed grand slam titles from 2015-17.

ALWAYS CONNECTED

Hingis and Chan opened their WTA Finals campaign with a 6-3 6-2 quarter-final victory over German-Czech duo Anna-Lena Gronefeld and Kveta Peschke, following which the Swiss elaborated on the decision to end her playing career.

“I’ll be always part of the game of tennis. Somehow we will be connected. I will definitely take some time out. I have done coaching before. I can help my mom, her tennis school. I will be connected,” she said.

”I am really looking forward to the things and challenges which will be ahead of me, but I think I also deserve some time away from the game, although I‘m not going to walk away. I will be always part and this will always be part of my life.

“I‘m definitely not going to miss that day-in, day-out grind, practicing, waking up. Maybe I will miss it after a while but in a different way. And the traveling, it’s also one thing at the start I definitely won’t miss anymore.”

The Swiss also spent 209 weeks as world number one and has won the season-ending WTA Finals twice in singles, three times in doubles and claimed a 2016 Olympic silver medal in women’s doubles with compatriot Timea Bacsinszky.

”Well, I think now it’s definite,“ she added. ”So it’s different, because before I was, like, okay, I walked away, thinking I might come back, and if I didn‘t, so that was it.

Alon Arvatz, IntSights' co-founder and chief product officer, poses for a picture during the Reuters Cyber Summit in Tel Aviv, Israel October 24, 2017. Picture taken October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Amir Cohen

A study by Israeli threat intelligence software firm IntSights shows a 30-fold increase in dark web activity using smartphone-based messaging apps over the past year.

Several hundred thousand users are estimated to be trading stolen credit cards, account credentials, malware, drugs or to share hacking tricks over the dark web, a portion of the internet that lies beyond the reach of search engines and where user activity is largely anonymous and untraceable.

Recruitment invitations into these underground markets have spiked upward over mainstream mobile messaging apps such as Facebook’s (FB.O) WhatsApp, Telegram and Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) Skype, IntSight said.

But it is Discord, a lesser-known, two-year-old messaging app popular with video gamers, that is becoming the “go-to app” for mobile dark web discussions, where thousands of links into criminal forums were tallied up by IntSights, it said.

“Cyber crime is a commodity today: Anyone can do it,” said Alon Arvatz, IntSights’ co-founder and chief product officer, said during an interview at the Reuters Cyber Summit in Tel Aviv this week.

A spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Discord said the company had not seen the report but would consider responding once it had. WhatsApp was not immediately available to comment, while a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment. Telegram founder Pavel Durov did not respond to a request for comment.

“Today’s black market is accessible more than ever, with the tap of a finger over a portable pocket-held device,” the study said. “This could prove to cause a proliferation of low-level cybercrime, that is conducted by less qualified perpetrators”.

Traditional dark web markets required would-be users to know which sites to visit and how, using a special browser, all of which required no small amount of technical sophistication.

IntSights said hackers are turning to smaller, closed networks on social media and mobile messaging apps instead of traditionally open, moderated dark web forums because such groups can be easily set up, shut down and relocated via apps.

MESSAGING UNDERGROUND

IntSights identified 9,046 dark web invite links sent via Discord by criminal groups run from Brazil and one in Turkey.

That represents 8.7 times more cyber crime discussion links than found on Telegram, which is popular among Russians, Uzbeks, Brazilians and Iranians. Discord was 20 times more popular than WhatsApp, used by Brazilian, Indian and Nigerian criminal groups and nearly 30 times more than Skype, which is used in Brazil.

The findings are based on data scraped from thousands of black markets, document dump sites, hacker forums, chat channels, messaging apps and social media pages over the 12 months ending in July 2017. IntSights used the number of invitation links into dark web discussions as a proxy for how active criminals were across different messaging platforms.

Andrei Barysevich, a director with Recorded Future, another threat intel firm, said more and more of the biggest dark web forums have been taken offline this year, either by police or for as yet unknown reasons, in often murky circumstances.

A coordinated international police campaign in July led to the shutdown of AlphaBay and Hansa Market, two of the three top criminal marketplaces on the dark web. (reut.rs/2leaNuu) Several Russian dark markets and cybercurrency exchanges also have disappeared this year, Barysevich said. Two more markets appeared to have been shuttered earlier this month, he added.

“It seems that law enforcement has been working very hard,” he said in a phone interview.

However, he cautioned that while smartphone messaging apps may make it easier for criminals to make initial contact, researching what to buy, cloaking one’s identity and transacting business remains largely dependent on computer-based tools.

Barysevich said the use of messaging apps is likely to be a form of back-up communications in case a particular market is shut down. “It is crucial for vendor and buyer to be online all the time,” he said of how mobile apps makes such contact easier.",Criminals try message apps to evade dark web crackdown: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-summit-apps-messaging/criminals-try-message-apps-to-evade-dark-web-crackdown-report-idUSKBN1CU2SS

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said the federal government did not have to make the payments while litigation over the subsidies unfolds.

Chhabria, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appeared to be a close call, “it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.”

The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama’s signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.

Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly opposed Trump in court this year over immigration, the environment and healthcare.

After Trump’s decision to end the insurance subsidies, 18 states and the District of Columbia asked for an immediate order halting Trump’s move while the case is being litigated. They argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates.

In his ruling, Chhabria said the kind of emergency order requested by the states was not necessary.

“The truth is that most state regulators have devised responses that give millions of lower-income people better health coverage options than they would otherwise have had,” Chhabria said.

“This is true in almost all the states joining this lawsuit,” the judge added.

U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said the subsidy payments usurped Congress’ spending power and that the department was pleased with Chhabria’s ruling.

BIPARTISAN PROPOSAL

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the lawsuit, said in a statement that Trump’s decision undermined payments that keep healthcare affordable.

“Without an emergency order halting the Trump action, swift action in this litigation becomes even more compelling,” he said.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said the ruling “only makes it more critical” that the Senate pass a bipartisan agreement she co-authored, which would authorize the subsidies.

Earlier on Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the proposal would cut the U.S. deficit by $3.8 billion over the next decade.

The subsidies were amounting to nearly $600 million a month. They were due to cost $7 billion this year and were estimated to grow to $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts.

With the beginning of enrollment for 2018 insurance policies on Obamacare exchanges set for Nov. 1, Chhabria suggested that the states focus on communicating the message that they have devised a response to the subsidy cuts that prevents harm to a large number of people.

“If the states are so concerned that people will be scared away from the exchanges by the thought of higher premiums, perhaps they should stop yelling about higher premiums,” Chhabria wrote.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

Trump has said he was considering both Powell and Taylor, but that he also liked current Fed Chair Janet Yellen very much. Politico cited an unnamed source who talks regularly to Trump as saying the only finalists were Powell and Taylor.

Another unnamed senior source that Politico described as very close to the process said it was not safe to assume Trump will nominate Powell or Taylor for the top spot at the central bank, saying he “changes his mind about it every day.”

A White House official told Reuters: “No final decision has been made.”

Trump has been considering a short list for the post that also includes his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn, who is helping to lead White House efforts to push a big tax cut package through Congress. Warsh’s chances at the job have also appeared to fade, according to media reports, and Politico reported that its source who talks regularly to Trump said Warsh was out of the running.

As recently as Wednesday, Trump had indicated Yellen was still on the list he was considering, although he suggested he was interested in making his own mark on the Fed.

“I liked her a lot,” Trump said of a recent meeting he held with Yellen. “I mean, it’s somebody that I am thinking about,” he told Fox News Channel.

In a separate interview with Fox Business Network which aired earlier this week, Trump said he would consider either Powell or Taylor for the top Fed post and the other for another top job at the central bank.

Yellen, who was nominated by former Democratic President Barack Obama, has chaired the Fed since early 2014. Her term expires in February.

Whoever Trump selects would need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Republican president is looking to announce a Fed chair nominee before leaving on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3 to give his choice time to go through the confirmation process.","Fed chair choice down to Powell, Taylor, one source tells Politico",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/fed-chair-choice-down-to-powell-taylor-one-source-tells-politico-idUSKBN1CV1WQ

In Pakistan, “bailable arrest warrants” often act as a warning to deter absences from court, but a judge can later issue non-bailable warrants that are more serious and could see Sharif arrested when he returns to Pakistan.

Sharif missed the hearing as he is undertaking a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, Dawn and other English-language newspapers reported. Sharif had spent previous weeks tending to his wife in London, where she is receiving cancer treatment.

Sharif faces three separate corruption charges from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-corruption body which has its own courts. Sharif’s two sons and his daughter Maryam, who is viewed as Sharif’s heir-apparent, are also facing NAB trials.

Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.

The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable. The army denies playing a role.

“We are going through a time in Pakistan where speaking up against injustice is called contempt of court and speaking up for the nation is called treason, but I still believe that we will be victorious,” Maryam said outside the court, according to Dawn newspaper.

Sharif had a representative in court.

Sharif’s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy flats in London.

Both funds have a combined $10 million in assets, with a target of $100 million, Kyle Samani, Multicoin’s managing partner said in an interview with Reuters. Samani expects the firm to hit that goal in the first quarter of 2018.

Multicoin has an long-term investment view, typically three to four years, said managing partner Tushar Jain. That’s far longer than the typical horizon of digital currency funds of just a few months.

“We’ll adjust the percentage of the portfolio during that time. We only invest in assets that will hold for that time frame,” Jain added.

The firm actively manages two funds: Diversified and Concentrated. The Diversified fund holds between 20-30 tokens at any given time, while the Concentrated Fund has six to eight digital assets.

“We look for protocols that replace middlemen with network participants,” Samani said. “We’ve spent a lot of time looking at the market opportunities and at which protocols are best suited to take advantage of those opportunities.”

Samani and Jain came out of the NYU Stern School of Business and both have tech entrepreneur backgrounds.

Crypto-currency funds have mushroomed in 2017 as the market capitalization of digital tokens exploded to roughly $170 billion. The price of bitcoin alone topped nearly $6,000 eight years after it burst into the scene.

Out of bitcoin came blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions that has underpinned its technology.

There are more than 100 crypto-hedge funds that manage between $2-$3 billion, according to data Autonomous NEXT, which tracks future technology in the financial services industry. The research firm said 75 percent of the crypto funds were launched this year.

Multicoin’s Jain also pointed out that one big difference between his firm and other funds is that the company has developed new tools and security measures to invest responsibly in the token ecosystem.

The company has built proprietary technology to solve the unique challenges of token investing at venture scale, Jain said.

Multicoin also announced that David Johnston is joining its advisory board. Johnston founded the first ever crypto fund, the Dapps fund, in 2014.

Thursday’s comments add to the mystery about Aramco’s listing venues as global exchanges compete to win part of the flotation as it will bring a major boost to trading volumes.

Saudi Aramco’s chief executive said this week that domestic and international exchanges such as New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been examined for a partial listing.

The $100 billion IPO is aimed at helping raise the kingdom’s profile in the eyes of overseas investors, a key part of its goal to reform the economy that is reliant on oil revenues.

Asked by a reporter whether he had given up, NYSE Group President Thomas Farley replied: “No.”

Farley, who is attending an investment conference in Riyadh said the NYSE was talking to Saudi authorities about it but declined to elaborate.

Khalid al-Hussan, chief executive of the Saudi exchange, known as Tadawul, said earlier his exchange aspired to be the exclusive venue for listing the share sale and could absorb all of it.

Such a listing would dwarf anything else on the bourse.

Tadawul was working hard to convince Aramco of the merits of such a move, but the company had not yet decided, he said.

FILE PHOTO: A trader stands in front of a screen displaying stock information at the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) in Riyadh June 15, 2015. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File Photo/File Photo

“Tadawul is the main exchange in the region and as the most liquid among the largest 25 exchanges in the world and among the 10 largest emerging markets, Tadawul aspires to be the exclusive venue,” he said at an investment conference in Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia expects to value the state-owned oil producer at a minimum of $2 trillion, in what could be the world’s biggest IPO, the centerpiece of its Vision 2030 plan to diversify the economy away from oil.

But some analysts have expressed concern about the risk of the share sale swamping the local market.

Tadawul’s market capitalization of Tadawul is about $340 billion. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE, the largest company listed to date, has a market capitalization of about $78 billion.

“The exclusive listing of Aramco on the Saudi stock exchange is possible but at a speculated valuation of around $2 trillion it will be too large for Tadawul to solely handle the listing of even a 5 percent stake sale,” said Nitin Garg, senior analyst at SICO Bahrain. “The Saudi market does not have sufficient liquidity to absorb such a large initial public offering.”","NYSE not given up on Aramco IPO, as Saudi bourse eyes exclusive role",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-economy-tadawul/nyse-not-given-up-on-aramco-ipo-as-saudi-bourse-eyes-exclusive-role-idUSKBN1CV0FW

On weekend evenings, it transforms into a revved-up runway of tuned-up Japanese cars.

The unassuming rest stop is famous to car enthusiasts as a temple of the country’s motor culture, but it also illustrates a “youth” problem that auto companies such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co are scrambling to address.

The crowd last Friday - around 50 supercar fans who huddled around the back of a loading truck to get a first glimpse of the latest Lamborghini Huracan Performante delivered days before to collector Takeshi Kimura - were mainly men in their 40s and 50s.

“Today’s young people, they came of age during the recession, and some of them didn’t grow up with a family car,” said Kimura, who has earned a reputation on Japanese social media as an ambassador of car culture thanks to stunts including coasting his Ferrari F40 down ski slopes and racing his supercars around a driving school practice course.

“As a result, people hit their 20s and they’re not aware of how fun cars can be.”

On top of that, the cars whose finely-tuned growls echoed beneath the overpasses that criss-cross the Daikoku lot are mostly from the 1990s heyday of Japan’s auto industry.

Back then, Honda Motor Co, Nissan and their compatriots forged a global reputation for their stylish, fast, highly engineered cars. Drifting, the technique of sliding rear-wheel-drive cars through bends that entered popular culture through films like the Fast and the Furious franchise, was born on Japan’s winding roads.

Today, even those young Japanese who do get the car bug are unimpressed by the domestic choices on offer.

“These days automakers just aren’t making cars I’d want to drive,” said Sho Watabe, a 20-year-old student who had rocked up to Daikoku in his 1996 Mazda RX-7.

“If you look at the way cars are designed these days, they all look the same. They all lack personality ... If automakers keep making the same types of cars, young people are going to continue turning away from them.”

Japanese car makers for years have grappled with falling interest in cars among young people, which, along with a rapidly greying society, has led to a 17 percent fall in domestic vehicle sales since 2000, data from the Japan Auto Dealers Association shows.

The number of Japanese license holders aged under 30 has dropped 35 percent since 2001, according to National Police Agency data, even as the total number of license holders has increased around 9 percent during the same period.

The country’s tuning culture, once known among global car fans for its focus on squeezing as much speed as possible out of mass-market models, is also losing its pep, as complex control units and sensors make cars increasingly hard to tinker with.

To appease car enthusiasts and drum up more interest among young people, Toyota last month launched a new line of customized, sporty versions of the Prius, Yaris and other existing models in Japan under its Gazoo racing brand, which feature sports car tuning and racing trims.

Nissan is also marketing more sportier siblings of its flagship models, unveiling racing versions of its Leaf electric car and its Serena minivan at the Tokyo Motor Show this week.

“Mass market consumers want reliable, convenient cars, but we want to position Gazoo as a platform to use our ‘secret sauce’, to use our tuning capabilities to attract car fans,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters last month.

To raise brand awareness among young car fans, Toyota and a growing number of automakers and suppliers are tapping the country’s drifting culture, which has cleaned up its image after being associated for years with illegal road racing.

“We don’t participate in motor sports in a big way, so we weren’t registering with young drivers, a small but important market for us,” said Junichi Sugano, a spokesman at Toyo Tires, known domestically as a specialist in minivan tires, which was a sponsor of the first-ever FIA Intercontinental Drift Cup held earlier this month in Tokyo.

“People who attend drift events, not all of them drift, a lot of them drive minivans.”

Longer term, Toyota has also promised to expand its sports car line-up, stoking anticipation of a revival of its popular Supra model.

The U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.

Just two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.

Paul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abrahamian-northkorea-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-decision-hurts-chance-of-a-north-korea-deal-idUSKBN1CO2CY

The 19-year-old, who gave his name as Moro, was one of few Raqqa natives to witness the aftermath of the battle for the Syrian city. Victory celebrations by Kurdish forces felt muted - there were no civilians left. It was the “liberation” of a ghost town.

“Daesh is to blame for this,” said Moro, an Arab who joined the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces militia alliance (SDF) to fight Islamic State, known pejoratively as Daesh, after fleeing Raqqa two years before.

“But not everyone will see it that way. If destruction remains, people will blame the coalition, and maybe us.”

The cost of the campaign to oust Islamic State from its former Syrian capital is the destruction of the city, the death and maiming of hundreds of civilians and displacement of tens of thousands.

As the dust settles, Raqqa’s traumatized population fears new violence.

Rebuilding Raqqa, which resembles wrecked Syrian cities like Aleppo and Homs, will take years, meaning long-term homelessness for many - an issue already fuelling resentment against the forces that helped end Islamic State’s detested “caliphate”.

SDF supporters worry resentment will turn into unrest, pitting them against those who were more sympathetic to Islamic State, or who oppose what is increasingly perceived as Kurdish control of the majority Arab city.

The flags of the Kurdish YPG militia that spearheads the SDF were the first to fly above former Islamic State strongholds in Raqqa. Fighters chanted Kurdish slogans. The SDF declared the city would become part of Kurdish-led autonomy plans for northern Syria.

Many residents welcomed the U.S.-backed militias even as air strikes killed their relatives, saying the SDF at least treated them well.

But euphoria is giving way to a realization there is nothing for most to go back to. The U.S. State Department says it could be months if not longer before mines and debris are cleared and people can return.

Officials say frustration will be exploited by the SDF’s enemies: Turkey, which is fighting a Kurdish insurgency of its own, and President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to retake all of Syria.

Raqqa has in turn been controlled by Assad, rebel groups and then the jihadists in Syria’s six-year-old conflict. The forces now in control promise democracy and the council staffed by locals plans to hold elections.

“We’re done with Daesh. The regime can’t return either,” Moro said, referring to Assad’s Damascus-based government.

He stood at the spot where Islamic State whipped him 130 times for missing prayers. He and his brother spied on the group for the U.S. coalition by secretly filming key locations before his brother was found out and executed, he said.

‘KURDS ALLOWED IN’

Signs of Islamic State’s brutality litter Raqqa. Fighters last week searched a former prison set up underneath Raqqa stadium. Some cells were not big enough to sit up in.

On Naeem roundabout, where jihadists held public executions, a local woman said she once counted 77 decapitated heads on spikes.

Some 260,000 people fled the fighting. For now, most live in crowded camps and abandoned buildings with barely any water, electricity, food or medicine.

Those who fled abroad are unlikely to return, relatives say.

The few locals to see Raqqa after the expulsion of Islamic State include SDF fighters and civilians who did not flee. Others are desperate to get in.

At a checkpoint on Raqqa’s outskirts, a crowd of people displaced for months argued with militiamen, demanding to inspect their houses.

“They say the area’s mined. It’s not, people have been across. You need connections. Kurds are allowed in,” Sara Hussein, 58, said.

“Has Raqqa not been freed? It’s over. We saw the parades on TV - we want to go home.”

The SDF did not immediately comment but says it fairly represents all ethnicities in areas it controls.

The residents wanted to fetch winter clothes, worrying properties would be looted. One man said the SDF questioned him and confiscated his papers.

EMPLOYEES OF THE CALIPHATE

Others have been more thoroughly interrogated. They are among those Moro fears will resent the SDF.

A former Islamic State employee, who gave his name as Abu Furqan, was pushed out of Raqqa on his wheelchair by neighbours as they fled.

The 23-year-old had lost both legs in an air strike in August, and sat outside a mosque asking Red Crescent workers for painkillers. His wounds had been sewn up in an Islamic State clinic. Raqqa has no working hospitals.

“I did odd jobs for Daesh - manning police checkpoints, and driving around distributing water to fighters. Will I be interrogated again?” he said.

Islamic State wages were good, he said.

He avoided questions about whether he still sympathized with jihadists or opposed the SDF, replying: “When Daesh first came, some people were more afraid of what the U.S. reaction would be,” a reference to air strikes.

The final days of the battle for Raqqa were marked by tension between the coalition and tribal leaders who demanded air strikes stop for the sake of trapped civilians while they negotiated safe exit for some militants, council officials said.

One tribal leader said the coalition should compensate bereaved families.

For now, people just want to return.

Moro kept muttering: “It’s destroyed.”","After Islamic State, ruined Raqqa fears new strife",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/after-islamic-state-ruined-raqqa-fears-new-strife-idUSKBN1CV245

Herrera had said after the defeat, United’s first to the Terriers since 1952, that the home side had played with “more passion” than the 20-times Premier League champions.

Mourinho was irked by the 28-year-old’s comments but Herrera said ahead of United’s league clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday that there was no rift with the Portuguese.

”We have a fantastic relationship,“ the Spaniard said. ”But what I said was that in the first 30 minutes they had a better attitude than us.

”That’s what happened. But after that we had a good attitude and we were even close to drawing the game, which is not so easy after playing bad the first 30 minutes.

“We want to forget what happened... we want to move forward for a massive game against Tottenham and try to win.”

Second-placed United and Tottenham are level on 20 points in the table after Mauricio Pochettino’s side beat Liverpool 4-1. The London side suffered a midweek hiccup losing 3-2 to West Ham United in the League Cup while United beat Swansea City 2-0.

Herrera said United were not taking their rivals lightly and pointed to Tottenham’s 1-1 away draw with European champions Real Madrid last week to highlight their threat.

”It is a tough game and Tottenham is a direct rival for the title. In the last two or three years they have improved a lot and they are contenders for everything.

“Die Rückkehr zu einer normalen Geldpolitik hat begonnen”, sagte KfW-Chefvolkswirt Jörg Zeuner. EZB-Chef Mario Draghi habe den Anlegern vor allem Planungssicherheit für die kommenden Monate gegeben, sagte Fonds-Manager Thomas Altmann vom Vermögensverwalter QC Partners.

Die Europäische Zentralbank halbierte das Volumen ihres umstrittenen Anleihekaufprogramms auf 30 Milliarden Euro monatlich, verlängerte es aber bis mindestens September 2018. Das enttäuschte Euro-Anleger, die mit einem stärkeren Signal der Währungshüter gerechnet hatten. Die Gemeinschaftswährung rutschte um gut ein Prozent auf ein Drei-Wochen-Tief von 1,1687 Dollar ab. Das gab den Aktienmärkten einen kräftigen Schub, denn durch einen schwächeren Euro steigen die Exportchancen der Firmen auf dem Weltmarkt. Für den Dax bedeutete das ein Plus von 1,4 Prozent, der EuroStoxx50 legte 1,3 Prozent auf 3637,20 Zähler zu.

Experten kritisierten, der Kurswechsel der EZB gehe nicht weit genug. “Die Verringerung der Anleihekäufe war angesichts der kräftigen Erholung der Eurozone überfällig, die Drosselung ist aber zu gering ausgefallen”, monierte Volkswirt Friedrich Zimmermann vom ZEW-Institut. Der Gesamtumfang des Anleihekauf-Programms zur Ankurbelung der Konjunktur erhöht sich um 270 Milliarden auf 2,55 Billionen Euro. Den seit März 2016 bei null Prozent liegenden Leitzins tasteten die Währungshüter nicht an.

GIBT ES NEUWAHLEN IN KATALONIEN ODER NICHT?

An der Börse in Spanien trieben Anleger Spekulationen über Neuwahlen in Katalonien um. Der katalanische Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont erklärte zwar kurz vor Handelsschluss in Europa, er habe diese Gedanken wieder verworfen. Der Leitindex in Madrid zog dennoch um 1,9 Prozent an. Auch spanische Anleihen waren gefragt.

Die Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen der wirtschaftlich starken Region machen Anleger seit Wochen nervös. Sie befürchten, dass bei einem Erfolg der katalanischen Separatisten Regionen in anderen Ländern eine Abspaltung anstreben und damit die Zukunft der Europäischen Union (EU) gefährden.

Both players knew a win would secure a passage to the semi-finals as they held identical 1-1 records in White Group play at the season-ending event but the 37-year-old was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court to progress.

Muguruza had brushed aside Williams to claim her second grand slam title in July but any hopes she had of repeating the feat were snuffed out by a resolute opponent, who simply refused to buckle in the tense Singapore Indoor Stadium encounter.

“I played an amazing opponent who has had an amazing year so I was so happy to win the last point,” Williams said in a courtside interview.

The victory enabled Williams, who won this event in 2008, to advance along with pool winner Karolina Pliskova, who won her first two matches but ended round-robin play with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko earlier on Thursday.

The winner-takes-all showdown started with Williams looking to dictate terms, pushing Muguruza around the court and attacking her second serve as the Spaniard countered by pushing the American back with her deep groundstrokes.

The 37-year-old continued to pick away at the Muguruza serve but an ace and a string of big forehand winners helped stave off the early threat as both combatants took the fight to each other in a high-class encounter.

The pair traded service breaks before Muguruza failed to hold on and send the opener into a tiebreak when Williams converted her third set point after the back-peddling Spaniard dumped a forehand into the net.

OSTAPENKO VICTORIOUS

Muguruza’s repeated attempts to pull clear in the second were denied by Williams on every occasion with the American twice battling back from behind to edge 5-4 ahead with her strongest service game of the set.

The American made a concerted push for victory in the 10th game and sealed a memorable victory after an hour and 41 minutes when Muguruza sent another feeble forehand into the net.

“It’s not easy out here, you have to play every point well or you end up losing the game. I had some great coaching going into my match and I hope I can win some more,” Williams added.

Earlier, Ostapenko ended her maiden WTA Finals campaign on a winning note with a surprisingly easy victory over a subdued Pliskova, the Latvian saving her best until last after she was eliminated earlier in the week.

World number three Pliskova won her opening two matches against Williams and Muguruza to book a semi-final berth but the Czech was out-gunned by an inspired French Open champion in 66 minutes.

Ostapenko had battled hard in her opening matches to no avail, especially in a grueling three-set loss to Williams, but she served brilliantly against Pliskova and found the corners with her booming forehand to end her season with a win.

“Yes, I lost my earlier two matches but it’s my first time here and I am just happy to finish my season here, in the top eight, especially with a win at the end,” Ostapenko said.

Caroline Wozniacki has already advanced from the Red Group with one round of matches remaining, while Simona Halep, Caroline Garcia and Elina Svitolina can all still qualify alongside the Dane when play concludes in that pool on Friday.",Venus stuns Muguruza to advance at WTA Finals,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CV1BI-OCASP

Live national television showed MPs tumbling into a hedge at Nairobi’s Panafric Hotel when the two sides clashed after attempting to hold near-simultaneous news conferences at the same venue. One lawmaker shouted profanities on camera, prompting nervous giggles from anchors.

The fistfight reflected larger tensions within the country, that saw polling stations in some counties unable to open after opposition leader Raila Odinga called for a boycott of the Oct. 26 poll, saying it would not be free and fair.

Odinga’s withdrawal left President Uhuru Kenyatta as the only serious contender for the presidency, although six other candidates were also on the ballot. Kenyatta won a presidential poll on Aug. 8 that was later nullified by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds.

“They (the government MPs) came here, instead of addressing their own issues, they started attacked Raila,” Anthony Oluoch, opposition MP for Mathare constituency, told Reuters at the Panafric Hotel after the brawl.

“I was not engaging in physical violence, I was attacked by more than 10 or 15 people.”

Opposition MPs said a joke against Odinga from Senator Kipchumba Murkomen from the ruling Jubilee party sparked the brawl, but the senator blamed the other side for the violence.

“We met the ODM (opposition) MPs in the gallery, they asked me to buy them drinks, I bought them drinks. These people are just violent,” he said.","Kenya opposition, ruling party MPs exchange blows at rival news conferences",https://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-election-brawl/kenya-opposition-ruling-party-mps-exchange-blows-at-rival-news-conferences-idINKBN1CV2R9?il=0

The Reserve Bank of India asked the lender to account for 63.55 billion rupees ($980.3 million) more bad loans after a risk-based supervision exercise for the last financial year to March.

The action meant a 12.2 billion-rupee addition to the bank’s bad loans in the three months to Sept.30, as Chief Executive Rana Kapoor said they had already “resolved” 81 percent of the extra bad loans RBI had asked them to account for.

Kapoor called the rise in bad loans a “temporary setback”, adding there were steps “well under way to contain this number, to reduce this number.”

The regulator had earlier asked Yes Bank’s bigger rival Axis Bank to account for extra bad loans, while second-biggest lender HDFC Bank was also asked to reclassify one loan account as non-performing after the RBI’s directions.

Soured loans in India’s banking sector hit a record $145 billion at the end of June, but 21 state-owned banks account for majority of the stressed loans.

Yes Bank’s net profit in the September quarter rose to 10.03 billion rupees ($154.72 million), slightly lower than the 10.27 billion rupees on average expected by analysts.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans jumped to 1.82 percent at end-September from 0.97 percent a quarter earlier and 0.83 percent in the year-ago period.

Loans grew almost 35 percent in the September quarter, Yes Bank said, at a much faster pace that the system loan growth of just about 7 percent.

Ahead of the results, Yes Bank shares closed 1.3 percent higher in a Mumbai market that gained 0.5 percent. The stock has risen about 43 percent so far in 2017.

The typical male full-time employee in Britain earned 9.1 percent more than a full-time female employee, down from 9.4 percent a year earlier and the lowest since the survey started in 1997, when the gap was 17.4 percent.

Pay differences have attracted significant public attention in Britain over the past year and from next year large businesses will be required to publish figures on them.

Prime Minister Theresa May said in July that the BBC needed to tackle the gap in pay between its top male and female presenters, after a report showed very high salaries paid to a handful of male stars.

The headline figure provided by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday does not compare men and women doing equivalent jobs with similar experience and qualifications.

Instead, the difference in median hourly pay partly reflects the fact that men are more likely to work in highly paid fields, such as managerial roles, while areas such as administration and caring have a mostly female workforce and lower average pay.

Age also plays a big role. The headline figures show little difference between the pay of typical male and female full-time employees aged between 20 and 40, with men earning on average just 2-3 percent more on a median basis.

However, the gap between men and women in their forties jumps to 14 percent and rises to 16 percent for full-time employees aged between 50 and 59.

“This is likely to be connected with patterns of return to work after having children, in particular any differences between men and women in timing and nature of returning to the labour market,” the ONS said.

The data shows women in their thirties who work part-time earn a significant premium over men, unlike at earlier ages - possibly reflecting women in relatively well-paid fields moving from full-time to part-time work after childbirth.

However, women who work part-time do not earn much more than part-time men if they are in their forties, and earn less in their fifties and sixties.

Thursday’s figures came as part of a broad annual survey of British wages, based on pay data reported by companies to tax authorities. They paint a similar picture on overall trends as the ONS’s less comprehensive monthly figures.

Pay in April 2017, the period covered by Thursday’s survey, was 2.2 percent a year higher in cash terms, the same growth as in 2016. However, adjusted for consumer price inflation pay was 0.4 percent lower than a year before and 4.7 percent below its peak in 2008, before the financial crisis.

LMC maintained its full-year forecast for new vehicle sales in 2017 of 17.1 million units.

October U.S. new vehicle sales will be about 1.32 million units, a drop of almost 3.7 percent from 1.37 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.

The forecast was based on the first 17 selling days of October. Automakers will release U.S. sales results for the month on Nov. 1.

Major automakers’ U.S. new vehicle sales climbed to a monthly high for the year in September as consumers replaced flood-damaged cars after Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas in late August.[nL2N1ME0SD]

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for October will be 17.6 million vehicles, down more than 1 percent from 17.8 million units in the same month in 2016, the consultancies said.

Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were also set to decline more than 4 percent in October.

U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy.

Consumer discounts hit a monthly record of $3,901, above the previous record of $3,835 set in October 2016.

“While incentives have declined from the record high set last month, the need to reduce inventory could push spending to a new all-time high level in the final months of the year,” said Thomas King, J.D. Power’s senior vice president for data and analytics.

Discounts as a percentage of the manufacturer’s recommended sale price hit 10.5 percent in October, as they have for 15 of the last 16 months. Consumer discounts of more than 10 percent are considered unhealthy for automakers in the long term as they undermine resale values.

Despite the lofty consumer discounts, the average new vehicle sold in October spent 75 days in inventory. This was the longest since July 2009, during the height of the Great Recession.",U.S. October new vehicle sales seen down 4 pct on year: J.D.

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

Os empréstimos tomados pela CCEE em nome das distribuidoras somaram 21,75 bilhões, em operações contratadas em 2014 e 2015.","SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - As distribuidoras de eletricidade do país têm sofrido com custos maiores do que arrecadam junto aos consumidores nas contas de luz, e a situação deve permanecer mesmo após uma elevação no valor das bandeiras tarifárias que pesam sobre as faturas, disse à Reuters o presidente da associação que representa investidores do setor.

A Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel) aprovou nesta semana uma alta de quase 40 por cento nos custos da bandeira tarifária vermelha nível 2, atualmente vigente devido à falta de chuva na área dos reservatórios das hidrelétricas, principal fonte de energia do Brasil.

Criadas em 2015, as bandeiras tarifárias geram uma cobrança adicional nas contas quando a oferta de energia é baixa, para incentivar um consumo menor e ao mesmo tempo arrecadar recursos para que as distribuidoras paguem pela geração de termelétricas mais caras, que têm sido acionadas devido à situação crítica das usinas hídricas.

O presidente da Associação Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia Elétrica (Abradee), Nelson Leite, afirmou que a mudança nas bandeiras tarifárias gera uma receita adicional de cerca de 1 bilhão de reais para as distribuidoras até o final do ano, enquanto o custo estimado com a compra de energia térmica no período é de cerca de 6 bilhões de reais.

“Só isso não resolve o problema. Serão necessárias medidas adicionais”, disse Leite.

Ele afirmou que as distribuidoras já apresentaram uma proposta à Aneel para resolver o déficit de caixa com o menor impacto possível sobre os consumidores, mas ainda assim o problema poderá gerar elevações adicionais nas tarifas.

O cenário deve-se basicamente ao baixo nível dos reservatórios das usinas hídricas, que exige um uso mais intenso de termelétricas que o esperado inicialmente, com custos mais elevados e que não estavam previstos nas tarifas.

Segundo Leite, existe o risco de as distribuidoras não terem recursos para pagar a energia gerada pelas termelétricas.

As distribuidoras devem pagar as térmicas em 8 e 9 de novembro, quando a Câmara de Comercialização de Energia Elétrica (CCEE) realizará a liquidação das operações do mercado de energia referentes a setembro.

“Estamos pedindo para postergar a liquidação, do início para o final do mês, para dar mais tempo de as distribuidoras arrecadarem. Estamos sugerindo no último dia útil de novembro”, disse Leite.

As distribuidoras também querem convencer a Aneel a repassar a elas recursos de um fundo setorial, a Conta de Energia de Reserva, abastecida com recursos gerados pela venda da energia de usinas de energia renovável contratadas pelo governo nos chamados “leilões de reserva”.

Leite estimou que o fundo setorial poderia liberar cerca de 1 bilhão de reais adicionais para as distribuidoras.

Mesmo com essas medidas, segundo o dirigente da Abradee, algumas concessionárias ainda podem precisar de um reajuste extraordinário de tarifas para fechar o ano.

“Ainda não resolve a situação de algumas distribuidoras... nesse caso, estaríamos falando de uma revisão extraordinária... para que a distribuidora possa se reequilibrar e evitar uma situação de inadimplência”, afirmou o dirigente, sem citar empresas.

MERCADO TRAVADO?

Uma inadimplência de distribuidoras teria potencial de praticamente travar o mercado de energia, uma vez que a liquidação financeira de operações realizada mensalmente pela CCEE já vem apresentando elevados valores em abertos desde meados de 2015.

Em outubro, quando foram liquidadas as operações referentes a agosto, a CCEE conseguiu arrecadar apenas 2,54 bilhões de reais, de 6,82 bilhões cobrados junto aos agentes de mercado.

A maior parte dos valores não pagos, ou 3,7 bilhões de reais, está associada também à menor geração das hidrelétricas. Isso porque empresas que operam usinas hídricas conseguiram liminares na Justiça que as livram de arcar com os débitos.

O governo tem buscado um acordo para acabar com a briga judicial, e uma proposta nesse sentido deve constar de uma medida provisória em preparação no Ministério de Minas e Energia.

CRISE SE REPETE

A Aneel irá analisar os pleitos das distribuidoras em reunião de diretoria na próxima terça-feira, segundo pauta do encontro divulgada nesta quinta-feira pela agência.

Para Leite, da Abradee, a situação lembra uma crise de fluxo de caixa enfrentada pelas distribuidoras em 2014, também devido a uma elevada geração térmica necessária naquele ano.

Na época, o governo da então presidente Dilma Rousseff chegou a autorizar a CCEE a contratar empréstimos bilionários junto a bancos em nome das empresas do setor.

“É uma situação semelhante, mas em proporção menor”, apontou Leite.

Os empréstimos tomados pela CCEE em nome das distribuidoras somaram 21,75 bilhões, em operações contratadas em 2014 e 2015. O custo do pagamento desses financiamentos será repassado às tarifas até 2020.","Tarifa de energia não cobre custo mesmo com alta em bandeiras, dizem distribuidoras",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CV2PR-OBRTP

Pending home contracts are viewed as a forward-looking indicator for the state of the housing market because they become sales one or two months later.

Although the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, the housing sector has faltered this year. Home sales have weakened amid tight inventories while builders have cited shortages of land and labor as a curb on construction.

We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.
Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”.","RIYADH (Reuters) - The $500 billion mega-city planned by Saudi Arabia will be floated on financial markets alongside oil giant Saudi Aramco as part of the kingdom’s drive to diversify away from oil, the crown prince told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also said Aramco’s initial public offering is on track for next year and the national oil giant could be valued at more than $2 trillion - a sum some investors have said appears unrealistically high.

His surprise announcement about the listing of NEOM, a 26,500-square km (10,230-square mile) zone that will extend into Jordan and Egypt, is the latest and most extraordinary in a slate of privatization programs led by the floating of Aramco.

The futuristic high tech hub looks set to become a flagship of reforms championed by Prince Mohammed to create jobs, encourage entrepreneurs and permit new freedoms among Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and dependence on the state.

“The first capitalist city in the world ... this is the unique thing that will be revolutionary,” said Prince Mohammed, heir to the throne of the largest Arab economy, an absolute monarchy.

“Without a doubt, at the end of the day NEOM will be floated in the markets. The first zone floated in the public markets. It’s as if you float the city of New York.”

The 32-year-old spoke on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference, which has attracted nearly 4,000 delegates from around the world to Riyadh this week.

On Aramco’s IPO, he said: “We are on track in 2018... but the listing (details) are still under discussion ... It will be IPO-ed in 2018.”

Switching between English and Arabic, sometimes in the same sentence, the prince seemed most excited discussing his plans for the new city.

FOCUS ON GROWTH

Adjacent to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the Suez Canal, the zone will serve as a gateway to the proposed King Salman Bridge, which will link Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

NEOM will be fully owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) until its listing, and will attract investments from companies in renewable energy, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, the PIF has said.

“It won’t be listed in the markets until the idea is mature enough,” Prince Mohammed said. “It might be after 2030, it might be before, but the idea and the strategy is to float it eventually.”

The new city will not follow the rules and regulations enforced in the rest of Saudi Arabia, which imposes sharia law based on a strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.

It will offer residents a more liberal lifestyle, allowing musical concerts and entertainment in a remote corner of the desert kingdom. Saudi Arabia has already started to relax some long-standing rules, including what was an effective ban on women driving.

Prince Mohammed said the city could appoint a board of directors and government (chief executive) whose only responsibility will be to stimulate economic activity.

“In New York, the governor is appointed to meet certain needs, including growth, but in NEOM the governor (CEO) doesn’t have to deal with any of those problems. He only has growth in mind.”

He said the name mixed “neo”, meaning new, with M, the first letter of the Arabic word for future.

The new city is part of the crown prince’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, and provide jobs for an overwhelmingly young population in the face of a global oil price decline since 2014.

Prince Mohammed has portrayed the reforms as a matter of economic survival, but one challenge for the ruling Al Saud family has been to secure the acquiescence of traditionalist clerics upon whose support the family relies for legitimacy.

Some clergy suspect the bold initiatives conceived by the prince in leisure and tourism presage sweeping reforms in education, a bastion of conservatism where clerical control is believed by Western critics to have encouraged Islamist radicals not just in Saudi Arabia but across the Muslim and Arab worlds.

But the prince has pushed ahead, confident he has the backing of most young Saudis, who make up the bulk of the population.

“I do think there is a desire within significant parts of Saudi society to move away from rigid, old-school Wahhabi control of social behavior and the public sphere,” said Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics.“So I don’t think the Crown Prince’s statements are just for show. He genuinely wants to harness these sentiments and has undertaken very significant steps, including allowing women to drive and severely curtailing the powers of the religious police.”

Economic growth has slowed and the economy may shrink this year as the government introduces austerity measures.

“The idea is not to restructure the economy as much as to seize the opportunities available that we didn’t address before. We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.

He became next in line for the throne in June after the king, his father, removed a more senior prince from the succession. He has pledged to transform Saudi Arabia economically and socially.

“Vision 2030 is about a lot of big opportunities, so Aramco is one of them, NEOM another opportunity ... We have a lot of huge projects we will announce in the next few years.”

He said the PIF would generate higher returns than other big investment funds. The kingdom had made a 20 percent profit in five months with the SoftBank Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund. “That’s why we established a $50-billion-fund in Blackstone, which is expected to make a 14 pct profit.”

QATAR AND YEMEN

Prince Mohammed also said Saudi Arabia’s dispute with neighboring Qatar had not affected investment.

“Qatar is a very, very, very small issue,” he said.

Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”. Qatar denies the allegations.

Prince Mohammed said the kingdom’s war in Yemen would continue in order to prevent the armed Houthi movement from turning into another “Hezbollah” on Saudi Arabia’s southern border.

“We’re pursuing until we can be sure that nothing will happen there like Hezbollah again, because Yemen is more dangerous than Lebanon,” he said.

Hezbollah, armed and backed by Iran, has become a formidable force in Lebanon and Syria. The Houthis also reportedly receive arms and training from Iran, Riyadh’s arch-rival.

Yemen’s location is crucial, said Prince Mohammed. “It’s next to Bab al-Mandab so if something happens there, that means 10 percent of world trade stops,” he added, referring to the strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

L‘objectif de cette réforme étant d‘élargir une partie du financement de la protection sociale au-delà des seuls actifs, la hausse ne sera pas non plus compensée pour les 60% de retraités ayant les revenus les plus élevés, c‘est-à-dire ceux dont la pension est au moins égale à 1.400 euros par mois pour une personne seule de plus de 65 ans.

Cette perspective, qui a déjà conduit les retraités dans la rue fin septembre, a cristallisé les critiques de l‘opposition, à la fois de gauche et de droite, la plupart des groupes parlementaires s‘opposant à cette réforme dans son ensemble.

“Vous opérez des transferts de pouvoir d‘achat entre catégories de Français”, a dit Jean-Pierre Door (Les Républicains). “Nous n‘acceptons pas ce tour de passe-passe”, a-t-il ajouté.

Pierre Dharréville (Parti communiste) et Caroline Fiat (La France insoumise) ont également dénoncé un dispositif qui “remet en cause le principe de la cotisation et les fondements de notre système de protection sociale et de la Sécurité sociale elle-même”.

Le ministre de l‘Action et des Comptes publics, Gérald Darmanin, a affirmé que “seuls 30% des retraités vont connaître une perte de pouvoir d‘achat”.

Après le vote de cet article, les députés examineront celui qui transforme, à compter de 2019, le Crédit d‘impôt compétitivité emploi (CICE) en allègement pérenne de 6% des cotisations sociales des entreprises pour les rémunérations n‘excédant pas 2,5 fois le SMIC.

Environ un millier d‘amendements ont été déposés sur ce PLFSS qui compte une soixantaine d‘articles. L‘examen par les députés devrait s‘achever dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, un vote solennel sur l‘ensemble du texte étant prévu le mardi 31 octobre.",La hausse de la CSG adoptée par l'Assemblée,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CV0L0-OFRTP

Other reports on Thursday, however, offered a less favorable look at the economy. The goods trade deficit widened in September and retail inventories fell, prompting the Atlanta Federal Reserve to trim its third-quarter GDP growth estimate. In addition, signed contracts to buy previously-owned homes were unchanged last month.

“Firms remain unwilling to release labor. The labor market is very tight,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, the Labor Department said. Claims fell to 223,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since March 1973.

Economists had forecast claims rising to 235,000 in the latest week. They have declined from the almost three-year high of 298,000 hit at the start of September in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.

The impact of Harvey and Irma has largely dropped out of the claims data for the mainland United States. But Irma and Hurricane Maria continue to impact claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, now virtually isolated because of the destruction of infrastructure due to the storms.

A Labor Department official said claims data for the islands had continued to be estimated.

Last week marked the 138th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,000 to 239,500 last week.

That suggests a sharp rebound in job growth in October after nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September.

LABOR MARKET SLACK DIMINISHING

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 3,000 to 1.90 million in the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500 to 1.90 million, the lowest reading since January 1974. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which October’s unemployment rate will be derived.

The four-week average of continuing claims fell 40,500 between the September and October survey weeks, suggesting a further improvement in the unemployment rate as labor market slack continues to diminish. The job market strength supports the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors digested the European Central Bank’s announcement that it would extend its bond purchases at a reduced rate. The dollar .DXY rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries were largely unchanged. Stocks on Wall Street rose.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit rose 1.3 percent to $64.1 billion in September. Exports of goods increased $0.9 billion to $129.6 billion. Goods imports gained $1.7 billion to $193.7 billion amid a surge in capital and consumer goods imports, which likely reflects the economy’s underlying strength.

The Commerce Department also said wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent last month. But stocks of goods at retailers tumbled 1.0 percent, weighed down by a 2.6 percent dive in motor vehicle inventories. As a result, the Atlanta Fed lowered its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate.

“The higher-than-expected trade deficit implies a lower contribution from the net exports,” said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. “In addition, today’s weak inventories data also imply a lower contribution from this subcomponent.”

The government will publish it’s advance estimate of third-quarter GDP on Friday. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the April-June quarter.

Saudi Arabia has already started to relax some long-standing rules, including what was an effective ban on women driving.

We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.
Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”.","RIYADH (Reuters) - The $500 billion mega-city planned by Saudi Arabia will be floated on financial markets alongside oil giant Saudi Aramco as part of the kingdom’s drive to diversify away from oil, the crown prince told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also said Aramco’s initial public offering is on track for next year and the national oil giant could be valued at more than $2 trillion - a sum some investors have said appears unrealistically high.

His surprise announcement about the listing of NEOM, a 26,500-square km (10,230-square mile) zone that will extend into Jordan and Egypt, is the latest and most extraordinary in a slate of privatization programs led by the floating of Aramco.

The futuristic high tech hub looks set to become a flagship of reforms championed by Prince Mohammed to create jobs, encourage entrepreneurs and permit new freedoms among Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and dependence on the state.

“The first capitalist city in the world ... this is the unique thing that will be revolutionary,” said Prince Mohammed, heir to the throne of the largest Arab economy, an absolute monarchy.

“Without a doubt, at the end of the day NEOM will be floated in the markets. The first zone floated in the public markets. It’s as if you float the city of New York.”

The 32-year-old spoke on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference, which has attracted nearly 4,000 delegates from around the world to Riyadh this week.

On Aramco’s IPO, he said: “We are on track in 2018... but the listing (details) are still under discussion ... It will be IPO-ed in 2018.”

Switching between English and Arabic, sometimes in the same sentence, the prince seemed most excited discussing his plans for the new city.

FOCUS ON GROWTH

Adjacent to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the Suez Canal, the zone will serve as a gateway to the proposed King Salman Bridge, which will link Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

NEOM will be fully owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) until its listing, and will attract investments from companies in renewable energy, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, the PIF has said.

“It won’t be listed in the markets until the idea is mature enough,” Prince Mohammed said. “It might be after 2030, it might be before, but the idea and the strategy is to float it eventually.”

The new city will not follow the rules and regulations enforced in the rest of Saudi Arabia, which imposes sharia law based on a strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.

It will offer residents a more liberal lifestyle, allowing musical concerts and entertainment in a remote corner of the desert kingdom. Saudi Arabia has already started to relax some long-standing rules, including what was an effective ban on women driving.

Prince Mohammed said the city could appoint a board of directors and government (chief executive) whose only responsibility will be to stimulate economic activity.

“In New York, the governor is appointed to meet certain needs, including growth, but in NEOM the governor (CEO) doesn’t have to deal with any of those problems. He only has growth in mind.”

He said the name mixed “neo”, meaning new, with M, the first letter of the Arabic word for future.

The new city is part of the crown prince’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, and provide jobs for an overwhelmingly young population in the face of a global oil price decline since 2014.

Prince Mohammed has portrayed the reforms as a matter of economic survival, but one challenge for the ruling Al Saud family has been to secure the acquiescence of traditionalist clerics upon whose support the family relies for legitimacy.

Some clergy suspect the bold initiatives conceived by the prince in leisure and tourism presage sweeping reforms in education, a bastion of conservatism where clerical control is believed by Western critics to have encouraged Islamist radicals not just in Saudi Arabia but across the Muslim and Arab worlds.

But the prince has pushed ahead, confident he has the backing of most young Saudis, who make up the bulk of the population.

“I do think there is a desire within significant parts of Saudi society to move away from rigid, old-school Wahhabi control of social behavior and the public sphere,” said Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics.“So I don’t think the Crown Prince’s statements are just for show. He genuinely wants to harness these sentiments and has undertaken very significant steps, including allowing women to drive and severely curtailing the powers of the religious police.”

Economic growth has slowed and the economy may shrink this year as the government introduces austerity measures.

“The idea is not to restructure the economy as much as to seize the opportunities available that we didn’t address before. We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.

He became next in line for the throne in June after the king, his father, removed a more senior prince from the succession. He has pledged to transform Saudi Arabia economically and socially.

“Vision 2030 is about a lot of big opportunities, so Aramco is one of them, NEOM another opportunity ... We have a lot of huge projects we will announce in the next few years.”

He said the PIF would generate higher returns than other big investment funds. The kingdom had made a 20 percent profit in five months with the SoftBank Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund. “That’s why we established a $50-billion-fund in Blackstone, which is expected to make a 14 pct profit.”

QATAR AND YEMEN

Prince Mohammed also said Saudi Arabia’s dispute with neighboring Qatar had not affected investment.

“Qatar is a very, very, very small issue,” he said.

Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”. Qatar denies the allegations.

Prince Mohammed said the kingdom’s war in Yemen would continue in order to prevent the armed Houthi movement from turning into another “Hezbollah” on Saudi Arabia’s southern border.

“We’re pursuing until we can be sure that nothing will happen there like Hezbollah again, because Yemen is more dangerous than Lebanon,” he said.

Hezbollah, armed and backed by Iran, has become a formidable force in Lebanon and Syria. The Houthis also reportedly receive arms and training from Iran, Riyadh’s arch-rival.

Yemen’s location is crucial, said Prince Mohammed. “It’s next to Bab al-Mandab so if something happens there, that means 10 percent of world trade stops,” he added, referring to the strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government’s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law.

But it has faced widespread criticism from members of parliament of all parties - including May’s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit.

As a result, the bill’s passage through parliament will depend on May’s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel MPs who said they were “deadly serious” about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit.

The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.

The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some MPs, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.

“Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,” a Brexit department spokeswoman said.

“We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.”

Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for “Brexit day” on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country’s laws.

He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle.

May’s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required.

DEADLY SERIOUS

Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative MPs to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.

One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill. “We are deadly serious,” Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.

Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer MPs a vote on the final exit package.

The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow MPs to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal.

Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification.

Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU’s preferred negotiating timetable.

Despite his clarification, MPs signalled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives MPs a greater say.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index rose 1.1 percent to 391.45 points with heavy gains across most sectors and trading centers, particularly in Germany where the DAX .GDAXI touched an all time closing high with a 1.4 percent rise.

The euro’s tumble provided European stocks with their biggest gains in over six weeks, as the ECB’s Mario Draghi said the bank would extend asset purchases until at least September 2018 at a reduced pace.

“Anything that suggests the euro isn’t going up in a straight line is potentially good news for European equities,” Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street, told Reuters.

Sandrine Perret, European Strategist at Credit Suisse, said the move was likely to continue to fuel the bull market.

“The decision should lead to further strength for European equities,” she wrote in a note, adding that strong economic growth should bolster corporate earnings.

Spain's IBEX .IBEX closed up 1.9 percent as hopes of a breakthrough in the Catalan crisis fueled optimism among investors.

While shares in retailer DIA (DIDA.MC) slumped 4.8 percent to a five-year low after it issued a profit warning, most Spanish blue-chips posted substantial gains, notably heavyweight banks such as Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) or Banco Santander (SAN.MC), both up 3.2 percent.

Nokia (NOKIA.HE) was the biggest faller on the STOXX, losing a spectacular 17.5 percent after the Finnish firm reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings.

“Difficult to say at this stage how much lower consensus could go given all the negative wording on 2018,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.

Barclays (BARC.L) tumbled 7.4 percent in its biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The British bank posted worse than expected profit before tax due to a weak trading performance by its investment bank.

Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) also reported a drop in investment bank revenue, although cost cuts lifted profit above analysts’ expectations. Its shares closed 0.9 percent lower. [nL8N1N110W]

Also in the banking sector, Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region biggest bank, sank 5.9 percent after saying it would miss its 2018 cost target and cut at least 6,000 jobs.

Heavy losses were offset by swings in positive territory like Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) which ended the day up 12 percent after raising its year-end outlook.

Other winners of the day included Finnish petroleum producer’s Neste (NESTE.HE), up 9 percent after its third-quarter results came in above expectations.

According to Thomson Reuters data, third-quarter earning growth expectations for the STOXX 600 have declined to 3.4 percent from around 10 percent expected in July.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 16 percent to $20.04 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. The company did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT.","Twitter says it could turn first-ever profit, shares surge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results/twitter-says-it-could-turn-first-ever-profit-shares-surge-idUKKBN1CV1JP

“Es ist ein erstes Zeichen der Entspannung, denn die türkische Regierung hat alle Zusagen eingehalten”, erklärte Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel. Entscheidenden Anteil hatte offenbar Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder, der laut Gabriel als Vermittler in die Türkei gereist war. Dem Auswärtigem Amt zufolge sind in dem Land noch zehn Deutsche aus politischen Gründen inhaftiert, darunter die Journalisten Deniz Yücel und Mesale Tolu. Ihr Schicksal ist ungewiss.

Berlins Regierender Bürgermeister Michael Müller sagte, Steudtner werde im Laufe des Donnerstages in der Stadt ankommen. Auf Wunsch seiner Familie solle dies im privaten Rahmen ohne Politik und Öffentlichkeit stattfinden. Auf dem Flughafen Tegel harrten dennoch seit den Morgenstunden zahllose Kamerateams aus. Spekulationen in Medien, Steudtner sei am Nachmittag an Bord einer Maschine der Turkish Airlines zurückgekehrt, wurden nicht bestätigt.

Steudtner war nach dem ersten Tag der Verhandlung gegen ihn und zehn weitere Beschuldigte in der Nacht zum Donnerstag in Istanbul gegen Kaution freigekommen. Mit ihm wurden sieben weitere Angeklagte vorläufig aus der Haft entlassen. Er war am 5. Juli bei einem Seminar unter dem Vorwurf der Mitgliedschaft in einer terroristischen Vereinigung festgenommen worden. Der Prozess soll am 22. November fortgesetzt werden. Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert erklärte, die Bundesregierung denke an diejenigen, die noch in Haft seien. Nach Angaben Gabriels wird an ihrer Freilassung gearbeitet.

“Ich bin Gerhard Schröder sehr dankbar für seine Vermittlung”, sagte Gabriel dem “Spiegel”. Dem Magazin zufolge reiste Schröder eine Woche nach der Bundestagswahl zum türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan, um mit ihm über Steudtner und die anderen deutschen Inhaftierten zu sprechen. Schröder habe im Auftrag der Bundesregierung vermittelt. Sein Büro teilte mit, der Ex-Kanzler freue sich über die Freilassung Steudtners.

TÜRKEI-VERHÄLTNIS THEMA BEI JAMAIKA-SONDIERUNG

Das Verhältnis Deutschlands zur Türkei dürfte auch in den Sondierungsgesprächen über eine Jamaika-Koalition ein umstrittenes Thema werden. Die Freilassung Steudtners könne nur ein erster Schritt sein, sagte FDP-Vizechef Wolfgang Kubicki. Auch Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir forderte die Freilassung weiterer Häftlinge: “Vorher kann es keinerlei Fortschritte und eine Normalisierung des Verhältnisses zur Türkei geben.” Der Grünen-Politiker ist für das Amt des Außenministers im Gespräch. Die seit langem stockenden EU-Beitrittsverhandlungen mit der Türkei will er nicht beenden. Für einen solchen Schritt plädierte indes Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann: “Die CSU war seit jeher der Auffassung, dass eine Vollmitgliedschaft der Türkei überhaupt nicht infrage kommt.”

Dass das Verhältnis zwischen den Nato-Partnern auf vielen Ebenen belastet ist, zeigen auch Angaben der Bundesregierung zur mutmaßlichen Spionage türkischer Agenten in Deutschland. Demzufolge hat die Bundesanwaltschaft in diesem Jahr elf Ermittlungsverfahren wegen möglicher Agententätigkeit für den Geheimdienst MIT in Deutschland eingeleitet. 2016 war es demnach nur eins. Bisher sei es zu keiner Verurteilung gekommen, teilte die Regierung auf eine Kleine Anfrage der Linken im Bundestag mit.

Die Türkei ging derweil erneut gegen mutmaßliche Unterstützer des Putschversuchs im Juli 2016 vor. Die Polizei startete einem Medienbericht zufolge landesweite Razzien, um Haftbefehle gegen 121 frühere Mitarbeiter des Außenministeriums zu vollstrecken. Ihnen werde vorgeworfen, in Verbindung mit dem Prediger Fethullah Gülen zu stehen. Die türkische Regierung macht ihn für den Putschversuch verantwortlich. Gülen weist die Vorwürfe zurück.

The BRC, which represents major retailers, said its members employed 3.0 percent fewer staff in the third quarter of this year than during the same time in 2016, and total hours worked fell by 4.2 percent year-on-year.

Both were the steepest falls since the BRC started collecting records in 2008, when Britain was in the middle of its sharpest recession in decades.

This contrasts with the picture in the broader economy, where the unemployment rate is its lowest since 1975 and job creation has been strong, albeit partly at the expense of wages.

Still, the BRC report chimed with a European Commission survey last month that showed British retailers’ expectations for employment sank to their lowest since late 2011.

“The pace of job reductions in the retail industry is gathering steam,” BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.

“Behind this shrinking of the workforce is both a technological revolution in retail, which is reducing demand for labor, and government policy, which is driving up the cost of employment,” she added.

Retail, which accounts for just under 10 percent of jobs in Britain, has a lot of low-paid jobs that have been affected by rapid rises in the minimum wage in recent years, as well as a new government training levies and pension requirements.

High-street retailers also face stiff competition from online stores, which typically need fewer staff, and supermarkets have increasingly been switching to customers scanning their own shopping, supervised by a handful of staff.

Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Britain’s second biggest supermarket group behind Tesco (TSCO.L), said last week it was seeking to cut up to 2,000 jobs, mainly in its payroll and human resources departments.

One silver lining of the fall in jobs was an increase in average pay for staff who remained, as productivity improved, the BRC said - a trend at odds with the lacklustre performance on jobs and productivity in other British industries.

“The challenge for retailers will be in maintaining the pace of productivity improvement as they come up against shortages of the skills needed for a new, digital-dependent industry,” Dickinson said.",UK retailers cut jobs at fastest rate since 2008: BRC,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-retail/uk-retailers-cut-jobs-at-fastest-rate-since-2008-brc-idUKKBN1CU3A5

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Those shortcomings, already acknowledged by judges and the election commission, are likely to trigger legal challenges.

In an address to supporters in central Nairobi, opposition leader Raila Odinga said he would take no part in the re-run because of a failure to replace election commission officials after the Supreme Court annulled the initial vote in August.

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans have been bracing for violence again. Odinga urged his supporters to stay at home and out of the way of police.

“We advise Kenyans who value democracy and justice to hold vigil and prayers away from polling stations, or just stay at home,” he said on Wednesday, to cheers from a 6,000-strong crowd.

In Odinga strongholds such as the western city of Kisumu, on the shores of Lake Victoria, there were no signs of polling stations being set up and the few election officials to be found were cowering in an empty community hall.

“Going out of that gate with this ballot box is like a suicide mission,” said Evans, a 26-year-old polling official who asked that his surname not be published.

Of the 400 polling station officials due to report for duty at Kisumu’s Lions Club High School, only 19 pitched up. Drivers meant to transport them to and from polling stations also failed to show.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, which has been accused of harrassing polling staff, is likely to present such absences as proof that the re-run, organised in less than 60 days, is illegitimate and bogus.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues. One election commissioner has quit and fled the country.

At his election-eve rally, Odinga said he would keep up the pressure for another re-run under the auspices of a new, reformed election commission within 90 days.

Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, has made clear he sees Thursday’s vote as legitimate.

Although Odinga has backed off from earlier calls for protests on election day, police are expected to be out in force, especially in Kisumu and Nairobi’s slums, where nearly 50 people have been killed by security forces since the August vote.

The election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, for whom Nairobi is a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

“I tell all our international partners that we will get through this,” Kenyatta said in an election-eve address in which he urged national unity to support flagging growth in what has been one of Africa’s most vibrant economies.

“We must return to work,” he said. “We cannot remain in a perpetual state of politicking.”",Opposition boycott overshadows Kenya election re-run,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CU2AN-OZATP

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

The company has been piloting such robots in a handful of stores.

“If you are running up and down the aisle, and you want to decide if we are out of Cheerios or not, a human doesn’t do that job very well and they don’t like it,” Chief Technology Officer Jeremy King told Reuters.

The robots are about 2 feet in size and come with a tower on their backs that is fitted with cameras, which scan aisles to check stocks, missing items and if products have been left in the wrong place by customers.

They are 50 percent more productive, can scan shelves three times faster than their human counterparts and significantly improve accuracy levels, King said. Store employees are only able to scan shelves about twice a week.

It said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January but also extend the buying program until the end of next September.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was recovering but still needed support.

“Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy,” he told a news conference. “Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.”

Designed nearly three years ago, the bond buys worth more than 2 trillion euros depressed borrowing costs and lifted growth but failed to raise inflation to the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent.

That forced the bank to hedge its bets with what some investors described as “dovish policy tightening”.

The ECB will now cut its bond buys in half to 30 billion euros a month from January given robust growth, it kept the option to raise or extend buys and promised to reinvest maturing funds for years to come.

It also promised banks ample liquidity and said the bond buys would not end suddenly, suggesting that another extension, even if only to gradually wind down purchases, is likely.

“This is not tapering, it’s just a down-size,” Draghi said, using the market term for beginning to exit a stimulus program.

“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly,” he added. “There is still a large amount of uncertainty.”

The cautious move may also have reflected policymakers' concern about the euro's appreciation against the dollar EUR= this year and their aim to keep the currency stable after its surge over the summer.

The euro fell nearly 0.8 percent on the day even as Draghi omitted a now customary reference about the need to monitor the currency.

“Today’s decision is the first real baby step towards a very gentle exit from the ECB’s crisis mode, but it is definitely not a big-bang u-turn,” ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

“In fact, the ... recalibration illustrates the ECB wants to start the exit as cautiously as possible, ideally without seeing the euro appreciate or bond yields increase.”

DILEMMA

The biggest debate appeared to be about whether to keep asset buys open ended, with Draghi highlighting dissent from hawks, who wanted the ECB pave the way to the exit.

Still, Draghi said there was a large majority for an open-ended program while other issues were supported by consensus or near consensus.

Hawks such as Germany and the Netherlands have argued that growth is now above trend and more purchases do next to nothing for inflation, so keeping the program open ended is not justified. Doves on the bloc’s periphery, however, warned that a quick exit could tighten financial conditions, undoing years of work.

“The fact that the ECB made the tapering decision look as dovish as possible because of the weak inflation causes a risk of a later move in rates than in our forecast,” Nordea economist Tuuli Koivu said.

“The possible first rate hike – even if only a cosmetic in nature - that we expect to see in the first quarter of 2019 may come later,” he added.

The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.

Draghi said data pointed to unabated growth as employment rises, households continue to spend and exports are on the upswing.

Yet, underlying inflation has not yet shown any convincing signs of an upwards trend and the outlook for both inflation and growth remained conditional on continued support from the ECB.

“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration,” Draghi said.

Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.

The ECB, meanwhile is slowly running out of bonds to buy, But Draghi dismissed arguments that scarcity of available debt would constrain the program as the ECB had plenty of flexibility.

Still, economists argue that the ECB will be nearing its limits by the end of its nine month extension, particularly in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, making another extension difficult without a major redesign of parameters.

“Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,” Draghi said.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

Only two people -- Sadat and Khaled Ali, a lawyer who challenged Sisi over a dispute about two islands in the Red Sea -- have publicly aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win.
Last election, Sisi won about 97 percent of the vote on a turnout of 47.5 percent, after voting was extended for a day.

Picture taken October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh

Four years ago, Sisi won a landslide victory after he led the military ouster of then president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, promising stability following Egypt’s 2011 Arab Spring uprising.

Sisi, 62, has yet to declare if he will run, though he is unlikely to face strong opposition. He says he will follow the people’s will, and many in Egypt still see him as key to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy.

But some critics say that narrative has been undercut by tough austerity reforms and a currency flotation that has made even the middle-class poorer, and an Islamic insurgency that has extended outside its battleground in the northern Sinai,

The “So You Can Build It” petition campaign launched by a businessman, professors and pro-Sisi independent lawmakers is looking to whip up turnout for Sisi and show he still has the legitimacy of a popular mandate.

Less than a month into the campaign, its founders claim they will rally massive support. A host of celebrities have signed up, posing on social media with petition forms that show Egypt’s red, white and black flag, and a silhouette of the pyramids.

“We will find out from the numbers we have collected what the Egyptian people‘s support looks like ... especially since there are rumors that there’s been a decline in popular support,” said Mohamed Shaaban, the campaign’s co-founder and an independent lawmaker allied with Sisi.

Some Sisi opponents say the scale of the campaign shows that Egyptians have few viable opposition candidates to choose from in the election likely to happen around April.

“All this negatively affects the political climate in Egypt and increases reluctance to run against Sisi,” Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, nephew of a former president who once backed Sisi but is now considering running against him, said last week.

“It will discourage voters and make them more reluctant to go out and vote in the upcoming elections.”

Detractors have taken to social media to poke fun at the petition, posting pictures of aliens and U.S. President Donald Trump signing the form. Others have suggested a counter-movement calling instead for Sisi to step down.

Under Sisi‘s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls. There have been no official polls on the upcoming election yet.

However, many Egyptians are wary of challenging the status quo after six years of living through a pro-democracy revolt, a military takeover and a prolonged state of emergency that has left people unwilling to protest or looking for stability.

Only two people -- Sadat and Khaled Ali, a lawyer who challenged Sisi over a dispute about two islands in the Red Sea -- have publicly aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win.

Last election, Sisi won about 97 percent of the vote on a turnout of 47.5 percent, after voting was extended for a day. This time, his backers want to show his legitimacy not been tarnished by economic and security problems.

“The issue is not whether Sisi will win the 2018 election; rather, it is about how much interest and buzz can be generated about the process,” said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.

“The more public interest, the better - if turnout and interest is minimal, that won’t be catastrophic for the authorities, but is certainly not the image they wish to project domestically or internationally,” he added.

SPREADING OF CAMPAIGN LIKE WILDFIRE:

The campaign was inspired by the 2013 ‘Tamaroud’, or ‘Rebellion’, petition, that Sisi used as a mandate to topple the Muslim Brotherhood, said Shaaban.

The Tamaroud movement encouraged millions of Egyptians to take to the streets demanding the overthrow of Mursi. Sisi then led the military ouster of Mursi after those protests.

Organisers says they are already seeing results. What started off with only 10 offices has mushroomed into a large-scale operation with 178 offices nationwide, said Shaaban, and close to half a million likes on the campaign’s official Facebook page.

“The numbers are changing by the moment,” said parliamentarian Karim Salem, campaign spokesman and co-founder.

Organisers say the campaign is run by volunteers and funded by private donations.

Egypt’s state news agency reported that 14,000 people had signed the petition in the Nile delta province of Al-Beheira.

Reuters could not independently confirm these numbers.

The petition form lists five reasons why Sisi should seek a second term -- cleansing the country of terrorism, completing his megaprojects, ending corruption, education, and protecting its leadership.

Even some of Sisi’s supporters who helped propel him into power, such as former campaign officials Hazim Abdelazim and Nour al-Huda Zaki, have turned against him over his handling of the economy and security. Critics point to a dispute that saw his government hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, touching a nationalistic nerve.

Egypt has fought an insurgency waged by an Islamic State affiliate in North Sinai since 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed. But the group has begun turning its guns towards the mainland in attacks this year.

Sisi has inaugurated mega infrastructure projects he promised would turn around the economy, and the IMF has praised the progress of measures it has backed that are meant to curb deficits and create long term growth.

But many Egyptians say they are frustrated with the immediate fallout of reforms. The currency devaluation a year ago has cut the Egyptian pound’s value in half -- though it has stabilised now - and inflation is just off record highs of above 30 percent.

In Shaaban’s home district in Cairo, middle-class Sayeda Zeinab, where a petition campaign banner with an image of the smiling president hangs above a main square, Essam Moahmed, a baker, expressed discontent over the economy.

“Now things are even more expensive than under the Brotherhood. But people can’t stand against Sisi,” he said.

Sisi acknowledges the tough economic situation many Egyptians face, saying sacrifices like IMF-backed austerity reforms are needed “so we can take our true place.”","Egypt election in view, Sisi supporters fire up campaign for mandate",https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-politics/egypt-election-in-view-sisi-supporters-fire-up-campaign-for-mandate-idINKBN1CV2SD?il=0

Protesters had blocked the main road in Ambo, some 130 km (80 miles) west of the capital Addis Ababa, to demonstrate against sugar shortages, before police arrived to disperse the crowd.

“They (police) then fired live rounds. We know of ... five people who died from gunshot wounds,” one of the protesters told Reuters. Another witness said he saw up to 10 wounded people taken to hospital.

The regional government’s spokesman confirmed that deaths had occurred, but did not give details.

“Demonstrations happening in Ambo have resulted in death and injuries,” Addisu Arega Kitessa said in a Facebook statement, adding that they were organized by “enemies” of the region.

The province was wracked by protests for months in 2015 and 2016.

MILANO, 26 ottobre (Reuters) - I commissari straordinari di Alitalia non hanno alcuna preclusione nei confronti dell‘operatore di private Cerberus.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”.

Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

Per quanto riguarda il processo di risanamento di Alitalia, Paleari anticipa che “il secondo semestre del 2017 si chiuderà con un ebitda in sostanziale pareggio”. E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Paleari, però, si lamenta dei “costi esterni che gravano su Alitalia”. E riserva una critica ad AdR (Atlantia: la compagnia paga “oltre 200 milioni all‘aeroporto di Fiumicino... siamo costretti a sostenere costi crescenti pur restando a parità di servizi”. Pertanto, il commissario chiede una discussione “su come arrivare ad una competizione (nei trasporti) su basi più equilibrate e paritarie”. “Quello del commissario straordinario Paleari è un discorso relativo ai costi sostenuti dalla compagnia aerea. Con Adr c‘è un costante dialogo nella ricerca delle migliori soluzioni per la soddisfazione dell‘utente e la crescita del traffico aereo italiano” precisa l‘ufficio stampa Alitalia.

Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trump’s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.

“I let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,” Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba.

The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing “fertile ground” for a genocide. Kiir’s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.

“He understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,” she said.

Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir “got what I was trying to say.” On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work.

The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief.

“We have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,” Haley told South Sudan’s Eye Radio.

PROTEST CUTS SHORT CAMP VISIT

She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.

Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established “mechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.”

Slideshow (8 Images)

He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops “will also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.”

The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine.

A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.

Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling “Salva Kiir is a killer” and “Welcome USA.”

Protesters held a large sign that read “South Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.”

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest “started to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.” Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.

The Republican-controlled House, overcoming last-minute resistance from some lawmakers in their own ranks as well as united Democratic opposition, voted 216-212 to pass a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, a measure that will make approval of an eventual tax bill easier in the Senate.

Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate last year, has asked Congress to pass the tax legislation by the end of the year. Trump, who took office in January, is still looking for a first major legislative win even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, having failed to secure a promised repeal of the Obamacare law.

The White House and Republican congressional leaders unveiled a broad outline of the tax proposal last month but detailed legislation is not due to be made public until next week.

Twenty Republicans voted against the budget measure, including several from high-tax states where many voters would be hurt by a provision of the Trump tax plan that would repeal the deduction for state and local tax payments, as well as some conservatives.

The budget plan will enable the 100-seat Senate to pass tax legislation with a simple majority rather than a 60 vote super-majority. This higher bar would be tough to reach given Democratic opposition.

Republicans hold a comfortable majority in the House but just a 52-48 margin in the Senate. Democrats have called the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would swell the federal deficit.

The White House and congressional Republicans excluded Democrats as they developed the plan, and it appears unlikely that any significant number of Democrats will get behind the proposal.

“By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the American people, real tax reform is on the way,” Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said in debate on the House floor before the vote.

The Republican tax outline calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

Eliminating the state and local tax deduction, one of a series of measures to offset lost tax revenues, would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and could remain an obstacle for some Republicans during debate on the tax measure.

During debate on the budget plan on the House floor, Republican Peter Roskam of Illinois called the state and local tax deduction a “nettlesome issue.”

“I‘m of the view that tax reform does not simply mean redistribution of tax liability from one part of the country to another, but it means tax relief for everybody,” Roskam said.

‘SILVER SPOON’

Independent analysts last month forecast that corporations and the wealthiest Americans would benefit the most and many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes under the tax outline unveiled by the Republicans.

“Right here before our eyes, in this House, the Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoon of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the middle class. That is the fact,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said during the debate.

Independent analysts said the proposal would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade.

The battle within Trump’s own party over the state and local income tax deduction offers a preview of the tough fights ahead as Republicans seek to do away with other popular tax breaks.

Another area of dispute is the possibility of scaling back a popular tax-deferred U.S. retirement savings program in order to raise revenue to pay for the sweeping tax cuts.

Trump and Brady reopened the door on Wednesday to capping annual contributions into these 401(k) plans, which for four decades have helped millions of Americans save for retirement.","U.S. House passes budget plan, paving way for tax cut legislation",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tax/u-s-house-passes-budget-plan-paving-way-for-tax-cut-legislation-idINKBN1CV1A9?il=0

The reprieve comes ahead of Europe’s MiFID II trading rules, which will overhaul how investment managers pay for research provided by banks beginning in January.

Under MiFID II, brokers will have to charge separately for research, instead of bundling the fees together with other services, such as trading.

The new rules aim to eliminate conflicts of interest by giving investors greater transparency over how much they pay banks for discrete services.

EU regulators say this should incentivize brokers to produce better quality research and allow investors to execute trades with banks that offer the best price.

Some global investment banks risk losing up to $240 million (£188 million) in business by 2020 under the new rules, according to financial consultancy Quinlan & Associates.

Many global U.S. brokers servicing European clients will need to comply with the EU rules, but are technically barred from doing so due to a quirk of U.S. federal securities law. This sparked concerns that U.S. brokers would have to overhaul their operations to continue serving European clients, or EU investors would lose access to valuable U.S. research.

On Thursday, the SEC issued three so-called ‘no action relief’ letters that will allow U.S. market participants to comply with the rules in a way that is consistent with U.S. law, the regulator said.

The letters were drawn up following discussion with the European Union and will allow the SEC more time to assess how, if at all, it can reconcile its rules with MiFID.

“Today’s no-action relief was designed...to reduce confusion and operational difficulties that might arise in the transition to MiFID II’s research provisions,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.

“These steps should preserve investor access to research in the near term, during which the Commission can assess the need for any further action.”

Because U.S. and EU firms are the biggest participants in each others’ markets, MiFID has caused a slew of cross-border compliance issues for U.S. firms and trading platforms across a range of asset classes.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it had reached a preliminary deal with the European Union to recognize each others’ derivatives rules under MiFID II.",U.S. securities regulator grants Wall Street EU research rules reprieve,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-mifid/u-s-securities-regulator-grants-wall-street-eu-research-rules-reprieve-idUKKBN1CV1SK

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

A operadora de telecomunicações, cujas margens sofreram com a concorrência da rival Iliad na França nos últimos quatro anos, concentrou investimentos em sua rede e ofereceu pacotes de telefonia fixas e móvel para atrair clientes.

A witness who lives around the corner from the factory said she heard an explosion “like a roar”.","KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Two explosions tore through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Indonesia’s capital on Thursday, killing at least 47 people and injuring dozens.

It was one of Indonesia’s worst industrial disasters and is likely to cast a new spotlight on lax afety standards in the Southeast Asian country, where rules are often ignored or weakly enforced.

Workers had no time to escape from the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub to the west of Jakarta, after the explosions that one neighbor described as a “roar” that could be heard miles away.

A video of the scene inside the warehouse, widely shared on social media, showed charred bodies sprawled about the burnt-out factory, and Reuters reporters at the scene saw grass scorched over an area about 10 meters (33 feet) from the site.

“People were burned so badly you couldn’t see their faces ... It was really bad,” said search and rescue official Deden Nurjaman, who expected the death toll to climb as more bodies were found inside the factory.

Fireworks are frequently used in Indonesia for religious and other celebrations, and are widely available.

There have been a series of major fires in Indonesia this year, including one that engulfed one of Jakarta’s main markets.

Thick, dark plumes of smoke billowed from the factory through the afternoon as an inferno took hold. As night fell, the PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses warehouse was still smouldering and there was a stench of chemicals and burning plastic.

Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono told Metro Television that 47 bodies had been discovered, 46 people were injured and 10 people were unaccounted for. He said the missing might have left with light injuries or not have been working at the time.

One of the first policemen on the scene, Raymond Masengi, told Metro TV that he and other officers had to smash holes in the factory wall to help the injured escape.

Fiza, a doctor in the emergency unit at Tangerang General Hospital, said he was treating seven people, some of them with burns to more than 80 percent of their bodies. Three were in critical condition.

A nearby mosque held prayers for the victims.

“LIKE A ROAR”

Forensic police worked in fading light to examine the debris, setting up a few floodlights to try and establish the cause of the blaze.

Yuwono said police were looking into the permit of the factory, which was close to a school and housing and - according to media reports - had been operating for only two months.

A witness who lives around the corner from the factory said she heard an explosion “like a roar”.

“I dressed and stepped outside the house, and saw the flames, they were almost in my face. The smoke, the heat was in my face. I panicked, I was scared, I picked up my son and ran away from the fire,” said Kartini, 40, who uses one name, like many Indonesians.

Hundreds of children at a school just 100 meters (yards) from the factory jumped in terror over a wall as the explosions boomed, dropping books and bags in their haste to get away.

Science teacher Asep Mahmud, 47, said: “There were several small explosions and then one really big one that shook our buildings and desks.”

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

E’ quanto scritto nella lettera inviata dal presidente del Consiglio Paolo Gentiloni al Consiglio Superiore della Banca d‘Italia, che si riunisce domani per il previsto parere prima della riunione del Consiglio dei ministri e del via libera finale del Capo dello Stato.

Visco, 67 anni, siede nel Consiglio della Banca centrale europea ed è considerato un alleato di Mario Draghi, ex governatore della Banca d‘Italia tra il 2005 e il 2011.

Il mandato di Visco scade a fine ottobre e può essere rinnovato per altri sei anni.

La conferma del governatore arriva dopo un percorso accidentato che ha visto la clamorosa presa di distanza del principale partito di maggioranza, guidato dall‘ex premier Matteo Renzi, e di buona parte dell‘opposizione in Parlamento che rimproverano alla Banca d‘Italia una cattiva gestione delle crisi bancarie.

Dieci istituti bancari hanno dovuto essere salvati negli ultimi due anni e centinaia di migliaia di risparmiatori hanno perso i loro soldi.

A prevalere è stata l‘esigenza di tutelare l‘indipendenza e la continuità nella gestione della banca centrale, riferiscono fonti vicine alla situazione.

La scelta di confermare Visco ha potuto anche contare sul supporto autorevole del presidente della Bce Mario Draghi, presente personalmente e in modo inedito alla lettura delle ultime considerazioni finali del governatore lo scorso maggio.

Già allora, il 31 maggio di quest‘anno, proprio parlando di fronte a Draghi, Visco interrompendo la lettura del testo delle Considerazioni finali, aveva respinto le critiche fatte “con toni piuttosto aspri, spesso con imprecisioni anche gravi” e preannunciando chiarimenti, “vi sarà occasione ancora per spiegare e chiarire”.

L‘Italia ha da giovedì una nuova legge elettorale e si è di fatto aperta la campagna elettorale in vista del voto nei primi mesi del prossimo anno.

Le opposizioni, Movimento 5 Stelle in testa, da tempo cavalcano la protesta di risparmiatori e correntisti vittime delle crisi bancarie e la mossa della mozione del Pd renziano è apparsa a molti commentatori anche finalizzata a non lasciare questo tema ai suoi competitor politici.

Il documento, che nella sua prima stesura chiedeva espressamente “discontinuità” e l‘identificazione della “figura più idonea a garantire nuova fiducia”, è stato poi approvato in una versione più soft il 17 ottobre con il voto favorevole del governo.

“Il nome che oggi verrà dato avrà tutto il nostro rispetto istituzionale. Nella sostanza però Bankitalia è stata per me un punto di debolezza del sistema”, ha detto Renzi stamattina in un‘intervista a Radio Capital.

Dalle quattro banche regionali, tra cui Banca Etruria, poste in risoluzione nel novembre del 2015, al Monte dei Paschi, salvato con l‘ingresso nel capitale dello Stato in luglio, alle banche venete, Popolare di Vicenza e Veneto Banca, liquidate e cedute ripulite a Intesa SP dopo un forte supporto pubblico in giugno.

I governo ha destinato oltre 23 miliardi di euro di soldi pubblici per il salvataggio di Mps e delle Venete ma ciò non ha impedito che fossero colpiti i risparmiatori e investitori che avevano creduto nelle prospettive di queste banche.

La banca centrale ha attribuito alla lunga recessione economica e a fenomeni di mala gestio l‘appesantimento dei bilanci di molte banche italiane che, a livello di settore, hanno un ammontare di crediti deteriorati e di sofferenze superiore a ogni altro Paese europeo.

L‘Italia chiuderà il 2017 con una crescita del Pil stimata all‘1,5% ma, secondo stime Confindustria, nel 2018 sarà ancora sotto i livelli pre-crisi.

Una commissione parlamentare d‘inchiesta, presieduta da Pier Ferdinando Casini, si sta occupando di verificare cosa non abbia funzionato nelle norme e nei controlli.

Visco potrebbe essere ascoltato dalla Commissione Casini a metà novembre, mentre martedì prossimo parlerà alla Giornata Mondiale del Risparmio a Roma.

The Mercedes driver is on the brink of becoming Britain’s first four-times world champion, one more than Jackie Stewart, and needs only a fifth place to do so, such is his advantage.

The 32-year-old is in the form of his life, winning five of the last six races to build up a 66-point advantage over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with three rounds remaining.

“I plan to win. I‘m not here for anything else but number one,” Hamilton told a news conference in Mexico City on Wednesday evening.

“I was just thinking about it as I was walking in here. It is true that I only need to finish fifth. But I thought, I think to myself, ‘How would I feel if I was to finish fifth and win the world championship?’ It wouldn’t feel great.”

Hamilton actually felt pretty good the last time that happened, albeit in different circumstances.

He won his first championship with McLaren in 2008 by the skin of his teeth after finishing fifth in the last race of the season in Brazil with an overtake on the last corner of the final lap.

The circumstances are very different now, with the Briton sure to lead all the way to the final race in Abu Dhabi next month even if he does not score in Mexico or Brazil.

Mexico is his second chance to wrap up the title after the mathematical possibility first arose in Texas last weekend.

Vettel finished second in that race, staving off the seemingly inevitable for one more week at least.

”I want to be on the top of the podium. You want to be up there... as a racing driver, you constantly want to show your performance and your strength and you never want that to waiver,“ Hamilton said. ”So, that’s my goal this weekend.

“It’s going to be difficult I think... a lot closer between Red Bull and Ferrari and us. But I love that. And so I‘m hoping that if I‘m able to drive like I did in the last race, last week, I think it could be a good weekend.”

“I‘m very, very proud to raise the British flag every time I‘m on the podium. And to be up there with the greats, now potentially one step ahead of the greats in the U.K... it’s beyond my dreams and beyond my family’s wildest dreams.”",Hamilton wants to seal title with a win,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CV24P-OZASP

A large part of the company’s profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades. Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400.

The company redesigned its larger F-series Super Duty pickups a year ago, and recently updated its standard F-150 trucks for model year 2018.

Ford said its North American margin rose to 8.1 percent from 5.8 percent a year earlier. Earlier this week, GM reported a third-quarter margin for North America of 8.3 percent.

Ford plans to begin testing self-driving vehicles in some cities in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett disclosed on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, but gave no details.

Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said. He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said.

Rival General Motors Co (GM.N) said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020. GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023.

Year to date, GM’s stock is up nearly 30 percent, while Ford is down almost 1 percent. In mid-morning trade, Ford was up 0.3 percent to $12.08.

Wall Street has been underwhelmed by Ford, particularly by Hackett’s caveat that most of the company’s $14 billion in planned cost savings will not show up on Ford‘s bottom line until 2019 and 2020.

When asked by reporters about the flagging stock, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford has a “really good plan” for electric vehicles and self-driving car technology.

“I think the market will reward us,” he said.

On the earnings call on Thursday, Shanks said Ford will “aggressively restructure the business as required to achieve our objectives ... We are prepared to do what we have to do.”

He did not provide details.

Apart from North America, the only other region that was profitable for Ford was Asia Pacific, where a record profit was driven by sales increases outside China. CFO Shanks said sales volumes, market share and margins were all down in China.

He said Ford’s European operations would return to profitability in the fourth quarter and for the full year.

Ford said it had lower engineering, advertising and promotion expenses than in the third quarter.

The sale of around 5 percent of Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] next year is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Prince Mohammad.

Saudi officials have said domestic and international exchanges such as New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been looked at for a partial listing of the state-run firm.

A decision on which exchange would secure the offering has still not been made, fuelling market speculation that the IPO could be delayed beyond 2018 or even shelved, amid growing concerns about the feasibility of an international listing.

“We are on track in 2018... but the listing (details) are still under discussion,” Prince Mohammad told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday in Riyadh for release on Thursday. “It will be IPO-ed in 2018.”

The crown prince declined to discuss specific details of the IPO, which could be the biggest in history and is expected to raise as much as $100 billion.

Prince Mohammad, 32, has sweeping powers over defense, energy and the economy and is expected to take the final decision about Aramco’s listing venue and the other reforms.

Investors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure announced by the crown prince, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investments aimed at helping wean Saudi Arabia off its dependency on crude oil exports.

But Prince Mohammad reiterated that Aramco’s estimated valuation would be about $2 trillion.

“I know that there has been a lot of argument around this topic but at the end of the day the right say is that of the investor. Undoubtedly the biggest IPO in the world must be accompanied by a lot of rumors,” Prince Mohammad said.

“Aramco would prove itself on the ground on the day of the IPO. Actually when I talked about the valuation, I talk about $2 trillion, it could be more than $2 trillion.”

The timing of the IPO will depend on getting legal and regulatory approval from the jurisdictions it opts to list in, industry sources have said. It could also be influenced by the oil price - currently below $60 per barrel - a price Saudi officials have identified as a good level.

Listing Aramco is important for the development of Saudi Arabia’s capital markets and diversifying the kingdom’s economy.

“The government should not be in control of the private sector. You create opportunity, you create business, you create development, you hand it to the investor and start creating something new,” Prince Mohammad said.

“The idea is not to restructure the economy as much as to seize the opportunities available that we didn’t address before.”

Asked whether the rift with Gulf OPEC producer Qatar has dented investors’ sentiment ahead of the Aramco IPO, Prince Mohammad dismissed the impact of the political impasse.

The Qatar Investment Authority, the Gulf Arab state’s acquisitive sovereign wealth fund has a major stake in the London Stock Exchange, one of the venues in the running for the Aramco IPO.

“Qatar is a very, very, very small issue,” he said.

Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the accusations.

SUPPORTING OPEC‘S “HISTORIC” PACT

OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is leading OPEC and other oil producers such as Russia to restrict oil supplies under a global oil pact to drain global inventories and boost oil prices.

“We are committed to work with all producers, OPEC and non-OPEC countries, we have a great and historic deal... We will support anything to stabilize the oil demand and supply,” Prince Mohammad said when asked whether the kingdom would support extending the agreement until the end of 2018.

“I think now the oil market swallowed the shale oil supply, now we are regaining things again.”

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters that the kingdom is determined to reduce inventories further through an OPEC-led deal to cut crude output and raised the prospect of prolonged restraint once the pact ends to prevent a build up in excess supplies.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but they are considering extending it.

Brent crude LCOc1 was trading at above $58 a barrel on Thursday. [O/R]

Reuters reported last week, citing OPEC sources, that producers were leaning towards extending the deal for nine months, although any decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Discussions among producers are continuing in the run-up to the next OPEC meeting to set oil policy on Nov. 30 in Vienna.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 4 the deal could be extended to the end of 2018, although OPEC ministers have not given specific commitments on doing so.",Exclusive: Saudi Aramco IPO on track for 2018 - Saudi crown prince,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-crownprince-exclusiv/exclusive-saudi-aramco-ipo-on-track-for-2018-saudi-crown-prince-idUSKBN1CV0YW

Shares of Twitter soared more than 16 percent to $20.04 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. The company did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

The United States, which did so much via its unnecessary invasion of Iraq and tragic handling of the post-incursion period to nurture the growth of Islamic State, will be largely missing from the scene. Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq.

Slideshow (2 Images)The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.
Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank on Thursday took a step towards weaning the euro zone off loose money on Thursday but promised years of stimulus and even left the door open to backtracking.

It said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January but also extend the buying program until the end of next September.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was recovering but still needed support.

“Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy,” he told a news conference. “Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.”

Designed nearly three years ago, the bond buys worth more than 2 trillion euros depressed borrowing costs and lifted growth but failed to raise inflation to the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent.

That forced the bank to hedge its bets with what some investors described as “dovish policy tightening”.

The ECB will now cut its bond buys in half to 30 billion euros a month from January given robust growth, it kept the option to raise or extend buys and promised to reinvest maturing funds for years to come.

It also promised banks ample liquidity and said the bond buys would not end suddenly, suggesting that another extension, even if only to gradually wind down purchases, is likely.

“This is not tapering, it’s just a down-size,” Draghi said, using the market term for beginning to exit a stimulus program.

“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly,” he added. “There is still a large amount of uncertainty.”

The cautious move may also have reflected policymakers' concern about the euro's appreciation against the dollar EUR= this year and their aim to keep the currency stable after its surge over the summer.

The euro fell nearly 0.8 percent on the day even as Draghi omitted a now customary reference about the need to monitor the currency.

“Today’s decision is the first real baby step towards a very gentle exit from the ECB’s crisis mode, but it is definitely not a big-bang u-turn,” ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

“In fact, the ... recalibration illustrates the ECB wants to start the exit as cautiously as possible, ideally without seeing the euro appreciate or bond yields increase.”

The biggest debate appeared to be about whether to keep asset buys open ended, with Draghi highlighting dissent from hawks, who wanted the ECB pave the way to the exit.

Still, Draghi said there was a large majority for an open-ended program while other issues were supported by consensus or near consensus.

Hawks such as Germany and the Netherlands have argued that growth is now above trend and more purchases do next to nothing for inflation, so keeping the program open ended is not justified. Doves on the bloc’s periphery, however, warned that a quick exit could tighten financial conditions, undoing years of work.

“The fact that the ECB made the tapering decision look as dovish as possible because of the weak inflation causes a risk of a later move in rates than in our forecast,” Nordea economist Tuuli Koivu said.

“The possible first rate hike – even if only a cosmetic in nature - that we expect to see in the first quarter of 2019 may come later,” he added.

The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.

Draghi said data pointed to unabated growth as employment rises, households continue to spend and exports are on the upswing.

Yet, underlying inflation has not yet shown any convincing signs of an upwards trend and the outlook for both inflation and growth remained conditional on continued support from the ECB.

“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration,” Draghi said.

Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.

The ECB, meanwhile is slowly running out of bonds to buy, But Draghi dismissed arguments that scarcity of available debt would constrain the program as the ECB had plenty of flexibility.

Still, economists argue that the ECB will be nearing its limits by the end of its nine month extension, particularly in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, making another extension difficult without a major redesign of parameters.

“Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,” Draghi said.

Trailing 2-0 to Spurs at the break, the Hammers produced a thrilling revival to emerge 3-2 winners and take their place in the quarter-finals.

“The mood was down at halftime but not that down as against Brighton. We did not penetrate Spurs enough, were not good in the final third and we said things about what we should do when they and ourselves have the ball,” Bilic told reporters.

“We reacted in the most brilliant way. To score three goals against them, who do not concede goals, then be brave and compact and good on the ball, we deserved it and it is a big boost for us,” the Croatian said.

Bilic shrugged off the suggestion that the players had shown they were clearly playing for their boss.

“I said I am calm and glad when we win in this way. You see the team is very alive and we are very stubborn in a positive way. This is no time and place to go large now. We have done a lot, but considering the season, we have done nothing,” he said.

Andre Ayew scored twice to bring the Hammers level before defender Angelo Ogbanna headed in the winner to give the visiting fans, whose team have just two wins in the league, cause for celebration at last.

“Goals are always key, they give the whole team energy. We did not want to concede the third and then score ourselves. We did that and had more confidence, it gave us rhythm and they got out of rhythm,” Bilic said.

Having witnessed impressive performances from players who have been out of the starting line-up, Bilic could face a tricky selection choice for Saturday’s league clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

“We wanted to put a strong team out tonight, it was an important game for us. The team, especially in these moments, is above every individual and we have to be humble.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

Der Aspirin-Hersteller steigerte seinen bereinigten Betriebsgewinn (Ebitda) im dritten Quartal zwar insgesamt um 4,1 Prozent auf 2,2 Milliarden Euro, wie Bayer am Donnerstag mitteilte. Doch im Geschäft mit nicht verschreibungspflichtigen Präparaten schrumpfte der operative Gewinn mit 16,5 Prozent überraschend stark. Schwung brachten dagegen erneut verschreibungspflichtige Kassenschlager wie der Blutgerinnungshemmer Xarelto. Analysten sprachen von durchwachsenen Ergebnissen, die Bayer-Aktie gab um bis zu 3,6 Prozent nach. Die Leverkusener wollen den Monsanto-Deal trotz EU-Bedenken weiter Anfang 2018 abschließen.

“Das Geschäft mit unseren rezeptfreien Gesundheitsprodukten entwickelte sich erwartungsgemäß schwach”, räumte Konzernchef Werner Baumann ein. Weniger Absatz und höhere Herstellungskosten ergaben demnach eine ungesunde Kombination. So brach der Umsatz beim Sonnenschutzmittel Coppertone fast 45 Prozent ein, was Bayer auf den harten Wettbewerb in den USA zurückführte. Dort greifen auch die Kunden für frei verkäufliche Arzneien nicht mehr so tief in die Tasche und wechseln zum Ärger von Bayer zur günstigeren Konkurrenz. Zugleich setzen große Drogerieketten - die in den USA auch rezeptfreie Medikamente verkaufen - die Pharmakonzerne unter Preisdruck.

Kopfschmerzen bereitet Bayer damit jene Consumer-Health-Sparte, die beim US-Rivale Pfizer inzwischen vor dem Verkauf steht. Die Veräußerung des Pfizer-Geschäfts mit Centrum-Vitaminen und Baldriparan-Schlafmitteln könnte im November starten, sagten Insider zu Reuters. Bei Bayer könnte bald der gesamte Pharma-Bereich durch den Monsanto-Deal in den Hintergrund rücken, denn zusammen mit dem Entwickler des Unkrautvernichters Glyphosat steigt der Konzern zum weltgrößten Anbieter von Saatgut und Pflanzenschutzmitteln auf.

BAYER: FORTSCHRITTE BEI GENEHMIGUNGEN VON MONSANTO-DEAL

Doch vor der größten Übernahme in der Geschichte des Traditionskonzerns gelang es Bayer in der eigenen Agrarsparte nicht, niedrigere Verkaufspreise und negative Währungseffekte durch Sparsamkeit bei Herstellung, Marketing und Vertrieb auszugleichen. Wegen eines unerwartet schwachen Pflanzenschutzgeschäfts in Brasilien hatte sich Bayer schon von seinen Umsatz- und Ergebniszielen für 2017 verabschieden müssen. Die danach neu gefassten Vorgaben wurden nun bekräftigt.

Auch der Rivale BASF hat in Brasilien zu kämpfen. Niedrigere Preise und Verkaufsmengen dort ließen den Gewinn des Ludwigshafener Konzerns in seiner gesamten Agrarsparte um 80 Prozent einbrechen. Monsanto kam dagegen zuletzt ein stärkeres Geschäft mit Mais- und Sojasaaten zu Gute.

Weil sich die Verbindlichkeiten von Monsanto verringert haben, ist der Wert der geplanten Übernahme einschließlich übernommener Schulden laut Bayer-Finanzchef Johannes Dietsch auf 63,5 Milliarden Dollar gesunken. Bisher war im Zusammenhang mit der geplanten Bayer-Übernahme immer von 66 Milliarden Dollar die Rede. Bei der Genehmigung des Mega-Zukaufs meldete Bayer nun Fortschritte. “Wir haben jetzt etwa ein Drittel der erforderlichen Freigaben erhalten”, sagte Bayer-Chef Baumann. Er sieht sich auch durch den vereinbarten Verkauf von Geschäften mit der Landwirtschaft an BASF auf Kurs. “Wir gehen mit dieser Vereinbarung aktiv auf mögliche Bedenken der Behörden im Zusammenhang mit der geplanten Übernahme von Monsanto ein.”

Der Verkauf des Anteilspakets an BASF für knapp sechs Milliarden Euro lässt bei den Leverkusenern ordentlich die Kassen klingeln - wie auch der Rückzug aus der Kunststofftochter Covestro, der 4,7 Milliarden Euro einbrachte. Der Geldregen könnte nun auch die angekündigte milliardenschwere Kapitalerhöhung zur Finanzierung des Monsanto-Deals kleiner ausfallen lassen, wie Bayer andeutete.

Vitor Constancio defended the ECB’s latest guidelines, which force banks to set aside more money for new loans turning sour. But he said upcoming rules on soured credit left over from the financial crisis - a big issue for Italy - will be “different” and “careful”.

Reuters reported last week that ECB supervisors were having to rethink their approach on the stock of soured credit, initially based on the same targets set for new non-performing loans (NPLs), due to a backlash from Italy.

“We’re looking of course very careful(ly) because it’s different to deal with new NPLs and deal with targets for the whole stock,” Constancio said at the ECB’s regular news conference.

He described the latest guidelines on new loans, which give banks seven years to provide for credit backed by collateral and two years for unsecured debt, as “reasonable” and in line with new accounting standards.

But Constancio said they would be applied with some flexibility.

“Compliance with these targets will be subject to the supervisory dialogue,” he said. “The banks... can explain that they have done the utmost to comply and could not do it.”

Announced this month, the ECB’s guidelines on new bad loans met with a fierce backlash in Italy, where the banking lobby, government, central bank and even top European parliamentarians said the new rules jeopardized economic growth and went beyond Frankfurt’s remit.

The main worry for them is that Italian banks, if asked to set aside more money, may curtail lending. Some may even need to raise capital - a task that has eluded Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two regional lenders in recent months, triggering state interventions.

Italy’s banking association ABI welcomed Constancio shedding some clarity on the new measures, the industry body’s Director General Giovanni Sabatini said in a statement.

“We now await the next steps that will give important answers regarding loans to businesses and families,” he added.

The ECB is now due to come up with a new set of guidelines by March for provisions on existing bad loans - an even thornier issue in Italy, where lenders are sitting on a quarter of the euro zone’s total pile of bad loans.

Supervisors had been working on scenarios closely reflecting the guidelines on new NPLs but were now rethinking their approach due to the outcry in Italy, the sources told Reuters.

Italian banks’ non-performing exposure, which includes unpaid loans and other types of soured credit, fell by 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to 212 billion euros in the three months to June, the ECB quarterly statistics showed this week.

Heather Lind, que estrelou o drama histórico “Turn: Washington’s Spies”, do canal a cabo AMC, acusou Bush de tê-la apalpado quando posavam para fotos juntos com sua esposa e outras pessoas durante um evento promocional da série em 2014.

A alegação veio à tona em uma postagem de Heather no Instagram com uma foto de Bush, de 93 anos, apertando a mão do também ex-presidente Barack Obama durante uma participação dos cinco ex-presidentes norte-americanos ainda vivos em um evento de arrecadação de fundos para vítimas de um furacão, ocorrido no sábado.

Na postagem, a atriz de 34 anos disse que ver a foto a lembrou de seu próprio encontro com Bush três anos atrás -- quando, de acordo com ela, “ele me agrediu sexualmente quando eu posava para uma foto semelhante”.

“Ele não apertou minha mão. Ele me tocou por trás de sua cadeira de rodas com sua esposa, Barbara Bush, ao lado”, escreveu Heather. “Ele me contou uma piada suja”. “E depois, enquanto era fotografado, me tocou de novo”.

Heather disse que a ex-primeira-dama “revirou os olhos, como dizendo ‘de novo não’”.

A publicação no Instagram, que depois foi apagada , continha a hashtag “MeToo” (“EuTambém”), disseminada pelas acusações recentes de agressão sexual e assédio sexual contra o produtor de cinema Harvey Weinstein. O executivo de Hollywood nega ter feito sexo não consensual com qualquer pessoa.

O porta-voz de Bush, Jim McGrath, emitiu um comunicado em reação ao comentário da atriz no qual tentou explicar o comportamento do ex-presidente como uma tentativa de brincar com o constrangimento social causado por sua limitação física durante sessões de fotos.

Em uma cadeira de rodas há cerca de cinco anos, “seu braço cai na altura da parte mais baixa da cintura das pessoas com as quais tira fotos”, disse McGrath.

“Para tentar deixar as pessoas à vontade, o presidente sempre conta a mesma piada -- e em algumas ocasiões deu tapinhas no traseiro de mulheres de uma maneira que pretendeu ser bem-intencionada. Algumas a viram como algo inocente, outras claramente o viram como algo impróprio”, disse McGrath.

Visco, whose mandate expires at the end of this month, is a board member of the European Central Bank and is considered a close ally of ECB President Mario Draghi, who was his predecessor at the Bank of Italy.

He has been attacked by parties of all political stripes following the collapse of 10 Italian banks over the past two years, with the most recent broadsides coming from Gentiloni’s main backer, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (PD).

However, Visco, who has blamed a prolonged economic turndown for the banking crisis, maintained the crucial backing of Gentiloni and President Sergio Mattarella, political sources told Reuters.

Renzi said earlier on Thursday that the Bank of Italy had done a poor job of banking oversight under Visco and he would prefer to see him replaced, flanking the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which has campaigned actively for Visco to go.

“The Bank of Italy has been a weak point in the system,” Renzi said in a radio interview. “If they consider it is worth the effort to reconfirm Ignazio Visco, I hope the next six years will be better. I can’t see how they could be worse.”

Gentiloni made his recommendation in a letter sent to the Bank of Italy’s ruling body, its Superior Council, three political sources told Reuters.

The proposal must now be approved by the council, which will meet on Friday, and then signed off on by Mattarella. Both are expected to give their green light.

With a national election due by May next year, the problems at Italian banks have become a focal point of the political battle.

In a surprise move that sparked an institutional tug of war with Mattarella, Renzi’s PD tabled a motion in parliament this month criticizing Visco, whose re-appointment had previously been considered almost a formality.

Renzi has since continued to criticize Visco, saying the party did not support him, while adding that Gentiloni was free to propose whom he wanted for the job.

The PD, as the ruling party, had itself been targeted by the opposition after the bank collapses wiped out the savings of thousands of people who held shares and bonds in the lenders.

Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the CFPB appointed by former President Barack Obama, who argued consumers need protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the CFPB rule would increase costs for consumers.

Their celebration could be short lived. Credit-scoring agency Equifax had to drop its arbitration clause for 145.5 million consumers affected by a data breach disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after U.S. lender Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.

Before the vote, the industry had been largely enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they need further antitrust regulations.

FILE PHOTO: Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey takes part in a panel discussion on Sharia law at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-woolsey-exclusive/exclusive-while-advising-trump-in-2016-ex-cia-chief-proposed-plan-to-discredit-turkish-cleric-idUKKBN1CV2S1

Wall Street has often overlooked the company’s relatively small profits as Chief Executive Jeff Bezos chases growth.

Bezos has looked to cement the company’s position as a leader in cloud services, become a formidable foe of Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and disrupt the retail industry with its recent purchase of premium grocer Whole Foods.

This quarter, however, investors will want to see if Amazon’s operating income is being pressured as it cuts prices to fight competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which is investing heavily in its own online business.

“The open question for the fourth quarter is whether they will have to compete on price because Wal-Mart is making such a push into online,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a preview note.

“If their guidance for operating profit is substantially below a year ago, then that’s a signal that they intend to compete on price.”

Amazon closed its $13.7 billion Whole Foods buy on Aug. 28 and immediately slashed prices of some products at the grocer.

Analysts say the price cuts and investments in other sectors, from cloud computing to video, are likely to raise the company’s costs and reduce third-quarter operating income.

Amazon has given a wide forecast range - between operating income of $300 million and an operating loss of $400 million.

Analysts on average are expecting $144.6 million, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.

The company said in July it expected third-quarter revenue of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion. Analysts expect revenue to rise 29 percent $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Amazon’s shares were up 0.6 percent in early trading on Thursday. They have dropped 7 percent since the company reported second-quarter results on July 27.

Investors acknowledge that Amazon’s ambitions to disrupt multiple industries requires constant spending, and lower margins may not be a big concern, Barclays analysts said in their preview note.

The company’s operating costs jumped 29 percent to $32.14 billion in the third quarter of 2016.

Shareholders will also be closely watching Amazon’s holiday-quarter forecast, he said, adding that the company might forecast disappointing fourth-quarter operating income.

Amazon reported operating income of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The high level of spending is not going to slow this year either, analysts said.

Video will remain an area where Amazon spends heavily as original shows help it gain and retain subscribers. Rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) commands the online-streaming market by spending billions on original shows.

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market met a new foe this summer during talks to lease a top retail space in a San Francisco mall: the Target next door.

As City Center mall’s largest tenant, Target Corp had a say over changes to the property. According to people familiar with the lease discussions, Target balked at sharing the mall with Whole Foods because it feared competition from the grocery chain’s new owner, Amazon.com Inc.

Early attempts to persuade Target failed, and Whole Foods may now have to concede certain Amazon initiatives - such as lockers where customers can pick up goods ordered online - if it wants the location, the people said. Talks are ongoing.

A Reuters examination of real estate agreements and interviews with 20 retail landlords, lawyers and brokers show that the strings attached to operating in malls like City Center present an emerging and little-scrutinized challenge to Amazon’s quest to re-shape Whole Foods.

Across the United States, large retailers including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc and Best Buy Co Inc have legal rights in many lease agreements that allow them to limit what Amazon can do with nearby Whole Foods stores, and where it can open new ones.

Documents reviewed by Reuters show bans on Amazon lockers and delivery operations near a Target store in Illinois and also in Florida, where a new Whole Foods is set to open. Lockers for retrieving online orders are a way for Amazon to spur sales through the grocery chain.

In Manhattan and other locations, the leases of Whole Foods’ big box neighbors bar it from selling a range of goods that Amazon has in its massive online inventory, from electronics to toys and linens.

Even Whole Foods stores that do not share space with major rivals can face constraints imposed by local governments. A city council resolution in White Plains, New York, restricted the hours when Whole Foods can use a loading dock prior to the grocer locating in the mall.

Amazon declined to answer questions about how these restrictions across the country impact its plans.

In a statement, Target said it is “focused on what’s best for the company and delivering on the reasons our guests love Target. Our more than 1,800 stores across the country are a strategic asset and a vital part of Target’s future.”

The company did not discuss details of the restrictions reported by Reuters, but said, “It’s inaccurate to characterize lease agreements as our corporate strategy.”

Reuters could not determine the full extent of limits on Whole Foods stores because lease deals vary from mall to mall, and many are not public. While restricting how neighbors operate is a standard practice in retail, Amazon is new to feeling the heat.

Some mall owners and real estate brokers say Whole Foods will still find landlords who are eager to have the high-profile tenant driving traffic in their malls, and see rivals trying to keep Whole Foods out as short-sighted.

But with nearly all of Whole Foods’ 473 stores subject to lease agreements and plans to add up to 85 stores, according to regulatory filings, Amazon has launched into brick-and-mortar with more constraints and entrenched enemies than in the online world it dominates.

“Many people assume this big, 800-pound gorilla is going to come and beat up all of these retailers,” said Terrison Quinn, a senior vice president at brokerage SRS Real Estate Partners. “I just don’t think that’s going to be the case.”

DOZENS OF RESTRICTIONS

Amazon wasted no time in making changes when the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal closed in August. The world’s largest online retailer cut grocery prices, started selling its Echo home speaker in stores and disclosed plans to add lockers to some locations and Whole Foods items to Prime Now, its two-hour delivery program.

Analysts expect such moves will boost online orders and revenue for Amazon. But big box rivals have a number of ways to fight back.

Retailers routinely negotiate guarantees that their landlords will not alter malls in a way that hurts sales, whether leasing to a strip club or starting construction projects without approval, real estate lawyers said.

These leases, which often last 10 to 20 years with options to renew, may even name competitors barred from opening a store.

A 16-page memo in July detailing the lease restrictions governing Miami’s Pinecrest Place mall, obtained by Reuters, offers a glimpse of the legal protections retailers are securing.

Target required an affiliate of national landlord Regency Centers Corp to bar “Any lockers, lock-boxes or other type of storage system that is used to receive or store merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

The document then specifies more than a dozen other restrictions for the mall, from leasing space to a pet shop or toy store to operating “a fulfillment center in connection with receiving, storing or distributing merchandise from a catalog or online retailer.”

Regency announced in April that Whole Foods will open in the center, meaning the store cannot have Amazon lockers or fulfill orders for Prime Now.

A May memo of lease for a Target in Evanston, Illinois, obtained by Reuters, contains similar prohibitions against lockers and online fulfillment.

In another case, Target raised similar concerns about Amazon for a prospective Whole Foods location at the Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, people familiar with the matter said.

A Reuters analysis showed that 7 percent of existing Whole Foods' U.S. stores are within a quarter mile, or roughly five-minute walk, of a Target.

OPPOSITION ABOUNDS

Target is not alone in placing limits on Amazon.

Lidl, a German grocery chain expanding in the United States, said in a deal this year it would “prohibit the operation of pickup facilities” by rivals such as “Wal-Mart and Amazon... that sell grocery items” near a planned store on Long Island in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter. The language is becoming common, the person said.

Will Harwood, a spokesman for Lidl, said, “We adhere to industry norms and standard real estate practices when securing sites.”

A Bed Bath & Beyond store in lower Manhattan bars its next-door tenant - Whole Foods - from selling linens, bathroom items, housewares and frames, its memo of lease said. The company declined to comment.

And a Best Buy store just north of Miami has the exclusive right in its shopping center to sell electronics. A lease carve-out, which states other tenants can sell gadgets on less than 250 square feet of floor space, allowed for the mall’s Whole Foods to display the Echo speaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a reporter who visited the location.

“It is pretty standard for anchor tenants of a shopping center to reserve the right in their leases to prohibit improvements to a center - including the addition of new tenants - without approval and consent,” said Jeff Shelman, spokesman for Best Buy.

Gabe Kadosh, vice president at real estate firm Colliers International, said Amazon and Whole Foods “want to have freedom to do whatever they want.

The United Autosports team owned by McLaren executive director Zak Brown announced the move on Thursday.

Alonso, a double Formula One world champion who is competing in this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix, made a big impression last May when he entered the Indianapolis 500 and led for 27 laps.

He has set his sights on becoming only the second driver, after Briton Graham Hill, to win motorsport’s Triple Crown.

That entails winning the Formula One title, or Monaco Grand Prix according to other interpretations, as well as Indianapolis and Le Mans.

Alonso, 36, has won Monaco as well as his 2004 and 2005 world titles. He recently signed a contract extension keeping him at McLaren in 2018.

“The Daytona 24 Hours is the most iconic U.S. endurance race and one of the world’s great races. Everyone knows it,” said the Spaniard.

”It’s not part of the Triple Crown but, as I have always said, my aim is to be a complete driver and this experience will help me in the preparation for any other endurance race I might take part in.

“I am excited to go back and race in America,” he added.

“After the great time I had during the month of May for the Indy 500, I am looking forward to taking part in another legendary race that will bring back all those amazing sensations that US fans gave me.”

Daytona comes before the start of Formula One’s pre-season testing when drivers are mostly working on physical preparation for the year ahead.

Le Mans, on June 16-17, does not clash with any grand prix - unlike Indianapolis which is on the same weekend as the showcase Monaco race.

Alonso will partner British teenagers Lando Norris, the McLaren development driver tipped to take a reserve role next season, and Phil Hanson.

Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice.

Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary.

“For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.”

Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters.

Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans.

The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.

General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.”

Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather.

One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state.",Alphabet looks to snowy Michigan to test self-driving cars,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-waymo/alphabet-looks-to-snowy-michigan-to-test-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1CV1SN

FILE PHOTO - People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken in Warsaw September 27, 2013. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/File Photo

Shares of Twitter, which also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months, jumped more than 11 percent to a three-month high of $19.62 in morning trading.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc and Snap Inc’s Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about future growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey told analysts on a conference call that the company was trying various ways to attract and engage users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with the 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

So financial markets were stunned this week when the government unveiled a plan to pump a larger-than-expected $32.4 billion into state-run lenders, sending Indian equity markets soaring to record highs.

A tough political calendar and an economic downturn that threatens his party’s electoral prospects had, in the end, left Modi little choice but to act.

The tipping point, according to a source close to the prime minister, came close to home: growing evidence that small and medium sized business in Gujarat, a core constituency in the state that elected Modi chief minister and propelled him on to the national stage in 2014, were being starved of credit.

“Gujarat is not a poor state, we cannot just dole some benefits: business has to be up and running in Gujarat,” the Modi aide said.

Modi was already facing criticism from some businesses for the disruption to the economy caused by the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year and the roll-out of a new national goods and services tax (GST).

Compounding the woes, business owners in his home state were telling Modi they could not get credit from banks, the aide said, a problem being felt throughout the country as state-run lenders struggle to tackle a record $145 billion in sour loans.

Gujarat will hold state elections in December.

ELECTORAL TESTS

The warnings from Gujarat crystallised the political reality facing Modi - in the months ahead 12 Indian states go to the polls, and the outcomes will set the stage for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) bid for re-election in 2019.

The series of electoral tests comes as the economy has slowed to its slackest pace of growth in three years.

While many analysts praise the Modi government’s economic reforms, they say it has been less successful in creating jobs - a key consideration in a country where millions of young people join the workforce each year - as small businesses that create the bulk of employment have been hit hard.

The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think-tank, estimates about 2 million jobs have been lost in 2017, after the cash ban and the rollout of GST.

“There is negative attitude around the onslaught of reforms that have been rolled out in the last year,” said Sunil Parekh, a strategic adviser to large industrial groups in Gujarat, adding that “resentment is very high in the state”.

“The bank recapitalisation is not stimulus for micro, medium and small enterprises, but what it does is it eases their stress and gives banks a fresh opportunity to lend to distressed firms, as they try to improve their business.”

Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik said there was no connection between the bank recapitalisation plan and any state election.

“This package is not for one state and is for the long-term benefit of the economy,” he said.

NO SILVER BULLET

The $32.4 billion capital infusion is a step Modi’s government had long been reluctant to take, despite pressure from economists and the Reserve Bank of India to act.

Modi has made prudent fiscal stewardship a key plank of his platform after the previous Congress-led government’s inability to curb spending was widely seen contributing to India’s worst economic crisis in more than two decades in 2013.

The government, according to the aide, was also reluctant to be seen as rewarding banks for reckless lending.

But the move carries risks for the government, since there is no guarantee that the injections will spur credit growth. Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks need as much as $65 billion in additional capital by March 2019 just to meet new global regulatory rules.

Yet having decided to roll the dice, a series of critical decisions now loom. Chief among them is how the injection will be structured, with the bulk expected to come in the form of so-called recapitalisation bonds sold directly to banks.

The government will also need to figure out how to account for the injection so it does not increase the country’s fiscal deficit - for example, by funding it through state-owned agencies.

Investors and commentators such as former central bank deputy governor H.R. Khan say the recapitalisation needs to be accompanied by strong banking sector reforms to ensure there is no repeat of the lax lending practices that caused the problem.

If the plan goes wrong, Modi could end up “owning” an issue the government has until now blamed on the previous Congress administration.

“The biggest risk is always implementation,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder of financial firm Kejriwal Research and Investment Services. “If this kind of infusion is not done in a timely manner, it will end up being useless.”

The election commission said the majority of polls had opened but voting would be delayed until Oct. 28 in four of Kenya’s 47 counties - all in the opposition-supporting west - due to “security challenges”. [L8N1N18DR]

The repeat election is being closely watched across East Africa, which relies on Kenya as a trade and logistics hub, and in the West, which considers Nairobi a bulwark against Islamist militancy in Somalia and civil conflict in South Sudan and Burundi.

In the western city of Kisumu, police used tear gas and fired live rounds over the heads of stone-throwing youths heeding opposition leader Raila Odinga’s call for a voter boycott. Gunfire killed one protester and wounded three, a nurse said.

In Homa Bay county next door, police said they shot dead one protester and injured another.

Riot police fired tear gas in Kibera and Mathare, two volatile Nairobi slums. Protesters set fires and threw stones in Kibera, and in Mathare a church was firebombed.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote. The Supreme Court annulled Kenyatta’s win in that poll on procedural grounds and ordered fresh elections; but Odinga pulled out of the rerun and urged a boycott because, he said, the poll would not be fair.

In the capital, polling stations saw a sprinkling of voters instead of the hours-long queues that waited in August.

With Kenyatta all but ensured a victory, eyes are on the turnout, which was nearly 80 percent in the August vote.

“We are requesting them (voters) humbly that they should turn out in large numbers,” Kenyatta, the U.S.-educated son of Kenya’s founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, said after voting. “We’re tired as a country of electioneering and I think it’s time to move forward.”

A decade after 1,200 people were killed over another disputed election, many Kenyans feared violence could spread.

As well as delayed voting, the poll is likely to trigger legal challenges to the result, stirring longer-term instability and ethnic divisions.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court was due to hear a case seeking to push back the polls. But it was unable to sit after five out of the seven judges failed to show up.

“The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing,” a statement from the European Union said. “Not hearing this case has de facto cut off the legal path for remedy.”

OPPOSITION STRONGHOLDS

In Kisumu, the scene of major ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, many schools designated as polling stations were padlocked. Young men milled about outside.

In Kisumu Central, constituency returning officer John Ngutai said no voting materials had been distributed and only three of 400 staff had turned up. One nervous official said his election work was a “suicide mission”. Reuters found no polling stations open.

Wafula Chebukati, head of the election commission, said counties where voting would be delayed included Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. But residents were skeptical.

“Today, not a single polling station opened. People have been throwing stones all day at the police. So I don’t think people will accept that elections take place. Unless Raila says ‘OK’, it won’t happen,” said social worker Christine Onyango.

Kisumu businessman Joshua Nyamori, 42, was one of the few brave enough to defy Odinga’s stay-away call, but could not cast his ballot.

“Residents fear reprisal from political gangs organized by politicians. This is wrong,” he said.

In the coastal city of Mombasa, protesters lit tyres and timber along the main highway. Reuters contacted 18 polling stations there, and the highest voter turn-out any of them had registered at midday was 27.

“We have seen you, we know you and we have marked you,” a group of opposition supporters shouted at voters outside a polling station. Four armed police were on guard at each station - double the number on duty last time.

Yvonne Mwenesi, 21, was beaten outside another polling station before police rescued her.

“I had just voted and as I walked out, a group of men who I know attacked me saying I had betrayed them by voting,” she said, her nose bleeding.

CALL FOR PRAYERS

On the eve of the vote, Odinga backed off previous calls for protests and, speaking in English, urged supporters to stay home and hold vigils instead. Some politicians who preceded him urged in the KiSwahili language that supporters should ensure the vote did not take place.

Odinga’s National Super Alliance coalition, whose supporters attacked polling staff in the run-up to the vote, could argue in court that the lack of open polling stations showed the re-run was invalid. The Supreme Court said it would annul this election too if it did not meet legal standards.

The head of the election commission said last week he could not guarantee a free and fair vote, citing political interference and threats of violence. One election commissioner quit and fled the country. Another official was tortured and murdered days before the Aug. 8 vote.

For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a Davos-like gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into Riyadh to see at first hand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the up-in-the-air status of the biggest deal in capital-markets history.

Since the so-called Future Investment Initiative came together a few months ago under the auspices of Saudi’s massive Public Investment Fund, questions about the viability of a planned $100 billion initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, have intensified. Chief among them is the difficulty of reaching the $2 trillion valuation for the group that the ruling family wants, according to news stories. Last week Reuters reported that China offered to buy 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could circumvent an IPO.

The snag with the Chinese option is that Saudi Arabia has other objectives beyond raising cash to fatten the kingdom’s finances and fund social welfare. The Aramco offering is a key step towards making Riyadh a regional, if not international, capital for capital. It is part of the crown prince’s blueprint for reducing Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil – a feat never fully achieved by a major resource economy in the modern era.

As noted in a report by State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the FII confab, which kicks off on Tuesday, “the Saudi Aramco transaction should be leveraged in a much more significant way to change the relationship between the Saudi kingdom, the stewards of the economy, its citizens and the international investment community.”

The crown prince is banking on Riyadh’s appeal as a financial hub to meet the extraordinary ambitions of his Vision 2030 plan to move away from hydrocarbons – wise given the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles – towards other industries, including financial services. Transforming the $700 billion economy and better sharing the wealth with 33 million subjects, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, is of existential importance for the Saudi monarchy.

Market authorities have taken strides to make the Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, an easier place for foreigners to buy shares and even short them. As a result, Saudi stocks are being considered for inclusion in indexes widely followed by investment professionals. The FTSE Russell is mulling whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging-market status. So is MSCI, which will decide by next June whether to include Saudi shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index. If it does, the country’s weighting, at around 2.4 percent according to State Street, could lead to inflows of around $38 billion.

But the big numbers are those associated with privatizations, with Aramco top of the list. Speaking to Reuters, Vice Minister for Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri estimated there could be $200 billion forthcoming from the sale of various assets ranging from housing and water to telecommunications and even religious-tourism services.

Beyond bringing in foreign direct investment, selling shares to the Saudi public could tighten the monarchy’s grip on the hearts, minds and wallets of its people. As State Street observes in its paper, such deals could involve a “National Privatization Fund”, which like a mutual fund could be offered to citizens at a discount, minimizing “public controversies over the sale of public assets”. In effect it might foster a sense of inclusive capitalism, neutralizing criticism of the royal family’s excesses, like the $500 million Italian yacht the crown prince acquired, according to news reports.

Other innovations could include increased transparency about the ownership of assets that are, effectively, the state’s patrimony. If Aramco incorporates good governance into its bylaws that, too, could help nurture an ownership culture among Saudis and reduce any mistrust of the ruling family. From this could follow other benefits, like the creation of a fixed-income market, albeit one compliant with sharia standards on lending and usury. That in turn would let banks off the hook for much of the risk while channeling capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, and away from state juggernauts.

The FII kicks off with a welcome from the crown prince followed by a panel that includes Aramco Chief Executive Amir Nasser. They need to sound convincing that the IPO of the biggest company ever to go public is on track. If the sale of the oil group is delayed or diverted, it would make the rest of Saudi’s Vision 2030 looks increasingly cloudy, too.",Breakingviews - Cox: Aramco clouds Saudi's coming-out party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-cox-aramco-clouds-saudis-coming-out-party-idUSKBN1CT0CP

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

Senator John Thune, a Republican, said the new policy “provides sensible direction that promotes drone safety, innovation, and local input.”",Trump administration program to test expanded drone use,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drones/trump-administration-program-to-test-expanded-drone-use-idUSKBN1CU2EA

Air Canada Flight AC781, an A320 originating in Montreal, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday after receiving proper clearance only to learn that a subsequent message from air traffic control was not received by the crew, a spokeswoman for the airline said by email.

Air traffic control at SFO had instructed the Air Canada crew multiple times to execute a go-around because the controller was not certain that a preceding arrival would be completely clear of the runway before the jet was due to land, said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.

“The Air Canada crew did not acknowledge any of the controller’s instructions,” Gregor said by email.

“Upon landing, the crew was informed the tower had attempted unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft, however, the message was not received by the crew,” Air Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur wrote in a separate email.

The FAA was already investigating a separate incident from July after an Air Canada pilot lined up to land on a taxiway at SFO where four other planes were waiting to depart.

Gregor said a supervisor tried to alert Sunday’s flight by using a red light gun to alert the plane to go around, as is standard practice when an air crew is not responding to radio instructions. Instead, the flight landed, as previously authorized, on runway 28R at 9:26 p.m. PDT (0626 GMT).

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground.

On a recent Saturday, people chanted sacred hymns as family members' bodies burned on pyres of wood. Goats and cows chewed on garlands of marigold flowers left behind from funeral rites, and beggars and sages hung around looking for alms. Nearby, tourists sought a better view of the whole thing.

Situated on the banks of the Ganga, Varanasi is one of the holiest cities for Hindus. Pilgrims and visitors come from around the world to explore its temples and culture. The constant smell of burning camphor from the rituals performed at the temples and the sound of Indian classical music drifts through the city’s streets.

Death is the big attraction. Believers say that those who are cremated in Varanasi attain ""Moksha"", or freedom from the cycle of life and death.

At the Harishchandra ghat, amidst a maze of burning pyres, 68-year-old Yamuna Devi watched a corpse arrive, wrapped in white cloth and covered with flowers. Chanting the sacred prayer ""Ram Naam Satya Hain"" (""The name of Lord Ram is the truth""), the family members took the corpse towards the river Ganga, for one last dip before cremation. Devi tended to an oven in a temple at the ghat, getting the fire ready to cremate the body.

Just when the cleansed corpse was placed on a four-foot-high pyre built with wood, Yamuna Devi arrived at the scene. She handed over a torch to the son of the deceased. As he circled the pyre and lit the wood, relatives watched in silence. Devi ordered her helpers to wait for the body to burn completely and then collect the ash and release it into the Ganges.

Yamuna Devi is a Dom. Doms are the caretakers of the cremation grounds and the main keepers of the fire that lights the pyres. “One cannot enter the gates of heaven if their bodies are cremated without the presence of a Dom,” said Devi. “But people only respect us when it’s time for death so we have made a life, living amongst the dead.”



According to Hindu mythology, the Doms were cursed by Lord Shiva when a member from their community named Kallu Dom tried to steal an earring of the goddess Parvati. To gain forgiveness, they agreed to become the keepers of the flame.

Today, about 35 families from the community live around the town's main cremation grounds or ""burning ghats"" - Manikarnika ghat and Harishchandra ghat. These ghats cover an area of about 7 square kilometres each, lining the banks of the river. The smell of dead bodies and clouds of black smoke fill the air around these cremation grounds. Their proximity to the river is because of the religious importance of the Ganga in cremation rituals. The river is considered the holiest in India. After the cremation process, Hindus release the ashes from incinerated dead bodies into the river, with the belief that the soul of the corpse will be cleansed.

""People only respect us when it's time for death so we have made a life, living amongst the dead.""

Doms belong to the lowest ranks of the “Dalits”, themselves at the bottom of the Hindu caste system. Some are employed as farmers or weavers, but many earn their livelihood through the “business of death”.



Devi took over the family business when she became a widow. “After my husband died, I was sent back to my mother’s house. But society looked down on me ... I had to find a way to sustain myself and returned to become a Dom, despite criticism from my husband’s family,” Devi said.

Today, Devi is one of the main funeral directors at the Harishchandra ghat. She spends about eight hours at the cremation grounds, seven days a week. She charges a fee of 300 rupees ($5) per body.

“A few years ago, we used to provide the firewood and other materials needed for the cremation process. But now, people buy these materials from dealers and shops near the cremation grounds, and our job is to only provide the ‘agni’ or the fire,” she said.

She added that the type of wood used to build the pyres depends on the family’s choice. “The rich prefer sandalwood while the poor are happy with any kind of wood,” she said.

Bodies are generally dressed in a white shroud and sacred ash called “Vibhuti” is applied on the forehead. Flowers are also used to adorn the body. Typically, Doms will receive 20 to 50 bodies a day. “There are days when I earn just 300 rupees ($4.5) and days when I’ve made more than 6,000 rupees ($92),” said Dom Shyam Chaudhary.

Dr K.K. Sharma, who has written a book on Varanasi and life in the cremation grounds, said business is good. “When a corpse enters the cremation grounds, you will see about five to 10 individuals surrounding the body. One tries to negotiate a good price for the firewood, while others sell ghee, incense sticks, flowers and other materials needed for cremation.”

“Once the corpse burns completely, the young children from the Dom family collect the clothes or jewels (of) the corpse and sell it in shops,” Sharma said. “Any wood and other materials which have not been used for the incineration are also sold or used in Dom households.”

In 1998, the Municipal Committee of Varanasi got the Doms to charge a standard rate of 100 rupees ($1.5) for their work. But this did not last. In most cases, Doms charge people what they seem to be able to afford.

At the Manikarnika ghat, Ram Yadav, a farmer from a nearby village, was arguing with the main funeral director. Yadav got a quote of 600 rupees ($9) to cremate his father’s body. “Jagdish Chaudhary, the Dom raja at the ghat, was able to judge my financial background with one quick look, but refused to lower his rate,” he said. Unable to afford the price, Yadav exchanged his wife’s gold bangle in return for the sacred flame.

Chaudhary disputed the notion that Doms are opportunity seekers. “Why would I exploit someone when I am treated like an outcast myself? We accept whatever people give us and cremate everybody respectfully.”

Thirty-year-old Shyam Chaudhary wanted to become a motorbike mechanic, but couldn’t become one because he was a Dom. Nobody was willing to train him and he was even denied access to education, making him accept that earning a livelihood at the cremation grounds was his only choice.

But, he did not want his children to work as Doms. “The foul smell of dead bodies is something I don’t want them to live with forever. Times have changed and they are now accepted in schools. I hope they become doctors or work for the government,” Chaudhary said.

Yamuna Devi said that even if some Dom children leave their families, Doms will continue to thrive.





""Nothing can threaten the business of the Doms, because of our importance in the Hindu faith.""



Raju Kumar, the owner of a tea stall near the ghats, said many of the Doms might be resigned to working here, but it is hard on them. “Many of them consume large amounts of alcohol, chew on gutka (a mixture of tobacco and crushed nuts) and smoke excessively to forget the kind of work they do,” he said.

Many Doms tend to develop respiratory diseases because of smoke from the pyres, according to Vijay Limaye from the Eco Friendly Living Foundation, an NGO based in Nagpur.

Limaye has been trying to introduce healthier ways of cremating bodies in Varanasi, which he said would benefit the environment and improve the health of Doms. “I have convinced Doms to use cow dung and agricultural waste to cremate bodies. Though they have agreed, the wood dealers are angry - making it tough for us to introduce such a form of cremation,” he said.

Devi plans to continue to do things her way until she dies. “This job empowers me. I am often insulted for doing this job as a woman and a widow. But people don’t realise that on a cremation ground, your gender, caste or marital status does not matter. I live with that belief and will continue serving the dead.”",Doms of Varanasi make a living among the dead,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-doms-varanasi-cremation/doms-of-varanasi-make-a-living-among-the-dead-idINKBN1CV1K8

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

“Looking back now, it’s hard to believe that almost exactly 23 years ago I made my professional debut,” Hingis said on Facebook on Thursday.

“The years that followed have been some of the most rewarding years of my life, both personally and professionally, but I believe the time has come for me to retire, which I will be doing after my last match here in Singapore.”

The retirement will be Hingis’s third in a long and illustrious career during which she claimed 25 grand slam titles since her WTA Tour debut in 1994, five in singles, seven in mixed doubles and 13 in women’s doubles.

Hingis first decided to end her career as a 22-year-old in 2003 due to persistent injuries after picking up all five of her singles crowns as a teenager, comprising three Australian Opens, as well as lone Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles from 1997-99.

The Swiss returned to the tour in 2006 and although she found more success in doubles than singles, she retired for a second time a year later after being handed a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine.

The right-hander returned to the sport for a third time in 2013 and has enjoyed another successful spell of doubles tennis in the latest comeback, winning four women’s and six mixed grand slam titles from 2015-17.

ALWAYS CONNECTED

Hingis and Chan opened their WTA Finals campaign with a 6-3 6-2 quarter-final victory over German-Czech duo Anna-Lena Gronefeld and Kveta Peschke, following which the Swiss elaborated on the decision to end her playing career.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

The sacking of Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of five opposition governors in Venezuela’s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all-powerful national legislative superbody aligned with President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling socialists.

“They held a secret, express session to remove him,” Guanipa’s spokeswoman Erika Gutierrez told Reuters of the morning meeting of Zulia’s state legislature.

Venezuela’s opposition Democratic Unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti-Maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month’s state elections.

Despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over Venezuela’s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five state compared to 18 for Maduro’s Socialist Party candidates.

Opposition leaders blamed both dirty tricks by the government, including the last-minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, and abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year.

Driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly could take office.

Four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but Guanipa said he would never “kneel before the dictatorship.”

“This is an assault on the will of the people,” he tweeted after his removal on Tuesday, denouncing a “coup” in the oil-rich state on the border with Colombia.","Venezuelan anti-Maduro governor sacked, opposition in chaos",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-opposition/venezuelan-anti-maduro-governor-sacked-opposition-in-chaos-idUKKBN1CV2SU?il=0

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Gigaba on Wednesday raised the South African Treasury’s estimate for this year’s budget deficit in the 2017/18 fiscal year to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product, which would be the highest deficit since 2009.

He also halved this year’s economic growth forecast and warned that sovereign debt levels would rise steeply in coming years.

Fitch, which already has South Africa’s foreign-currency and local-currency debt in junk territory, said on Thursday that Gigaba’s budget speech signalled a policy shift away from commitments to cut down deficits and debt.

Nas últimas semanas, o setor tem tido intensa movimentação, com as fintechs mais estabelecidas procurando se firmar, acertando aportes mais robustos de investidores ou fazendo parcerias com bancos e varejistas para ganhar escala e visilibidade, como forma se destacar num mercado que já conta mais de 300 dessas startups.

O Nubank, que se notabilizou por meio da plataforma digital de cartões de crédito sem anuidade, anunciou na véspera que passará a operar contas de pagamentos. Na semana passada, o aplicativo de finanças GuiaBolso captou 125 milhões de reais em rodada liderada pelo sueco Vostok, a maior de um fundo de capital de risco para América Latina neste ano. Dias antes, o marketplace Bom Pra Crédito fechou parceria com a CBSS, banco dos sócios Bradesco e Banco do Brasil.

Fontes do setor ouvidas pela Reuters citam pelo menos mais dois acordos de cifras similares aos do GuiaBolso que devem ser anunciados nas próximas semanas.

Segundo o chefe no Brasil da área de inovação da Accenture, Guilherme Horn, grandes investidores globais até agora vinham fazendo aportes mais pontuais em fintechs, enquanto aguardavam sinais do BC, fase vencida quando a autoridade monetária pôs a regulação em audiência pública no fim de agosto. A previsão é que as novas normas, em que o BC criará parâmetros mínimos operacionais, sejam editadas até o final do ano.

“Regulamentações costumam dar uma peneirada no mercado”, disse Horn. “Agora, quem ficar abaixo do padrão do BC vai ter que dar um jeito, ou se adapta ou é vendido. Quem está dentro vai crescer, porque vai atrair mais investidores e parceiros.”

O movimento sublinha o encurtamento dos ciclos de negócios no setor alta tecnologia em relação a setores mais tradicionais da economia, nos quais os processos de expansão e consolidação podem levar décadas.

Com um modelo de negócios relativamente barato - várias dessas startups foram criadas com um investimento inicial de poucas dezenas de milhares de reais -, usando modelos matemáticos para medir o risco de clientes potenciais e oferecer crédito e produtos financeiros. O apelo da agilidade e de juros e tarifas menores ou inexistentes rapidamente caiu nas graças do público.

O movimento também prosperou diante de uma postura mais amigável do BC, que preferiu monitorar a atividade do setor, em vez de proibir a operação de empresas não reguladas para oferecer serviços financeiros. Por fim, o modelo de parceria, na maior parte das vezes com bancos médios ou com cooperativas, exime essas startups de regras mais rígidas.

Como resultado, num espaço de três anos, o número de fintechs no Brasil foi multiplicado por seis.

MAIS CARO

Mas, de certa forma, sinais de que o mercado não conseguiria comportar tantas fintechs existem há algum tempo. Em parte porque conseguir se diferenciar num mercado que se multiplica tão rápido ficou mais desafiador, isto é, mais caro.

Como o marketing é quase todo feito pela Internet, o preço para aparecer em primeiro em páginas de busca como o Google tem subido sem parar.

Rodrigo Ubaldo, sócio-fundador da Allgoo, especializada em digitalizar instituições financeiras, calcula que o custo unitário de aquisição de clientes na Internet chega a 700 reais.

“Embora ainda seja menor do que o custo por cliente nos canais físicos, é um preço que está ficando alto demais”, disse Ubaldo.

No que parece ser um paradoxo, algumas dessas fintechs estão procurando fazer divulgação usando canais físicos, seja abordando pessoas diretamente nas ruas ou comprando espaço na mídia tradicional.

“O canal de divulgação exclusivo pela Internet está se exaurindo”, disse Rogério Cardozo, diretor executivo da Enova, dona da plataforma online de crédito Simplic. “Estamos pensando em ter stands em lugares públicos”, disse Marcelo Ciampolini, presidente-executivo da Lendico.

Outro fator que concorre para filtrar as fintechs sobreviventes é o fôlego financeiro. Em outras palavras, por quanto tempo a empresa pode operar no vermelho, investindo só no crescimento da base.

“Poderíamos atingir o break even (lucro) em dois meses se quiséssemos; era só desacelerar”, disse Cristina Junqueira, cofundadora e vice-presidente de desenvolvimento de negócios da Nubank, em agosto à Reuters. “Mas isso não faz sentido hoje.” O Nubank tem um público estimado em 2,5 milhões de portadores de cartões.

Em outra frente, a capacidade de funding da instituição financeira sócia também pode limitar a capacidade de expansão. Só em crédito esse mercado já movimenta mais de 1 bilhão de reais por ano. E é isso que tem incentivado uma aproximação entre fintechs e aqueles antes vistos como rivais, os grandes bancos.

O CBSS, de Bradesco e BB, apostou nisso quando anunciou parceria com o Bom pra Crédito, semanas atrás. “Prevemos em 2018 ter 30 por cento do crédito digital”, disse à Reuters Carlos Giovanne, presidente do CBSS, no início do mês.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

A growing number of Canadians identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past help explain the rapid growth rate, Statistics Canada said.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the 10 years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada said, in data released from the 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census, which showed indigenous people accounting for nearly 5 percent of the population overall, also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children were in foster homes, according to the census data.

The census also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the dark history of Canada’s colonization as one of “humiliation, neglect and abuse” and promised to do more.

Statistics Canada estimated that by 2036, indigenous people will comprise one-fifth of the populations of the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan - potentially giving them greater political clout.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent. That appeared to result, at least in part, from more people calling themselves Métis rather than from a mushrooming Métis birth rate, Statistics Canada figures suggest.

In 2011, Métis women’s birth rate was just 12.5 percent higher than that of non-indigenous women.

Tillerson said that the Trump administration backed the Geneva peace talks as the only way to end the more than six-year-old war and move to a political transition and elections.

He was speaking after holding talks with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, who announced that stalled peace talks between the Syrian government and still-to-be-united opposition would resume in Geneva on Nov. 28.

“The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,” Tillerson told reporters in the Swiss city at the end of a week-long trip that took him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan and India.

“It is our view and I have said this many times as well that we do not believe that there is a future for the Assad regime and Assad family. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.”

When the Trump administration came into office it took the view that it was “not a prerequisite that Assad goes” before the transitional process started, he added.

Supported by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Assad appears militarily unassailable and last month Assad ally Hezbollah declared victory in the Syrian war.

Those forces have pushed Islamic State back from large swathes of eastern Syria in recent months and over the past year have taken numerous pockets of rebel-held territory around Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.

Ceasefire deals brokered by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States in remaining rebel-held areas of western Syria have freed up manpower for Assad’s allies.

Tillerson called his discussions with de Mistura “fruitful” and said the United States will “continue our efforts to de-escalate the violence in Syria”.

He said the only reason Assad’s forces had succeeded in turning the tide in the war against Islamic State and other militants was “air support they have received from Russia”.

Tillerson said Iran, Assad’s other main ally, should not be seen as having made the difference in the defeat of Islamic State in Syria.

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

Post-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long.

Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice.

Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary.

“For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.”

Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters.

Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans.

The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.

General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.”

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

CRISE SE REPETEA Aneel irá analisar os pleitos das distribuidoras em reunião de diretoria na próxima terça-feira, segundo pauta do encontro divulgada nesta quinta-feira pela agência.
Para Leite, da Abradee, a situação lembra uma crise de fluxo de caixa enfrentada pelas distribuidoras em 2014, também devido a uma elevada geração térmica necessária naquele ano.
“É uma situação semelhante, mas em proporção menor”, apontou Leite.
Os empréstimos tomados pela CCEE em nome das distribuidoras somaram 21,75 bilhões, em operações contratadas em 2014 e 2015.","SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - As distribuidoras de eletricidade do país têm sofrido com custos maiores do que arrecadam junto aos consumidores nas contas de luz, e a situação deve permanecer mesmo após uma elevação no valor das bandeiras tarifárias que pesam sobre as faturas, disse à Reuters o presidente da associação que representa investidores do setor.

A Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel) aprovou nesta semana uma alta de quase 40 por cento nos custos da bandeira tarifária vermelha nível 2, atualmente vigente devido à falta de chuva na área dos reservatórios das hidrelétricas, principal fonte de energia do Brasil.

Criadas em 2015, as bandeiras tarifárias geram uma cobrança adicional nas contas quando a oferta de energia é baixa, para incentivar um consumo menor e ao mesmo tempo arrecadar recursos para que as distribuidoras paguem pela geração de termelétricas mais caras, que têm sido acionadas devido à situação crítica das usinas hídricas.

O presidente da Associação Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia Elétrica (Abradee), Nelson Leite, afirmou que a mudança nas bandeiras tarifárias gera uma receita adicional de cerca de 1 bilhão de reais para as distribuidoras até o final do ano, enquanto o custo estimado com a compra de energia térmica no período é de cerca de 6 bilhões de reais.

“Só isso não resolve o problema. Serão necessárias medidas adicionais”, disse Leite.

Ele afirmou que as distribuidoras já apresentaram uma proposta à Aneel para resolver o déficit de caixa com o menor impacto possível sobre os consumidores, mas ainda assim o problema poderá gerar elevações adicionais nas tarifas.

O cenário deve-se basicamente ao baixo nível dos reservatórios das usinas hídricas, que exige um uso mais intenso de termelétricas que o esperado inicialmente, com custos mais elevados e que não estavam previstos nas tarifas.

Segundo Leite, existe o risco de as distribuidoras não terem recursos para pagar a energia gerada pelas termelétricas.

As distribuidoras devem pagar as térmicas em 8 e 9 de novembro, quando a Câmara de Comercialização de Energia Elétrica (CCEE) realizará a liquidação das operações do mercado de energia referentes a setembro.

“Estamos pedindo para postergar a liquidação, do início para o final do mês, para dar mais tempo de as distribuidoras arrecadarem. Estamos sugerindo no último dia útil de novembro”, disse Leite.

As distribuidoras também querem convencer a Aneel a repassar a elas recursos de um fundo setorial, a Conta de Energia de Reserva, abastecida com recursos gerados pela venda da energia de usinas de energia renovável contratadas pelo governo nos chamados “leilões de reserva”.

Leite estimou que o fundo setorial poderia liberar cerca de 1 bilhão de reais adicionais para as distribuidoras.

Mesmo com essas medidas, segundo o dirigente da Abradee, algumas concessionárias ainda podem precisar de um reajuste extraordinário de tarifas para fechar o ano.

“Ainda não resolve a situação de algumas distribuidoras... nesse caso, estaríamos falando de uma revisão extraordinária... para que a distribuidora possa se reequilibrar e evitar uma situação de inadimplência”, afirmou o dirigente, sem citar empresas.

MERCADO TRAVADO?

Uma inadimplência de distribuidoras teria potencial de praticamente travar o mercado de energia, uma vez que a liquidação financeira de operações realizada mensalmente pela CCEE já vem apresentando elevados valores em abertos desde meados de 2015.

Em outubro, quando foram liquidadas as operações referentes a agosto, a CCEE conseguiu arrecadar apenas 2,54 bilhões de reais, de 6,82 bilhões cobrados junto aos agentes de mercado.

A maior parte dos valores não pagos, ou 3,7 bilhões de reais, está associada também à menor geração das hidrelétricas. Isso porque empresas que operam usinas hídricas conseguiram liminares na Justiça que as livram de arcar com os débitos.

O governo tem buscado um acordo para acabar com a briga judicial, e uma proposta nesse sentido deve constar de uma medida provisória em preparação no Ministério de Minas e Energia.

CRISE SE REPETE

A Aneel irá analisar os pleitos das distribuidoras em reunião de diretoria na próxima terça-feira, segundo pauta do encontro divulgada nesta quinta-feira pela agência.

Para Leite, da Abradee, a situação lembra uma crise de fluxo de caixa enfrentada pelas distribuidoras em 2014, também devido a uma elevada geração térmica necessária naquele ano.

Na época, o governo da então presidente Dilma Rousseff chegou a autorizar a CCEE a contratar empréstimos bilionários junto a bancos em nome das empresas do setor.

“É uma situação semelhante, mas em proporção menor”, apontou Leite.

Os empréstimos tomados pela CCEE em nome das distribuidoras somaram 21,75 bilhões, em operações contratadas em 2014 e 2015. O custo do pagamento desses financiamentos será repassado às tarifas até 2020.","Tarifa de energia não cobre custo mesmo com alta em bandeiras, dizem distribuidoras",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CV2PR-OBRBS

FILE PHOTO: Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey takes part in a panel discussion on Sharia law at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CV2S1

Both players knew a win would secure a passage to the semi-finals as they held identical 1-1 records in White Group play at the season-ending event but the 37-year-old was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court to progress.

Muguruza had brushed aside Williams to claim her second grand slam title in July but any hopes she had of repeating the feat were snuffed out by a resolute opponent, who simply refused to buckle in the tense Singapore Indoor Stadium encounter.

“I played an amazing opponent who has had an amazing year so I was so happy to win the last point,” Williams said in a courtside interview.

The victory enabled Williams, who won this event in 2008, to advance along with pool winner Karolina Pliskova, who won her first two matches but ended round-robin play with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko earlier on Thursday.

The winner-takes-all showdown started with Williams looking to dictate terms, pushing Muguruza around the court and attacking her second serve as the Spaniard countered by pushing the American back with her deep groundstrokes.

The 37-year-old continued to pick away at the Muguruza serve but an ace and a string of big forehand winners helped stave off the early threat as both combatants took the fight to each other in a high-class encounter.

The pair traded service breaks before Muguruza failed to hold on and send the opener into a tiebreak when Williams converted her third set point after the back-peddling Spaniard dumped a forehand into the net.

OSTAPENKO VICTORIOUS

Muguruza’s repeated attempts to pull clear in the second were denied by Williams on every occasion with the American twice battling back from behind to edge 5-4 ahead with her strongest service game of the set.

The American made a concerted push for victory in the 10th game and sealed a memorable victory after an hour and 41 minutes when Muguruza sent another feeble forehand into the net.

“It’s not easy out here, you have to play every point well or you end up losing the game. I had some great coaching going into my match and I hope I can win some more,” Williams added.

Earlier, Ostapenko ended her maiden WTA Finals campaign on a winning note with a surprisingly easy victory over a subdued Pliskova, the Latvian saving her best until last after she was eliminated earlier in the week.

World number three Pliskova won her opening two matches against Williams and Muguruza to book a semi-final berth but the Czech was out-gunned by an inspired French Open champion in 66 minutes.

Ostapenko had battled hard in her opening matches to no avail, especially in a grueling three-set loss to Williams, but she served brilliantly against Pliskova and found the corners with her booming forehand to end her season with a win.

“Yes, I lost my earlier two matches but it’s my first time here and I am just happy to finish my season here, in the top eight, especially with a win at the end,” Ostapenko said.

Both funds have a combined $10 million in assets, with a target of $100 million, Kyle Samani, Multicoin’s managing partner said in an interview with Reuters. Samani expects the firm to hit that goal in the first quarter of 2018.

Multicoin has an long-term investment view, typically three to four years, said managing partner Tushar Jain. That’s far longer than the typical horizon of digital currency funds of just a few months.

“We’ll adjust the percentage of the portfolio during that time. We only invest in assets that will hold for that time frame,” Jain added.

The firm actively manages two funds: Diversified and Concentrated. The Diversified fund holds between 20-30 tokens at any given time, while the Concentrated Fund has six to eight digital assets.

“We look for protocols that replace middlemen with network participants,” Samani said. “We’ve spent a lot of time looking at the market opportunities and at which protocols are best suited to take advantage of those opportunities.”

Samani and Jain came out of the NYU Stern School of Business and both have tech entrepreneur backgrounds.

Crypto-currency funds have mushroomed in 2017 as the market capitalization of digital tokens exploded to roughly $170 billion. The price of bitcoin alone topped nearly $6,000 eight years after it burst into the scene.

Out of bitcoin came blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions that has underpinned its technology.

There are more than 100 crypto-hedge funds that manage between $2-$3 billion, according to data Autonomous NEXT, which tracks future technology in the financial services industry. The research firm said 75 percent of the crypto funds were launched this year.

Multicoin’s Jain also pointed out that one big difference between his firm and other funds is that the company has developed new tools and security measures to invest responsibly in the token ecosystem.

The company has built proprietary technology to solve the unique challenges of token investing at venture scale, Jain said.

Multicoin also announced that David Johnston is joining its advisory board. Johnston founded the first ever crypto fund, the Dapps fund, in 2014.

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe.

Enfield Council said it had informed Barratt its proposed bid terms for the Meridian Water development project were unacceptable, adding talks with the builder had been terminated after it formally withdrew its interest.

The Council and Barratt declined to comment on what terms they had disagreed over. Barratt declined to say how much the project would have been worth to the company.

“We were simply not prepared to sign up to what we considered to be a poor deal for the residents and businesses of Enfield,” the council said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

Commercial property company Segro (SGRO.L), which was Barratt’s joint venture partner and a sub-developer on the project, said it hoped it could still deliver its section of the project, which will provide 10,000 jobs over a 20-year period.

“Segro has a strong track record of investing in Enfield ... We are disappointed that negotiations have come to an end ... but we still hope to deliver the e-commerce centre which could create up to 2,000 jobs,” the company said.

Housing experts say Britain needs to build around 250,000 properties a year just to meet pent-up demand. The shortage is particular acute in London, yet industry data on Thursday showed housebuilding activity was weak in London, with housing starts down by more than a third over the past year.

The Meridian Water project, for which Barratt had been named preferred bidder, covers a 210 acre site between Edmonton, Tottenham and Walthamstow, and also includes supporting infrastructure, a railway station and retail space.

A source close to the matter said a venture between construction company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) and Hong Kong-based Pacific Century Premium as well as Berkeley Homes (BKGH.L) were the rival bidders on the project, adding a decision on the project was expected before the end of 2017.",Barratt pulls out of $8 billion London development project,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-property-deals/barratt-pulls-out-of-8-billion-london-development-project-idUKKBN1CV2AG

Kurz said in post-election interviews that his government would be “pro-European” and intolerant of any anti-Semitism, with which the Freedom Party has been strongly associated – though now softened by its present leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, who has shifted from general xenophobia to a focus on opposing Muslim migration.

Kurz wants stronger borders and drastic reductions in immigration. He agrees with Strache that “several hundred people have made their way from Austria to fight and murder for the Islamic State … (there is) no place for radical thought and political Islam.”

Scott Lemieux: Blame the Constitution for Trump's undemocratic executive orders

Kurz’s win is remarkable for his youth and his refurbishment of a fading party, but it’s in tune with the rest of a rising anti-European Union mood in Middle Europe. That mood is likely to be strengthened in the outcome of this weekend’s elections in the Czech Republic. There the ANO (""Yes"") center-right party is the likely winner. Its leader, the billionaire industrialist and media owner Andrej Babis, 63, would be the natural choice as prime minister – assuming that legal action threatened against him doesn’t halt his rise. At a conference in Prague last month in which I participated, Babis said that “Europe is failing on security” and that, if the 17 countries using the euro (the Czechs do not) integrate further – “we will be out. We do not need further integration.” Babis knows his fellow citizens: only small minorities are enthusiastic Europeans, or wish their country to join the common currency zone.

A swing against the European Union was not what the end of communism in the region was supposed to ordain. The Czech Republic, like the other former Communist states, sloughed off the Soviet yoke in the late 1980s with an affirmation of freedom. In Czechoslovakia (as it then was), the stubborn dissident writer Vaclav Havel invoked “the power of the powerless” – and in 1989, a few years after being released from powerless detention in prison, won power as president of his country.

Havel saw the central European states as returning to their natural European home, after decades of icy post-war imprisonment in the Soviet bloc. But that home has become one of disputes and mutual disappointment, not of amity. Freedom from communism has, indeed, meant the creation of electoral democracy, of varying degrees of strength and transparency. But it’s also meant corruption in politics and business – bribery was pervasive in the Communist era, but relatively small scale compared to today - periods of high unemployment, a growing suspicion of the European Union as an alien force (though a careful retention of its subsidies) and a strong dislike of immigration, which has meant closed borders and a refusal to participate in the EU’s migrant resettlement program. In the Czech Republic, a new ferociously anti-immigrant and anti-Islam party, headed by Tomio Okamura, a citizen of half-Czech and half Korean-Japanese ancestry has leapt to fourth place in the opinion polls.

Central Europe is now deeply and popularly conservative. Austria, geographically part of it even if it escaped the Soviet embrace, is now more politically in tune with its neighborhood than it has ever been. Indeed Kurz spoke in a Financial Times interview of his wish, if and when chancellor, to be a “bridge” between the post-communist states and the EU -- while sharing many of the former’s concerns.

Building that bridge is going to be a tough job. The countries in which Havel placed so much importance as an enthusiastic addition to Europe – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – no longer find much common ground, except in agreeing to keep out immigrants. Babis says the group, known as the Visegrad Four, is no longer useful. All of its member states have become more closed and hostile to the EU, but in different ways.

Poland differs most strongly in one sense: in a generally pro- Moscow grouping, it is unremittingly hostile to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice Party, blames for the death of his brother Lech, with other members of the Polish elite, in a plane crash in Russia. Under Kaczynski’s guidance, the Polish government has sought ever-greater control over the justice system and the media, all the while attacking liberal institutions and framing the EU as an external and unwelcome influence which must be defied.

Hungary, with the authoritarian Viktor Orban at the head of a rightist government, combines strong antagonism to the EU, a close relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and a paranoia which has given rise to a clamorous campaign with anti-Semitic undertones centered on the figure of the liberal, Jewish Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who funded many of the institutions and rising politicians in post-Soviet Hungary – including Orban himself. Soros’ largest contribution, the creation of the highly regarded Central European University, is now under threat of closure.

The veteran Hungarian-Austrian journalist Paul Lendvai, author of a new, fiercely critical biography of Orban, told me that the Hungarian prime minister “is deeply cynical and very skillful. He has imposed his power everywhere. The left is split and demoralized; the only opposition he fears is from Jobbik” – a far-right anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-Romany party that is now, like the Austrian Freedom Party, softening its image to seek a possible future place in a coalition.

The Middle Europeans have, in part, done what the democratic world urged them to do: they have developed an independent politics. But increasingly, their dominant political sentiment is antithetical to, even contemptuous of, the liberal, pro-integrationist ideals of the European Union. These ideals, which Havel would have recognized, are now best expressed by President Emmanuel Macron of France. But, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, once the EU’s undisputed leading actor, begins what is billed as a long negotiation to form a governing coalition after her failure to win an outright majority in Germany’s recent election, she can no longer offer the Frenchman the support on which he counted.

The EU is now caught between a Brexit-ing Britain – with which negotiations are not going well – and an increasingly disenchanted group of Middle Europeans. The relief with which the defeat of the far-right in France and the Netherlands was greeted earlier this year was premature. A determination to close borders, to oppose more powers for Brussels and reluctance to accept its authority grows and spreads – and renders the European dream of unity, for the moment, impossible.",Commentary: Middle Europe turns its back on the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-austria-commentary/commentary-middle-europe-turns-its-back-on-the-eu-idUSKBN1CP26M

Xi’s official portrait dominated the People’s Daily’s front page report on the unveiling of the party’s new top leadership. Below that was a smaller group photograph of the new top leadership - the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Xi.

It is a stark departure from recent precedent, with Mao Zedong the last leader to be granted such status on the front page after the party conclave - which is held once every five years.

The People’s Daily did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Deng Xiaoping introduced collective leadership three decades ago to ward off the rise of another Mao-like cult of personality, the official portraits of all newly-selected Politburo Standing Committee members have been presented together on the front page in a grid.

The portrait of the party’s top leader, the general secretary, is usually only slightly more prominent; reflecting his position as the first among equals.

Xi is the party’s general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and president of the country.

In Thursday’s People’s Daily, the portraits and biographical information of the six other standing committee members - Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng - were relegated to the inside pages.

“That’s definitely the first time since Mao,” said Ryan Manuel, a China expert at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Xi’s oversized portrait on the front of the paper.

The People’s Daily is closely parsed by party cadres and others, and sets the tone for media coverage in state-run newspapers at the provincial level.

Manuel said the paper closely followed regimented rules and norms and would have done so especially meticulously for its “most important front page in five years”.

“It’s a strict system,” he said. “The rules of placement and the rules of what type of photos you put on there are incredibly tightly argued and defined.”

Xi’s status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao was underlined on Wednesday when the party, in another break with precedent, revealed a new leadership line-up without naming an obvious successor to him.

There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of the customary second five-year term in power, which ends in 2022.

During the congress, Xi became the first leader since Mao to have a political ideology bearing his name enshrined in the party’s constitution while in office.","On front page of China's flagship paper, Xi gets Mao-like prominence",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-media/on-front-page-of-chinas-flagship-paper-xi-gets-mao-like-prominence-idUSKBN1CV11X

An Apple spokesman confirmed the acquisition, which was earlier reported in New Zealand media. Both companies declined to provide details of the purchase.

Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.

Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.

Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.

Apple’s interest in PowerbyProxi may be driven by the latter’s other products, some of which can support transferring up to 150 watts through any non-metallic material, for wirelessly charging industrial machinery and medical equipment, said Jake Saunders, Asia Pacific vice president of ABI Research.

This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.

For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.

The separate assaults across the Iraqi-Syrian frontier aim to deal a final blow to the Islamic State “caliphate” that has crumbled this year in Syria and Iraq, with the group losing the cities of Mosul, Raqqa and swathes of other territory.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Islamic State fighters would have “to choose between death and surrender” as he announced the offensive on the region of Rawa and al-Qaim, which is located at the Syrian border.

The Iraqi air force dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad.

“Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag has been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim,” said the text.

Regular Iraqi army units, Sunni tribal forces and Iranian-backed paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the Syrian border, the Joint Operations Command said.

In a statement welcoming the offensive, the U.S.-led international military coalition which has run an air campaign against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq since 2014, said approximately 1,500 Islamic State fighters were estimated to be still in the immediate vicinity of al-Qaim.

In Syria, Islamic State has been driven back into a strip of territory along the Euphrates River by separate offensives waged by the Syrian government and its allies on the one hand, and by Syrian militias backed by the U.S.-led coalition on the other.

A report issued by a military news service run by Hezbollah, which is fighting in support of Damascus, said on Thursday that the army and its allies had captured the “T2” pumping station from Islamic State.

This was “a launch pad for the army and its allies to advance towards the town of Albu Kamal ... which is considered the last remaining stronghold of the Daesh organization in Syria”, it said.

Around 70 km (40 miles) from T2, Albu Kamal is located on the west bank of the Euphrates at the Iraqi border in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor, just over the frontier from al-Qaim on the Iraqi side.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the Syrian army had advanced from T2 to reach 45km from the outskirts of Albu Kamal.

Syrian government forces and their allies have made rapid gains against Islamic State in Deir al-Zor in recent weeks.

They have advanced mostly in areas to the west of the Euphrates River where they have captured the town of al-Mayadin and besieged the last Islamic State-held pockets of Deir al-Zor city.

The U.S.-led coalition is waging a separate campaign against the group in Deir al-Zor, focused on areas to the east of the Euphrates River.","Iraq, Syria converge on Islamic State's last strongholds",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CV23C

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The mainly French-speaking province last week passed the law which does not specify which face coverings are prohibited but has largely focused debate on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers and those dealing with them.

Quebec’s Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee said the province wants to ensure accurate identification and better communication and public safety.

Vallee said women would have to remove their veils when necessary for identification but not for the entirety of a transit ride or other public service. She said no-one would be denied emergency medical care, even if they refused to unveil.

“These are common-sense rules,” Vallee told reporters in Quebec City.

Vallee’s remarks come amid continuing protests against the law, including from Muslim groups and rights advocates. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government has no place dictating what women wear but stopped short of saying Ottawa would challenge the law.

Vallee said those who refused to uncover their faces for religious reasons can apply for accommodation on religious grounds, although it was not immediately clear what that would entail.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to unite her divided conservative alliance, which suffered bruising losses in a national election last month, in a pact with two other parties that is untested at federal level.

Politicians say it could take months to form the coalition, leaving Germany politically weakened as the European Union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform within the bloc.

In the first two rounds of talks, the CDU/CSU conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens defied expectations by on Tuesday finding substantial common ground on fiscal policy.

But as further talks got under way on Thursday there were signs of a rethink in process. “We only set out (fiscal) goals,” the Greens’ Juergen Trittin told Bild newspaper.

Arriving for the negotiations, Alexander Dobrindt -- negotiator for the Bavaria-based conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) -- said he was far from sure that they would be as successful on Thursday’s “heavyweight agenda”.

That includes immigration, potentially the most divisive topic after many blamed the conservatives’ election setback on the open-door refugee policy that Merkel implemented through 2015 and into 2016.

“Without limits on immigration, Jamaica will remain an island in the Caribbean but will certainly not be a coalition in Berlin,” Dobrindt said. “What happened in 2015 must never be repeated.”

The three-way coalition, which has governed at regional level, is so named because the parties’ colors match the Jamaican flag.

Germany’s demographic landscape changed overnight in 2015 after Merkel, in the face of refugee flows on a scale not seen since World War Two, opened its borders to more than a million migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa.

While some hailed the decision as a humanitarian act, many in her camp blame her for the subsequent surge in the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, which took seats from her bloc.

While Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CSU have agreed to limit migration, many experts say an absolute cap on refugee numbers would violate the German constitution.

The Greens want to maintain a more generous immigration policy, are advocates of closer European integration - opposed by the FDP - and are adamant that Germany stick to all climate targets.

“I understand it hurts if parties can’t implement promises they made in the election campaign,” said Greens co-chief Cem Ozdemir. “We have to explain to people that some of those promises were dreams and now it’s reality.”

For Wolfgang Kubicki of the FDP, a potential candidate for finance minister, closing that gap may be problematic.

Both players knew a win would secure a passage to the semi-finals as they held identical 1-1 records in White Group play at the season-ending event but the 37-year-old was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court to progress.

Muguruza had brushed aside Williams to claim her second grand slam title in July but any hopes she had of repeating the feat were snuffed out by a resolute opponent, who simply refused to buckle in the tense Singapore Indoor Stadium encounter.

“I played an amazing opponent who has had an amazing year so I was so happy to win the last point,” Williams said in a courtside interview.

The victory enabled Williams, who won this event in 2008, to advance along with pool winner Karolina Pliskova, who won her first two matches but ended round-robin play with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Jelena Ostapenko earlier on Thursday.

The winner-takes-all showdown started with Williams looking to dictate terms, pushing Muguruza around the court and attacking her second serve as the Spaniard countered by pushing the American back with her deep groundstrokes.

The 37-year-old continued to pick away at the Muguruza serve but an ace and a string of big forehand winners helped stave off the early threat as both combatants took the fight to each other in a high-class encounter.

The pair traded service breaks before Muguruza failed to hold on and send the opener into a tiebreak when Williams converted her third set point after the back-peddling Spaniard dumped a forehand into the net.

OSTAPENKO VICTORIOUS

Muguruza’s repeated attempts to pull clear in the second were denied by Williams on every occasion with the American twice battling back from behind to edge 5-4 ahead with her strongest service game of the set.

The American made a concerted push for victory in the 10th game and sealed a memorable victory after an hour and 41 minutes when Muguruza sent another feeble forehand into the net.

“It’s not easy out here, you have to play every point well or you end up losing the game. I had some great coaching going into my match and I hope I can win some more,” Williams added.

Earlier, Ostapenko ended her maiden WTA Finals campaign on a winning note with a surprisingly easy victory over a subdued Pliskova, the Latvian saving her best until last after she was eliminated earlier in the week.

World number three Pliskova won her opening two matches against Williams and Muguruza to book a semi-final berth but the Czech was out-gunned by an inspired French Open champion in 66 minutes.

Ostapenko had battled hard in her opening matches to no avail, especially in a grueling three-set loss to Williams, but she served brilliantly against Pliskova and found the corners with her booming forehand to end her season with a win.

“Yes, I lost my earlier two matches but it’s my first time here and I am just happy to finish my season here, in the top eight, especially with a win at the end,” Ostapenko said.

Britain’s biggest retail lender reported a robust pre-tax profit of close to 2 billion pounds for the three months to September and topped up its already-healthy capital ratios.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor

The bank run by Antonio Horta-Osorio did most things right in the third quarter. Revenue jumped 8 percent, helped by the first-time inclusion of the UK credit card portfolio it bought from Bank of America. Operating costs fell, despite higher inflation, and bad debt charges remain under control. And while Lloyds is still paying out about 100 million pounds a month in compensation to customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance, it did not need to top up provisions for the scandal.

As a result, Lloyds’ common equity Tier 1 capital ratio improved to 14.9 percent – up 85 basis points in three months, and well ahead of the 13 percent that the bank previously reckoned it needed.

However, the regulatory goal posts are shifting. During the third quarter, the UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority lifted the amount of extra capital that Lloyds must hold by 50 basis points to 3 percent. Meanwhile, regulators have also raised the counter-cyclical buffer for all UK lenders in an attempt to slow the surge in consumer lending. Lloyds will not know the full impact until early next year, but admits that there is “upward pressure” on its overall capital requirements.

Lloyds shareholders should not be too perturbed. Even if it pays out 4.5 pence per share in dividends - almost 50 percent more than last year – the bank will still have added 90 basis points to its capital ratio over the course of 2017 at the upper end of its own estimates. That’s more than enough to absorb any regulatory increase.

Nevertheless, the lack of clarity over its capital raises a question mark over how much Lloyds will be allowed to return to shareholders in future. Combined with Britain’s sluggish economy and the risk of a chaotic Brexit, it’s a reason for investors to doubt the value of a bank that trades at more than 1.2 times its tangible net asset value.",Breakingviews - Lloyds capital gusher suffers regulatory blockage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyds-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-lloyds-capital-gusher-suffers-regulatory-blockage-idUSKBN1CU1A4

Tillerson said that the Trump administration backed the Geneva peace talks as the only way to end the more than six-year-old war and move to a political transition and elections.

He was speaking after holding talks with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, who announced that stalled peace talks between the Syrian government and still-to-be-united opposition would resume in Geneva on Nov. 28.

“The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,” Tillerson told reporters in the Swiss city at the end of a week-long trip that took him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan and India.

“It is our view and I have said this many times as well that we do not believe that there is a future for the Assad regime and Assad family. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.”

When the Trump administration came into office it took the view that it was “not a prerequisite that Assad goes” before the transitional process started, he added.

Supported by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Assad appears militarily unassailable and last month Assad ally Hezbollah declared victory in the Syrian war.

Those forces have pushed Islamic State back from large swathes of eastern Syria in recent months and over the past year have taken numerous pockets of rebel-held territory around Aleppo, Homs and Damascus.

Ceasefire deals brokered by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States in remaining rebel-held areas of western Syria have freed up manpower for Assad’s allies.

Tillerson called his discussions with de Mistura “fruitful” and said the United States will “continue our efforts to de-escalate the violence in Syria”.

Firms such as Amazon Google and Facebook have often been accused of paying too little tax within the bloc by establishing their regional headquarters in low-tax countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland.

The executive European Commission has said it will make binding legislative proposals for a fair taxation of the digital economy by March.

In a public consultation published on Thursday, it listed new ideas on what such a blueprint might contain.

It is seeking responses on a “unitary tax” that would be levied on a share of digital companies’ global profits, divided up between the EU countries where they operate.

This option has never appeared in EU documents before.

It would be a long-term solution, as would a proposed tax using the corporate rate of the countries where the firms’ consumers are, rather than where the firms are based.

That would eliminate the incentive for multinationals to set their EU headquarters in low-tax states.

The commission also sought reactions to the idea of changing the principle of corporate establishment, so that companies could be taxed when they have a “digital” presence in a country. That was an option listed in a document published in September.

Acknowledging that these proposals would take time to be applied, “the Commission believes that a two-step approach might be needed,” the document said.

In the short term, EU states could impose a tax on revenues from “digital activities” or services, like the sale of online ads, the document said.

They could also consider a withholding tax on digital payments or a “digital transaction tax” levied on companies selling consumers’ personal data, like Google or Facebook.

The document offers respondents the possibility of proposing alternative measures.

The public consultation will run until Jan. 3. “EU citizens, businesses and organizations interested in the evolution of the digital economy are welcome to contribute,” the Commission said.

The move is set to gauge public support for an initiative that is backed by the EU’s big states but opposed by smaller, low-tax countries who fear losing revenues.

Tax reforms require the unanimous backing of all 28 EU states to be adopted, although European rules offer chances to strip countries of their veto powers in cases of market distortion, an option that has so far never been tested.",EU considers tax on digital firms' global profits,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-tax-digital/eu-considers-tax-on-digital-firms-global-profits-idUKKBN1CV2NY

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was the result of U.S. government pressure and that it was planning a response.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network and that it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

In addition to Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

RT, an English-language news channel, fired back at Twitter on Thursday, saying on its website that Twitter’s sales staff had pressured the Russian outlet in 2016 to spend big on advertising ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch.

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. Ad-supported social media firms including Twitter generally employ sales staff to drive sales.

RT also said on its website that it had never been involved in illegal activity online and “never pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.” It did not elaborate.

O lucro antes de juros, impostos, depreciação e amortização (Ebitda) ajustado somou 13,25 bilhões de reais no período, alta de 37,5 por cento ante o mesmo trimestre do ano passado, com aumento nas vendas de minério de ferro, principal produto da companhia.

“A rigorosa disciplina na alocação de capital terá impacto direto nos fluxos de caixa futuros”, acrescentou ele.

Os investimentos da Vale somaram 863 milhões de dólares no terceiro trimestre e devem fechar ano de 2017 em 4 bilhões de dólares --a previsão de setembro para o Capex era de 4,2 bilhões de dólares, versus 5,5 bilhões em 2016.

The Reserve Bank of India asked the lender to account for 63.55 billion rupees ($980.3 million) more bad loans after a risk-based supervision exercise for the last financial year to March.

The action meant a 12.2 billion-rupee addition to the bank’s bad loans in the three months to Sept.30, as Chief Executive Rana Kapoor said they had already “resolved” 81 percent of the extra bad loans RBI had asked them to account for.

Kapoor called the rise in bad loans a “temporary setback”, adding there were steps “well under way to contain this number, to reduce this number.”

The regulator had earlier asked Yes Bank’s bigger rival Axis Bank to account for extra bad loans, while second-biggest lender HDFC Bank was also asked to reclassify one loan account as non-performing after the RBI’s directions.

Soured loans in India’s banking sector hit a record $145 billion at the end of June, but 21 state-owned banks account for majority of the stressed loans.

Yes Bank’s net profit in the September quarter rose to 10.03 billion rupees ($154.72 million), slightly lower than the 10.27 billion rupees on average expected by analysts.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans jumped to 1.82 percent at end-September from 0.97 percent a quarter earlier and 0.83 percent in the year-ago period.

Loans grew almost 35 percent in the September quarter, Yes Bank said, at a much faster pace that the system loan growth of just about 7 percent.

Ahead of the results, Yes Bank shares closed 1.3 percent higher in a Mumbai market that gained 0.5 percent. The stock has risen about 43 percent so far in 2017.

We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.
Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”.","RIYADH (Reuters) - The $500 billion mega-city planned by Saudi Arabia will be floated on financial markets alongside oil giant Saudi Aramco as part of the kingdom’s drive to diversify away from oil, the crown prince told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also said Aramco’s initial public offering is on track for next year and the national oil giant could be valued at more than $2 trillion - a sum some investors have said appears unrealistically high.

His surprise announcement about the listing of NEOM, a 26,500-square km (10,230-square mile) zone that will extend into Jordan and Egypt, is the latest and most extraordinary in a slate of privatization programs led by the floating of Aramco.

The futuristic high tech hub looks set to become a flagship of reforms championed by Prince Mohammed to create jobs, encourage entrepreneurs and permit new freedoms among Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and dependence on the state.

“The first capitalist city in the world ... this is the unique thing that will be revolutionary,” said Prince Mohammed, heir to the throne of the largest Arab economy, an absolute monarchy.

“Without a doubt, at the end of the day NEOM will be floated in the markets. The first zone floated in the public markets. It’s as if you float the city of New York.”

The 32-year-old spoke on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference, which has attracted nearly 4,000 delegates from around the world to Riyadh this week.

On Aramco’s IPO, he said: “We are on track in 2018... but the listing (details) are still under discussion ... It will be IPO-ed in 2018.”

Switching between English and Arabic, sometimes in the same sentence, the prince seemed most excited discussing his plans for the new city.

FOCUS ON GROWTH

Adjacent to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the Suez Canal, the zone will serve as a gateway to the proposed King Salman Bridge, which will link Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

NEOM will be fully owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) until its listing, and will attract investments from companies in renewable energy, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, the PIF has said.

“It won’t be listed in the markets until the idea is mature enough,” Prince Mohammed said. “It might be after 2030, it might be before, but the idea and the strategy is to float it eventually.”

The new city will not follow the rules and regulations enforced in the rest of Saudi Arabia, which imposes sharia law based on a strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam.

It will offer residents a more liberal lifestyle, allowing musical concerts and entertainment in a remote corner of the desert kingdom. Saudi Arabia has already started to relax some long-standing rules, including what was an effective ban on women driving.

Prince Mohammed said the city could appoint a board of directors and government (chief executive) whose only responsibility will be to stimulate economic activity.

“In New York, the governor is appointed to meet certain needs, including growth, but in NEOM the governor (CEO) doesn’t have to deal with any of those problems. He only has growth in mind.”

He said the name mixed “neo”, meaning new, with M, the first letter of the Arabic word for future.

The new city is part of the crown prince’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, and provide jobs for an overwhelmingly young population in the face of a global oil price decline since 2014.

Prince Mohammed has portrayed the reforms as a matter of economic survival, but one challenge for the ruling Al Saud family has been to secure the acquiescence of traditionalist clerics upon whose support the family relies for legitimacy.

Some clergy suspect the bold initiatives conceived by the prince in leisure and tourism presage sweeping reforms in education, a bastion of conservatism where clerical control is believed by Western critics to have encouraged Islamist radicals not just in Saudi Arabia but across the Muslim and Arab worlds.

But the prince has pushed ahead, confident he has the backing of most young Saudis, who make up the bulk of the population.

“I do think there is a desire within significant parts of Saudi society to move away from rigid, old-school Wahhabi control of social behavior and the public sphere,” said Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics.“So I don’t think the Crown Prince’s statements are just for show. He genuinely wants to harness these sentiments and has undertaken very significant steps, including allowing women to drive and severely curtailing the powers of the religious police.”

Economic growth has slowed and the economy may shrink this year as the government introduces austerity measures.

“The idea is not to restructure the economy as much as to seize the opportunities available that we didn’t address before. We have high capacity and we use only a little,” Prince Mohammed said.

He became next in line for the throne in June after the king, his father, removed a more senior prince from the succession. He has pledged to transform Saudi Arabia economically and socially.

“Vision 2030 is about a lot of big opportunities, so Aramco is one of them, NEOM another opportunity ... We have a lot of huge projects we will announce in the next few years.”

He said the PIF would generate higher returns than other big investment funds. The kingdom had made a 20 percent profit in five months with the SoftBank Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund. “That’s why we established a $50-billion-fund in Blackstone, which is expected to make a 14 pct profit.”

QATAR AND YEMEN

Prince Mohammed also said Saudi Arabia’s dispute with neighboring Qatar had not affected investment.

“Qatar is a very, very, very small issue,” he said.

Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist “terrorists”. Qatar denies the allegations.

Prince Mohammed said the kingdom’s war in Yemen would continue in order to prevent the armed Houthi movement from turning into another “Hezbollah” on Saudi Arabia’s southern border.

“We’re pursuing until we can be sure that nothing will happen there like Hezbollah again, because Yemen is more dangerous than Lebanon,” he said.

Hezbollah, armed and backed by Iran, has become a formidable force in Lebanon and Syria. The Houthis also reportedly receive arms and training from Iran, Riyadh’s arch-rival.

Yemen’s location is crucial, said Prince Mohammed. “It’s next to Bab al-Mandab so if something happens there, that means 10 percent of world trade stops,” he added, referring to the strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.

Xi’s official portrait dominated the People’s Daily’s front page report on the unveiling of the party’s new top leadership. Below that was a smaller group photograph of the new top leadership - the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Xi.

It is a stark departure from recent precedent, with Mao Zedong the last leader to be granted such status on the front page after the party conclave - which is held once every five years.

The People’s Daily did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Deng Xiaoping introduced collective leadership three decades ago to ward off the rise of another Mao-like cult of personality, the official portraits of all newly-selected Politburo Standing Committee members have been presented together on the front page in a grid.

The portrait of the party’s top leader, the general secretary, is usually only slightly more prominent; reflecting his position as the first among equals.

Xi is the party’s general secretary, chairman of the Central Military Commission, and president of the country.

In Thursday’s People’s Daily, the portraits and biographical information of the six other standing committee members - Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng - were relegated to the inside pages.

“That’s definitely the first time since Mao,” said Ryan Manuel, a China expert at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Xi’s oversized portrait on the front of the paper.

The People’s Daily is closely parsed by party cadres and others, and sets the tone for media coverage in state-run newspapers at the provincial level.

Manuel said the paper closely followed regimented rules and norms and would have done so especially meticulously for its “most important front page in five years”.

“It’s a strict system,” he said. “The rules of placement and the rules of what type of photos you put on there are incredibly tightly argued and defined.”

Xi’s status as China’s most powerful leader since Mao was underlined on Wednesday when the party, in another break with precedent, revealed a new leadership line-up without naming an obvious successor to him.

There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of the customary second five-year term in power, which ends in 2022.

During the congress, Xi became the first leader since Mao to have a political ideology bearing his name enshrined in the party’s constitution while in office.","On front page of China's flagship paper, Xi gets Mao-like prominence",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CV11T

The Republican-controlled House, overcoming last-minute resistance from some lawmakers in their own ranks as well as united Democratic opposition, voted 216-212 to pass a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year, a measure that will make approval of an eventual tax bill easier in the Senate.

Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate last year, has asked Congress to pass the tax legislation by the end of the year. Trump, who took office in January, is still looking for a first major legislative win even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, having failed to secure a promised repeal of the Obamacare law.

The White House and Republican congressional leaders unveiled a broad outline of the tax proposal last month but detailed legislation is not due to be made public until next week.

Twenty Republicans voted against the budget measure, including several from high-tax states where many voters would be hurt by a provision of the Trump tax plan that would repeal the deduction for state and local tax payments, as well as some conservatives.

The budget plan will enable the 100-seat Senate to pass tax legislation with a simple majority rather than a 60 vote super-majority. This higher bar would be tough to reach given Democratic opposition.

Republicans hold a comfortable majority in the House but just a 52-48 margin in the Senate. Democrats have called the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would swell the federal deficit.

The White House and congressional Republicans excluded Democrats as they developed the plan, and it appears unlikely that any significant number of Democrats will get behind the proposal.

“By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the American people, real tax reform is on the way,” Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said in debate on the House floor before the vote.

The Republican tax outline calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

Eliminating the state and local tax deduction, one of a series of measures to offset lost tax revenues, would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and could remain an obstacle for some Republicans during debate on the tax measure.

During debate on the budget plan on the House floor, Republican Peter Roskam of Illinois called the state and local tax deduction a “nettlesome issue.”

“I‘m of the view that tax reform does not simply mean redistribution of tax liability from one part of the country to another, but it means tax relief for everybody,” Roskam said.

‘SILVER SPOON’

Independent analysts last month forecast that corporations and the wealthiest Americans would benefit the most and many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes under the tax outline unveiled by the Republicans.

“Right here before our eyes, in this House, the Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoon of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the middle class. That is the fact,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said during the debate.

Independent analysts said the proposal would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade.

The battle within Trump’s own party over the state and local income tax deduction offers a preview of the tough fights ahead as Republicans seek to do away with other popular tax breaks.

Another area of dispute is the possibility of scaling back a popular tax-deferred U.S. retirement savings program in order to raise revenue to pay for the sweeping tax cuts.

Trump and Brady reopened the door on Wednesday to capping annual contributions into these 401(k) plans, which for four decades have helped millions of Americans save for retirement.","U.S. House passes budget plan, paving way for tax cut legislation",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/u-s-house-passes-budget-plan-paving-way-for-tax-cut-legislation-idUSKBN1CV19J

Voici les parcours des trois candidats qui participeront au scrutin qui se tiendra les 10 et 17 décembre prochain.

LAURENT WAUQUIEZ, 42 ans, le favori

Sa déclaration de candidature, le 31 août, a mis fin à un faux suspense tant ce quadragénaire à l‘ambition sans fard et à l‘éternelle parka rouge laisse paraître depuis longtemps sa volonté de prendre un jour le contrôle du parti.

Pour y parvenir, Laurent Wauquiez a opéré une spectaculaire mue idéologique, lui qui a fait ses débuts dans le giron du député de centre-droit Jacques Barrot avant de s‘imposer comme l‘un des porte-parole les plus en vue de l‘aile droitière de l‘UMP, puis des Républicains.

Son discours sur le “cancer de l‘assistanat”, son opposition au mariage pour tous ou sa célébration des “racines chrétiennes” de l‘Europe lui ont permis de gagner les faveurs du noyau dur des militants et de certaines figures de la “Sarkozie”, comme Brice Hortefeux.

Sa détermination a par ailleurs eu raison des velléités de Valérie Pécresse et Xavier Bertrand, les deux seuls à pouvoir lui opposer un poids politique équivalent, qui ont justifié leur décision par la crainte d‘une nouvelle “guerre des chefs”.

La voie s‘est donc dégagée devant ce surdiplômé, d‘autant que la primaire de 2016 puis la séquence électorale désastreuse du printemps ont décimé les générations précédentes.

Mais le personnage façonné par Laurent Wauquiez lui vaut aussi de solides inimitiés, surtout parmi les élus modérés qui le soupçonnent de vouloir courtiser l‘extrême droite.

Valérie Pécresse, Xavier Bertrand et certains “juppéistes”, dont le maire de Bordeaux lui-même, ont mis en garde le candidat contre un glissement trop à droite du parti, qui pourrait entraîner une scission de LR.

A ses détracteurs, l‘ex-benjamin de l‘Assemblée nationale répond en proclamant sa volonté de fédérer toutes les composantes de la droite, jusqu‘au “juppéisme” représenté dans son équipe de campagne par Virginie Calmels.

Il met aussi en avant le nombre de ses soutiens : selon lui, plus de 135 parlementaires et plus de 20.500 adhérents lui ont apporté leur parrainage, bien au-delà du nombre requis pour concourir.

“On peut rassembler”, a-t-il encore dit mercredi, mais “sans se renier”.

MAËL DE CALAN, 37 ans, le jeune juppéiste

Le conseiller départemental du Finistère s‘est présenté avec une double ambition : incarner une nouvelle génération à droite et faire vivre au sein de LR une ligne moins droitière, plus “sérieuse” et plus “crédible” que celle de Laurent Wauquiez.

“Si on a envie de porter cette ligne à cette élection, c‘est parce qu‘on pense qu‘il est encore possible de trouver une forme de synthèse”, a dit à Reuters l‘élu breton, l‘un des héritiers politiques d‘Alain Juppé.

Le maire de Bordeaux ne lui a pas apporté sa bénédiction officielle, par souci de rester à l‘écart de la campagne.

Battu aux législatives de juin par une candidate de La République en marche (LREM), Maël de Calan appartient à la jeune garde de LR freinée dans son ascension par l‘émergence du phénomène Emmanuel Macron.

FLORENCE PORTELLI, 39 ans, l‘ex-filloniste

La conseillère régionale d‘Ile-de-France, qui fut porte-parole de François Fillon pendant la présidentielle et cite Philippe Séguin comme source d‘inspiration, se présente pour, dit-elle, “que la droite recouvre sa fierté”.

Dans sa déclaration de candidature, au Figaro, la maire de Taverny (Val-d‘Oise) a plaidé pour “une refondation, un fonctionnement démocratisé, un changement radical de statuts et la clarification de la ligne idéologique du parti”.

In July, members of a White House commission on the drug crisis had recommended that Trump declare a national emergency.

Trump’s planned announcement comes in response to an epidemic that has worsened in recent years and especially wreaked havoc in rural areas. But the move stops short of declaring a national emergency, which would have freed up additional federal funds to combat the epidemic.

Officials said the declaration would help fight abuse of prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl by expanding access to treatment, and curb delays in staffing the Department of Health and Human Services to help states grapple with the crisis.

“The declaration ... will really reorient all of the federal government and the executive branch’s resources towards focusing on providing relief for this urgent need,” one official told reporters on a conference call ahead of a speech by Trump on the issue at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).

The United States is battling a surge in opioid-related deaths, including 33,000 in 2015, more than any year on record, according to federal data.

Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses. About 100 Americans die each day from related overdoses, Centers for Disease Control data shows.

The reach of the crisis has pressured Trump to act, but Thursday’s move may still frustrate public health officials and others who had urged a quicker and more forceful response.

“We must instill a heightened sense of urgency in the White House,” Democratic U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday ahead of the announcement.

In July, members of a White House commission on the drug crisis had recommended that Trump declare a national emergency. One month later, the president said he would make an announcement on the opioid crisis, but later said more time was needed to coordinate the response.

That effort was further complicated earlier this month when Trump’s choice for White House adviser on drug policy, former congressman Tom Marino, withdrew from consideration.

On Wednesday, the president told Fox Business Network he would be declaring the crisis a national emergency, which would have opened up additional federal funds.

But officials told reporters on the conference call Thursday that those funds under the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been nearly exhausted after recent storms struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.

The administration would have to work with Congress to help provide additional funding to address drug abuse, they added.

Thursday’s declaration also allows the Department of Labor to issue grants to help dislocated workers affected by the crisis. HIV/AIDS health funding would also be prioritized for those who need substance abuse treatment, officials said.

Rather than hang their collective heads after the defeat on Wednesday the Dodgers did not appear shaken in the least but rather eager to head to Houston where the next three games of the best-of-seven series will be played starting on Friday.

“All year long we’ve done a nice job of recovering, turning the page, whether it’s a big win or tough loss. It’s a tough loss. Just refocusing on the day at hand,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.

“And our guys play to the end. It was actually a very hard-fought game. Those are tough. Those are tough. Obviously on this stage it makes it a little tougher, but I have no doubt we’ll come refocused.”

The Dodgers were three outs away from putting the Astros in a daunting Fall Classic deficit but their vaunted bullpen failed to protect a one-run ninth-inning lead.

Dominant Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen entered the game in the eighth inning where he allowed his inherited runner to score before surrendering a game-tying blast to Marwin Gonzalez in the ninth that stunned the home crowd.

It was only Jansen’s second blown save of the year and first in the post-season.

“I‘m going to get my shot at them. When I get my shot, I‘m going to help my team win,” said Jansen. “I’ll be back for Game Three. The team will give me a shot again, my guys will pick me up again.”

11TH INNING

Houston then led off the 10th with a pair of homers only to see the Dodgers respond in the bottom half of the inning and push the game to the 11th inning, where George Springer’s two-run blast proved the difference in a 7-6 Astros win.

“We don’t see why we have to put our heads down or anything. We fought until the end,” said Enrique Hernandez, who tied the game in the bottom of the 10th with an RBI single four batters after Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a solo homer.

”Nobody was expecting us to come from behind after we fell down two runs. We tied the game. The next inning, we almost did it again. That’s what this team is all about.

After cruising through a season in which they posted Major League Baseball’s best record, the Dodgers have not faced a while lot of adversity.

To reach the World Series they swept Arizona in the National League Division Series and raced out to a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series where they eliminated the Chicago Cubs in five games.

“Yeah, if you look at the season, we sort of gave ourselves some breathing room out of the gate, and throughout the post-season won games early,” Roberts said.

“But I still think that the preparation, the focus on each day to win each day, I think that will be there. Whether we’re up 2-0 or tied 1-1 going into Houston, I don’t think that’s going to change our mindset.”",Resilient Dodgers moving on from Game Two loss,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CV2EG-OCASP

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The Mercedes driver is on the brink of becoming Britain’s first four-times world champion, one more than Jackie Stewart, and needs only a fifth place to do so, such is his advantage.

The 32-year-old is in the form of his life, winning five of the last six races to build up a 66-point advantage over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel with three rounds remaining.

“I plan to win. I‘m not here for anything else but number one,” Hamilton told a news conference in Mexico City on Wednesday evening.

“I was just thinking about it as I was walking in here. It is true that I only need to finish fifth. But I thought, I think to myself, ‘How would I feel if I was to finish fifth and win the world championship?’ It wouldn’t feel great.”

Hamilton actually felt pretty good the last time that happened, albeit in different circumstances.

He won his first championship with McLaren in 2008 by the skin of his teeth after finishing fifth in the last race of the season in Brazil with an overtake on the last corner of the final lap.

The circumstances are very different now, with the Briton sure to lead all the way to the final race in Abu Dhabi next month even if he does not score in Mexico or Brazil.

Mexico is his second chance to wrap up the title after the mathematical possibility first arose in Texas last weekend.

Vettel finished second in that race, staving off the seemingly inevitable for one more week at least.

”I want to be on the top of the podium. You want to be up there... as a racing driver, you constantly want to show your performance and your strength and you never want that to waiver,“ Hamilton said. ”So, that’s my goal this weekend.

“It’s going to be difficult I think... a lot closer between Red Bull and Ferrari and us. But I love that. And so I‘m hoping that if I‘m able to drive like I did in the last race, last week, I think it could be a good weekend.”

“I‘m very, very proud to raise the British flag every time I‘m on the podium.

Shaw said its wireless business - which it acquired in early 2016 - added 29,089 net postpaid customers in the period and almost 12,000 more who prepay for service.

The company said it expects to notch a 5 percent increase in consolidated operating income before costs in 2018, mostly coming in the second half of next year.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said margin pressure and the forecast for delayed earnings growth would likely weigh on the stock, which was down around 0.7 percent in morning trade.

Calgary-based Shaw is locked in a fierce battle for internet, television and telephone customers in the west of the country with Vancouver-based rival Telus Corp (T.TO).

Chief Executive Brad Shaw told analysts on a conference call that the company has reached a deal with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to offer the iPhone for the first time.

The company is spending heavily to upgrade the wireless business and has launched a renewed television product based on Comcast’s (CMCSA.O) X1 video platform it hopes will help it win back market share lost to Telus’ Optik TV.

The product, known as BlueSky, helped Shaw capture and retain more subscribers for its television and internet products, which often get sold in bundles, although marketing costs weighed.

The company said its consumer unit added just over 22,000 internet subscribers in the period, and more than 7,500 cable subscribers. It lost more than 3,000 satellite TV consumers and 4,535 consumer landline telephone accounts.

Its operating margin fell, however, to 38.5 percent, from 42.4 percent a year earlier.

Net income rose to C$481 million, or 96 Canadian cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31, from C$154 million, or 31 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.

The latest quarter included a C$330 million gain on the sale of its data center subsidiary ViaWest. The company used some of the proceeds to buy wireless spectrum to improve data speeds in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton..

Revenue rose to C$1.24 billion from C$1.21 billion.

But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 16 percent to $20.04 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. The company did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had risen 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 30.4 percent gain in the S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT.","Twitter says it could turn first-ever profit, shares surge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results/twitter-says-it-could-turn-first-ever-profit-shares-surge-idUSKBN1CV1JP?il=0

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Scientists said on Thursday an analysis of fossilized feathers on the dinosaur called Sinosauropteryx revealed a camouflage pattern that included the bandit mask, a light-colored underbelly, dark-colored back and a striped tail.

Its color pattern also hinted at the environment Sinosauropteryx inhabited: an open savannah rather than a forest, the researchers believe.

“This was quite a surprising discovery,” paleontologist Fiann Smithwick of the University of Bristol in Britain said of the bandit mask.

That feature may have given Sinosauropteryx certain advantages. In birds, the evolutionary descendants of dinosaurs, a bandit mask pattern often obscures the eyes. Predators and prey look for eyes as a giveaway of an animal’s presence, Smithwick said.

“The color patterns we found are all known to be associated with camouflage in modern animals, and so it is likely that Sinosauropteryx was under strong predation pressure as well as needing to hide from its own prey. It was likely both the hunter and the hunted,” Smithwick added.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip

Sinosauropteryx measured about 3.5 feet (1 meter) long, was two-legged with short arms, large thumbs and a very long tail, and was covered in filament-like feathers. Previous research indicated its dark feathers were brownish-red. It possessed small, sharp teeth, and ate small vertebrates like lizards.

“It would have looked like a skinny version of a raccoon mixed with a turkey,” said University of Bristol molecular paleobiologist Jakob Vinther.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip

Scientists’ ability in recent years to identify color patterns in fossilized dinosaur skin and feathers has boosted the understanding of these bygone creatures.

The camouflage pattern seen on the side of Sinosauropteryx’s body is called countershading, which helps animals blend in with the background.

Animals inhabiting open environments like savannahs often have a countershading pattern like that of Sinosauropteryx that transitions dramatically from dark to light high on the side of the body, the researchers said. Forest animals typically have countershading that changes from dark to light much lower and more gradually on the side of the body.

“We know that at least two other dinosaurs had countershading, neither of which were feathered, so it seems that it was a common color pattern,” Smithwick said.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

There are also clear nods to the issues that were central to last year's Brexit vote. Immigrants should pay more to use the UK's National Health Service, the Tories say. They're also promsing to impose fees on busineses who employ workers from outside the European Union. But it's planned benefit cuts that may make most headlines: Particularly moves to limit financial support for the elderly. Some of the expected measures, including cuts to pensioners' winter fuel payments, are a risk for May with older voters.

Puigdemont had been expected to announce an election in order to counter Madrid’s moves to take direct control of autonomous Catalonia.

But, speaking in the courtyard of the regional government headquarters in Barcelona, Puigdemont said he had not received sufficient guarantees from the central government that holding an election would prevent the imposition of direct rule.

“I was ready to call an election if guarantees were given. There is no guarantee that justifies calling an election today,” Puigdemont said.

He said it was now up to the Catalan parliament to move forward with a mandate to split from Spain following an independence referendum that took place on Oct. 1 -- an event Madrid had declared illegal and tried to stop.

Puigdemont’s stand sets the stage for the Spanish Senate to approve the take-over of Catalonia’s institutions and police, and give the government the power to remove the Catalan president.

But it could also lead to confrontation in the streets as some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, speaking in a televised Senate committee, said: “The independence leaders have shown their true face, they have promised a dream but are performing tricks.”

The aim of Article 155 -- the constitutional device allowing direct rule -- was to permit any election to take place in a normal and neutral situation, she said.

The political crisis, the gravest since Spain’s return to democracy four decades ago, has divided Catalonia itself and caused deep resentment in other parts of the country.

It has also prompted a flight of business from the wealthy region and worried other European leaders who see it as fanning separatist sentiment elsewhere on the continent.

It was not yet clear whether Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would immediately enforce direct rule or simply seek the Senate’s authorization to do so on Friday but without making it effective on the ground.

Exactly how the central government would enforce in practical terms, and how Catalan civil servants and regional police would react, is also uncertain.

Vitor Constancio defended the ECB’s latest guidelines, which force banks to set aside more money for new loans turning sour. But he said upcoming rules on soured credit left over from the financial crisis - a big issue for Italy - will be “different” and “careful”.

Reuters reported last week that ECB supervisors were having to rethink their approach on the stock of soured credit, initially based on the same targets set for new non-performing loans (NPLs), due to a backlash from Italy.

“We’re looking of course very careful(ly) because it’s different to deal with new NPLs and deal with targets for the whole stock,” Constancio said at the ECB’s regular news conference.

He described the latest guidelines on new loans, which give banks seven years to provide for credit backed by collateral and two years for unsecured debt, as “reasonable” and in line with new accounting standards.

But Constancio said they would be applied with some flexibility.

“Compliance with these targets will be subject to the supervisory dialogue,” he said. “The banks... can explain that they have done the utmost to comply and could not do it.”

Announced this month, the ECB’s guidelines on new bad loans met with a fierce backlash in Italy, where the banking lobby, government, central bank and even top European parliamentarians said the new rules jeopardized economic growth and went beyond Frankfurt’s remit.

The main worry for them is that Italian banks, if asked to set aside more money, may curtail lending. Some may even need to raise capital - a task that has eluded Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two regional lenders in recent months, triggering state interventions.

Italy’s banking association ABI welcomed Constancio shedding some clarity on the new measures, the industry body’s Director General Giovanni Sabatini said in a statement.

“We now await the next steps that will give important answers regarding loans to businesses and families,” he added.

The ECB is now due to come up with a new set of guidelines by March for provisions on existing bad loans - an even thornier issue in Italy, where lenders are sitting on a quarter of the euro zone’s total pile of bad loans.

Supervisors had been working on scenarios closely reflecting the guidelines on new NPLs but were now rethinking their approach due to the outcry in Italy, the sources told Reuters.

Italian banks’ non-performing exposure, which includes unpaid loans and other types of soured credit, fell by 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to 212 billion euros in the three months to June, the ECB quarterly statistics showed this week.

This week he unveiled his vision for NEOM, a shining city on the Red Sea where entrepreneurs will draft the rules and robots outnumber people. One day, the imagined metropolis may even become a publicly traded company.

While the likes of Dubai, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi have successfully gone some of the way, oil-rich Saudi has limited itself to industrial zones and financial centers – until NEOM. The megalopolis will encompass 26,500 square km, including 468 km of beachfront. It will border Jordan, link across the Red Sea to Egypt, and cost $500 billion to build.

The idea is almost bonkers, but that’s also its beauty. “The project will be the land of the future, where great minds and talents can create ground-breaking ideas and think outside the box, in a real world inspired by imagination,” according to Saudi’s Public Investment Fund, which will oversee the kingdom’s investment in NEOM.

If that’s not ambitious enough, NEOM will “without a doubt” go public, the crown prince told Reuters Breakingviews on Wednesday at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. “It’s as if you float the city of New York,” he said.

Of course New York already exists. And for global investors, the crown prince’s plan requires a healthy suspension of disbelief. But in the context of Saudi Arabia’s hopes to wean its economy off hydrocarbons, nothing can be off limits. Shifting from an era in which oil riches blessed its 33 million people, nearly 60 percent of whom are under 35, to a new model requires extraordinary creativity.

Yet to succeed, Saudi will need doers at least as much as dreamers: architects, engineers and construction workers. That makes the selection of Klaus Kleinfeld as chief executive of NEOM puzzling. In April, he lost the top job at Arconic, the specialty parts maker that split from Alcoa, after inappropriate contact with an activist investor. Before moving to Alcoa in 2007, he resigned as CEO of Siemens after losing the confidence of the industrial conglomerate’s board.

That said, Kleinfeld is a consummate networker. And the crown prince will need every kind of help he can get. The choice does, however, underline the huge challenge.

FILE PHOTO: Former director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey takes part in a panel discussion on Sharia law at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington February 12, 2011. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-woolsey/exclusive-while-advising-trump-in-2016-ex-cia-chief-proposed-plan-to-discredit-turkish-cleric-idINKBN1CV2SE?il=0

The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is central to the government’s plan to leave the EU in March 2019, repealing the laws that made Britain an EU member and transposing existing EU law into British law.

But it has faced widespread criticism from lawmakers of all parties - including May’s Conservatives - for giving the government too much power to change laws, and for not guaranteeing parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit.

As a result, the bill’s passage through parliament will depend on May’s fragile minority government being able to pacify rebel lawmakers who said they were “deadly serious” about trying to give parliament a greater say on the terms of the EU exit.

The much-anticipated first two days of debate were announced in parliament by Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house. Six further days of debate are planned but dates were not announced.

The bill passed its first parliamentary test in September and the next stage had been expected earlier by some lawmakers, but the government said it needed time to look over the hundreds of proposed changes which will be discussed.

“Nearly 400 amendments have been tabled and we are looking at those with the utmost seriousness,” a Brexit department spokeswoman said.

“We look forward to continuing the debate and working with Parliament to ensure that we deliver a functioning statute book on exit day.”

Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker later warned that if the bill fails to pass through parliament in time for “Brexit day” on March 29 2019, holes would appear in the country’s laws.

He also said the government currently planned separate legislation to implement the terms of the transitional agreement it is seeking to help smooth its departure from the EU, erecting another potentially difficult parliamentary hurdle.

May’s spokeswoman later said it was too soon to know for sure if this would be required.

DEADLY SERIOUS

Among the proposed changes to the withdrawal bill, several have enough support from Conservative lawmakers to defeat May, who commands a slim 13-seat working majority in the 650-seat parliament thanks to a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.

One of the potential Conservative rebels, Nicky Morgan, warned the government not to underestimate their desire to change the bill. “We are deadly serious,” Morgan, a former senior minister who was sacked by May last year, told parliament.

Any rebellion is expected to crystallise around government plans to offer lawmakers a vote on the final exit package.

The promise is not currently written into the bill, which will only allow lawmakers to accept the deal the government has negotiated with Brussels or reject it and leave the EU without a deal.

Brexit minister David Davis angered parliamentarians on Wednesday by suggesting that vote could even come after Britain has left the bloc, forcing his department to issue a clarification.

Called to parliament on Thursday morning to explain his words, Davis said he expected the vote to take place before December 2018 or January 2019, referring to the EU’s preferred negotiating timetable.

Despite his clarification, lawmakers signaled they wanted to have more say on the exit deal and would try to force the government into making concessions next month in parliament by guaranteeing in law a vote that gives lawmakers a greater say.

“The sad reality is that ministerial assurances are no longer good enough,” said opposition lawmaker Stephen Kinnock.",UK sets date for parliamentary showdown on crucial Brexit laws,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britiain-eu-lawmaking/uk-sets-date-for-parliamentary-showdown-on-crucial-brexit-laws-idUSKBN1CV1GO?il=0

It said it would cut its bond purchases in half from January but also extend the buying program until the end of next September.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was recovering but still needed support.

“Domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy,” he told a news conference. “Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary.”

Designed nearly three years ago, the bond buys worth more than 2 trillion euros depressed borrowing costs and lifted growth but failed to raise inflation to the ECB’s target of almost 2 percent.

That forced the bank to hedge its bets with what some investors described as “dovish policy tightening”.

The ECB will now cut its bond buys in half to 30 billion euros a month from January given robust growth, it kept the option to raise or extend buys and promised to reinvest maturing funds for years to come.

It also promised banks ample liquidity and said the bond buys would not end suddenly, suggesting that another extension, even if only to gradually wind down purchases, is likely.

“This is not tapering, it’s just a down-size,” Draghi said, using the market term for beginning to exit a stimulus program.

“The decision today is for an open-ended program ... it’s not going to stop suddenly,” he added. “There is still a large amount of uncertainty.”

The cautious move may also have reflected policymakers' concern about the euro's appreciation against the dollar EUR= this year and their aim to keep the currency stable after its surge over the summer.

The euro fell nearly 0.8 percent on the day even as Draghi omitted a now customary reference about the need to monitor the currency.

“Today’s decision is the first real baby step towards a very gentle exit from the ECB’s crisis mode, but it is definitely not a big-bang u-turn,” ING Economist Carsten Brzeski said.

“In fact, the ... recalibration illustrates the ECB wants to start the exit as cautiously as possible, ideally without seeing the euro appreciate or bond yields increase.”

DILEMMA

The biggest debate appeared to be about whether to keep asset buys open ended, with Draghi highlighting dissent from hawks, who wanted the ECB pave the way to the exit.

Still, Draghi said there was a large majority for an open-ended program while other issues were supported by consensus or near consensus.

Hawks such as Germany and the Netherlands have argued that growth is now above trend and more purchases do next to nothing for inflation, so keeping the program open ended is not justified. Doves on the bloc’s periphery, however, warned that a quick exit could tighten financial conditions, undoing years of work.

“The fact that the ECB made the tapering decision look as dovish as possible because of the weak inflation causes a risk of a later move in rates than in our forecast,” Nordea economist Tuuli Koivu said.

“The possible first rate hike – even if only a cosmetic in nature - that we expect to see in the first quarter of 2019 may come later,” he added.

Slideshow (2 Images)

The ECB’s problem is that while it is dealing with a superb growth run, which justifies reduced stimulus, inflation is barely responding.

Draghi said data pointed to unabated growth as employment rises, households continue to spend and exports are on the upswing.

Yet, underlying inflation has not yet shown any convincing signs of an upwards trend and the outlook for both inflation and growth remained conditional on continued support from the ECB.

“If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration,” Draghi said.

Interest rates were left unchanged as expected and the ECB reaffirmed its guidance to keep them unchanged until well after its bond buys end.

The ECB, meanwhile is slowly running out of bonds to buy, But Draghi dismissed arguments that scarcity of available debt would constrain the program as the ECB had plenty of flexibility.

Still, economists argue that the ECB will be nearing its limits by the end of its nine month extension, particularly in Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, making another extension difficult without a major redesign of parameters.

“Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,” Draghi said.

Visco, whose mandate expires at the end of this month, is a board member of the European Central Bank and is considered a close ally of ECB President Mario Draghi, who was his predecessor at the Bank of Italy.

He has been attacked by parties of all political stripes following the collapse of 10 Italian banks over the past two years, with the most recent broadsides coming from Gentiloni’s main backer, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who leads the ruling Democratic Party (PD).

However, Visco, who has blamed a prolonged economic turndown for the banking crisis, maintained the crucial backing of Gentiloni and President Sergio Mattarella, political sources told Reuters.

Renzi said earlier on Thursday that the Bank of Italy had done a poor job of banking oversight under Visco and he would prefer to see him replaced, flanking the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which has campaigned actively for Visco to go.

“The Bank of Italy has been a weak point in the system,” Renzi said in a radio interview. “If they consider it is worth the effort to reconfirm Ignazio Visco, I hope the next six years will be better. I can’t see how they could be worse.”

Gentiloni made his recommendation in a letter sent to the Bank of Italy’s ruling body, its Superior Council, three political sources told Reuters.

The proposal must now be approved by the council, which will meet on Friday, and then signed off on by Mattarella. Both are expected to give their green light.

With a national election due by May next year, the problems at Italian banks have become a focal point of the political battle.

In a surprise move that sparked an institutional tug of war with Mattarella, Renzi’s PD tabled a motion in parliament this month criticizing Visco, whose re-appointment had previously been considered almost a formality.

Renzi has since continued to criticize Visco, saying the party did not support him, while adding that Gentiloni was free to propose whom he wanted for the job.

The PD, as the ruling party, had itself been targeted by the opposition after the bank collapses wiped out the savings of thousands of people who held shares and bonds in the lenders.

Trump’s search has come down to Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor, according to a Politico report. A White House official told Reuters that no final decision had been made.

Teck, the world’s second-biggest exporter of steelmaking coal, said it expects a larger proportion of its coal sales in the fourth quarter to be non-premium coal, reducing its average realized price to about 85 percent of benchmark prices.

Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice.

Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary.

“For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. “Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.”

Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters.

Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to integrate Waymo’s self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans.

The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.

General Motors Co (GM.N) chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in “quarters not years.”

Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather.

One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers.

Graham testified for only six minutes, telling jurors he knows the New Jersey senator to be a “very honest, trustworthy man,” according to Twitter posts from a reporter from the Star-Ledger newspaper who was in the courtroom.

Democrat Cory Booker, who is New Jersey’s junior senator, also is expected to testify as a character witness. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, has previously attended the trial in support of Menendez.

A statement from Graham’s office said his testimony would be about his service with Menendez and not about the charges against him. Graham, who represents South Carolina, traveled at his own expense, the statement said.

As Menendez entered the courthouse on Thursday, he told reporters he was “honored” that Graham and Booker would testify.

Menendez, 63, is accused of taking bribes from a wealthy benefactor, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to help Melgen.

Menendez and Melgen have denied wrongdoing, saying their relationship was simply a close friendship.

Prosecutors say Menendez intervened on Melgen’s behalf with Medicare officials after the agency concluded the doctor had overbilled it by millions of dollars. Melgen was convicted separately earlier this year of a massive Medicare fraud.

Menendez also is accused of pressuring federal officials to secure visas for Melgen’s girlfriends and resolving a port dispute involving one of Melgen’s businesses.

In exchange for Menendez’s aid, Melgen gave the senator private flights, luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign money, prosecutors said.

The case has been closely watched in Washington, where Republicans hold a 52-48 edge in the Senate.

“Ragnarok,” part of Walt Disney Co’s Marvel film franchise, is by far the biggest production for New Zealand director Waititi, who previously wrote and directed small, independent fare such as 2010’s “Boy” and 2016’s “Hunt For the Wilderpeople.”

But the comedy in “Ragnarok” is very much a trademark of Waititi, who likes to find comedy often by placing unlikely characters in mundane settings, such as vampires sharing an apartment in 2014’s cult hit “What We Do in the Shadows.” Waititi said in fact that the vampire mockumentary may be remade into an American TV series.

“I love the idea of ... Hulk and Thor (sitting) on the bed making up after an argument -- like, you don’t see that in these films,” Waititi said.

The sacking of Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of five opposition governors in Venezuela’s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all-powerful national legislative superbody aligned with President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling socialists.

“They held a secret, express session to remove him,” Guanipa’s spokeswoman Erika Gutierrez told Reuters of the morning meeting of Zulia’s state legislature.

Venezuela’s opposition Democratic Unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti-Maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month’s state elections.

Despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over Venezuela’s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five state compared to 18 for Maduro’s Socialist Party candidates.

Opposition leaders blamed both dirty tricks by the government, including the last-minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, and abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year.

Driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly could take office.

Four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but Guanipa said he would never “kneel before the dictatorship.”

“This is an assault on the will of the people,” he tweeted after his removal on Tuesday, denouncing a “coup” in the oil-rich state on the border with Colombia.","Venezuelan anti-Maduro governor sacked, opposition in chaos",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-opposition/venezuelan-anti-maduro-governor-sacked-opposition-in-chaos-idUSKBN1CV2MR?il=0

Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington accusing Islamabad of turning a blind eye or helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.

President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behaviour, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials.

Tillerson, on a tour of Asia and the Middle East, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday afternoon and met with Abbasi, as well as Pakistan’s powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

“We are committed in the war against terror,” Abbasi told Tillerson, as the two men sat facing each other on a long table.

“We have produced results. And we are looking forward to moving ahead with the U.S. and building a tremendous relationship,” added Abbasi, who sat next to Bajwa.

During a short part of the meeting available to media, Tillerson told the Pakistani delegation that the nuclear-armed nation was an important U.S. ally in the region.

“(Pakistan is) important regionally to our joint goals of providing peace and security to the region and providing opportunity for greater economic relationship as well,” Tillerson said.

U.S officials say they are frustrated that Afghan Taliban and Haqqani militants are afforded freedom of movement and are able to transport weapons and raise funds inside Pakistan, something their Islamabad counterparts staunchly deny.

On Monday, during a visit to Kabul, Tillerson urged Pakistan to act against safe havens on its soil.

“Pakistan needs to, I think, take a clear-eyed view of the situation that they are confronted with in terms of the number of terrorist organisations that find safe haven inside of Pakistan.”

“RED LINE”

Pakistani officials bristle at the idea that the country is not doing enough against militants and say Pakistan has suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the war on terror since the Sept. 11 attacks in United States in 2001.

In recent years Pakistan has made substantial gains against militants and the number of attacks have drastically reduced, but some militant groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State continue to pose a threat and have periodically staged large-scale attacks.

Pakistan recently started to fence its long and porous 2,500-km border with Afghanistan in an attempt to stop militants criss-crossing the frontier.

As well as support for the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, another sticking point in the relationship has been growing closeness by the United States to India, Pakistan’s arch-foe and neighbour.

Tillerson said last week that the Trump administration wanted to “dramatically deepen” cooperation with New Delhi, partly to offset Chinese influence in Asia. Trump has also called for greater Indian role in Afghanistan.

But this deepening in ties has alarmed Pakistan, which has rejected a greater political role for India for Afghanistan as a “red line” for Islamabad.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”.

Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

Per quanto riguarda il processo di risanamento di Alitalia, Paleari anticipa che “il secondo semestre del 2017 si chiuderà con un ebitda in sostanziale pareggio”. E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Paleari, però, si lamenta dei “costi esterni che gravano su Alitalia”. E riserva una critica ad AdR (Atlantia: la compagnia paga “oltre 200 milioni all‘aeroporto di Fiumicino... siamo costretti a sostenere costi crescenti pur restando a parità di servizi”. Pertanto, il commissario chiede una discussione “su come arrivare ad una competizione (nei trasporti) su basi più equilibrate e paritarie”.

“Quello del commissario straordinario Paleari è un discorso relativo ai costi sostenuti dalla compagnia aerea. Con Adr c‘è un costante dialogo nella ricerca delle migliori soluzioni per la soddisfazione dell‘utente e la crescita del traffico aereo italiano” precisa l‘ufficio stampa Alitalia.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Atlantia, che ha annunciato un‘operazione da circa 15,7 miliardi in estate, scoprirà le sue carte dopo che l‘autorità di mercato spagnola avrà approvato l‘operazione ACS-Hochtief ma, fin d‘ora, sembra deciso che resterà una offerta in contanti e azioni, con la parte probabilmente cash migliorata, secondo una delle fonti. “Sarà un‘offerta che metterà la parola fine alla saga”.

La decisione finale verrà comunque presa dopo il via libera della Cnmv, secondo un‘altra fonte.

Nel frattempo ACS-Hochtief lavora alla sua proposta da 17,1 miliardi, cercando di abbassare l‘indebitamento che ne deriverà. La componente cash sfiora infatti i 15 miliardi, valore per cui è stato ottenuto un finanziamento.

Oltre alla ricerca di investitori che affianchino il gruppo nell‘operazione, tra le ipotesi allo studio c‘è la cessione di una quota di minoranza della concessionaria autostradale francese Sanef, controllata da Abertis.

ACS, che ieri ha detto per bocca del suo Ceo che l‘offerta è migliorabile e che la sede della filiale delistata resterà in Spagna, punta a limitare l‘indebitamento che scaturirebbe dall‘operazione, un elemento che le agenzie di rating vedono come punto critico.

L‘incasso per Hochtief potrebbe variare da oltre 1 miliardo per un 20% circa a oltre 2 miliardi per una quota sopra il 40%.

Altre cessioni di asset Abertis, come noto, potrebbero riguardare il 34% dell‘operatore nelle torri di trasmissione Cellnex e i satelliti di Hispasat.

L‘offerta ACS-Hochtief valuta Abertis 18,76 euro in contanti. In alternativa il concambio vede un rapporto di 0,1281 nuove azioni Hochtief ogni titolo Abertis. Hochtief farebbe un aumento di capitale per 24,79 milioni di nuove azioni che diluirebbe ACS dall‘attuale 72%.

L‘operazione è condizionata ad adesioni per almeno il 50% più un‘azione del capitale Abertis e ad adesioni alla componente carta per almeno il 20% del capitale Abertis.

ATLANTIA

Sul fronte Atlantia, più fonti fannno notare che non c‘è fretta nell‘annunciare un rilancio, considerato che il via libera di Cnmv dovrebbe arrivare verso Natale.

“Per febbraio speriamo di poter chiudere l‘operazione”, auspica una fonte.

I parametri verranno definiti alla luce dell‘andamento dei titoli interessati. Una delle opzioni allo studio sarebbe comunque quella di rendere le azioni Atlantia date in concambio ai soci Abertis immediatamente scambiabili sul mercato, eliminando il lockup previsto fino al febbraio 2019.

“La componente in carta resta fondamentale perchè alcuni azionisti di Abertis, a partire da Caixa, hanno mostrato apprezzamento per un titolo che darebbe un flusso costante di dividendi”, dice la fonte.

Prima che venisse annunciata la contro offerta di ACS, che ha congelato quella dei concorrenti, oltre il 50% del capitale Abertis si era mostrato favorevole all‘operazione proposta da Atlantia.

Atlantia offre a tutti gli azionisti Abertis 16,50 euro in contanti per il 77% del capitale e per il restante 23% un concambio con titoli Atlantia speciali, non trasferibili fino al 15 febbraio 2019.

AGENZIE DI RATING IN ATTESA DI SVILUPPIU

Ieri Fitch ha abbassato il credit watch di Abertis a “negativo” da “evolving” dopo l‘annuncio di Hochtief, mossa che “riflette l‘incertezza sul livello del debito dell‘entità combinata” che nascerebbe dall‘aggregazione.

S&P ha cambiato l‘outlook su Abertis a “developing” da “positivo” sull‘incertezza sui futuri assetti societari. In caso di successo dell‘offerta tedesca, il rating potrebbe rimanere invariato o essere abbassato di un notch.

In caso di successo dell‘operazione promossa da Atlantia, il rating di Abertis si allineerebbe a quello di Atlantia, attualmente di un gradino superiore con creditwatch negativo.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Girardi, who won a World Series title in 2009 and guided the Yankees to the post-season in six of his 10 seasons as manager, had just concluded a four-year, $16 million contract with the storied ball club.

”I want to thank Joe for his 10 years of hard work and service to this organization,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a statement.

“Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration, and we’ve decided to pursue alternatives for the managerial position.”

The Yankees did not name a replacement.

After managing the Florida Marlins for one season in 2006, Girardi took over the Yankees in 2008 and in his second season with the club lead them to their 27th World Series title.

Girardi compiled a 910-710 record while at the helm of one of baseball’s most storied franchises and his win total ranks sixth in Yankees history.

He also won three championships with the Yankees as a player and is one of three individuals in franchise history to play for and manage a Yankees World Championship team.

While the 53-year-old did lead the Yankees on an unexpected deep playoff run his post-season was marred by managerial mistakes during a Game Two loss to the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series.

The settlement, with RBS Securities Inc, was announced on Thursday by U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut.

RBS will pay a $35 million fine, plus at least $9.09 million of restitution to more than 30 customers including Pacific Investment Management Co, Soros Fund Management, and affiliates of Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

The bank cooperated with the probe, and the criminal probe into individuals associated with its trading will continue.

“RBS has zero tolerance for market misconduct,” the bank said in a statement. “We are pleased to be able to resolve this issue as we continue to build a simpler, stronger bank that is fully focused on serving our customers well.”

The settlement arose from a now five-year federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading in which eight traders, including two from RBS, have been criminally charged.

Daly said RBS schemed from 2008 to 2013 to defraud customers in trades of residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized bond obligations, hoping to boost its profit at customers’ expense.

The development underscores tension between Myanmar and the United Nations, which in April criticized the government’s previous plan to resettle Rohingya Muslims displaced by last year’s violence in “camp-like” villages.

More than 600,000 have crossed to Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked an army crackdown. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since then amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.

The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Thursday that UN-Habitat had agreed to provide technical assistance in housing displaced people in Rakhine and the agency would work closely with the authorities to “implement the projects to be favorable to Myanmar’s social culture and administrative system”.

But Stanislav Saling, spokesman for the office of the U.N. resident coordinator in Myanmar, told Reuters in an email that “no agreements were reached so far” after the agency’s representatives attended a series of meetings with Myanmar officials this week in its capital Naypyitaw.

“The UN-Habitat mission emphasized that resettlement should be conducted in accordance with the principles of housing and property restitution for refugees and displaced persons to support their safe and dignified return to their places of origin,” he said, responding on behalf of UN-Habitat.

UN-Habitat welcomed the interest of the Myanmar government in international norms and standards, he added.

The United Nations’ principles state that all refugees or displaced persons have the right to return to property or land from which they were arbitrarily or unlawfully removed.

Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return, but it remains unclear whether those refugees would be allowed to return to their homes.

Rohingya who return to Myanmar are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to Myanmar officials and plans seen by Reuters.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar in August suggested that UN agencies such as the World Food Program have provided food to Rohingya insurgents, adding to pressure on aid groups which had to suspend activities in Rakhine and pull out most of their staff.

Still, Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare who attended the meetings with UN-Habitat, insisted that the agency had agreed to give assistance and the two sides will meet again on November 8.

“We have reached an agreement with the UN for technical assistance. We will discuss more details on how to proceed,” he told Reuters.

The Myanmar military said on Thursday that it will withdraw “some” of the security forces carrying out clearance operations in northern Rakhine and dispatch them to the state capital, Sittwe, as an auxiliary force.
