Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened. Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study.

Oysters “must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents,” which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study. “To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.”

Not being able to detect other natural events, like rainfall or thunderstorms, could also prevent them from knowing when it’s time to spawn, Dr. Massabuau said.","Yes, Oysters Can ‘Hear.’ They Probably Wish We’d Clam Up.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/science/oysters-noise-pollution.html

In an age where you can order just about anything on the internet, including wine, consumers deserve safe access to great retailers over state borders.","But now, states — urged on by wine and spirits wholesalers who oppose any sort of interstate alcohol commerce that bypasses them — have stepped up enforcement efforts. Retailers say that the carriers began sending out letters to them a year ago saying they would no longer handle their shipments.

For consumers who live in states stocked with fine-wine retailers, like New York, the restrictions are an inconvenience. For consumers in states with few retail options, they are disastrous. It’s hard enough outside major metropolitan areas to find wines from small producers. The crackdown makes it that much harder.

Before the internet, the bigger wine shops sometimes printed periodic catalogs for their customers, particularly around the holidays. If those catalogs found their way into hands in other states and enticed a few far-flung sales, it was no big deal one way or the other.

Broadband changed everything. No longer did retailers have to identify and attract potential customers. With a few clicks of the mouse, eager consumers could seek out wine shops all over the country, scour their inventories and order the bottles they wanted.

“That’s one of the happy miracles of the age,” said Jamie Wolff, an owner of Chambers Street Wines in New York.

Like other retailers I spoke with, Mr. Wolff was not willing to offer precise sales figures, but he said a significant amount of Chambers Street’s business had been from out of state.

“It seems a shame to tell consumers anywhere that they can’t freely purchase something they want,” he said.

Until 2005, many retailers quietly engaged in interstate business without much fuss. But that year, which roughly coincided with the widespread access to high-speed internet, the Supreme Court ruling in Granholm v. Heald effectively lifted many state bans on buying directly from out-of-state wineries.

Though the ruling applied to wineries, not to retailers, Granholm had a liberating effect on consumers who suddenly found it much easier to find the wines they wanted online. The decision also allows the direct shipment of wines purchased by tourists at wineries to all states.

The efforts to curtail interstate shipping, many retailers believe, are a result of heavy lobbying by wine and spirits wholesalers, supported by generous campaign contributions to state legislators and other elected officials. In New York State, for example, wholesalers have given $2.7 million to candidates for office, compared with $678,000 donated by retailers, according to the Nation Institute on Money in State Politics.

“Wholesalers have been looking at this issue for quite some time,” said Daniel Posner, owner of Grapes the Wine Company, a retailer in White Plains. “They went to state liquor authorities and said, ‘People aren’t following the laws.’ Now it’s all coming to a brutal end.”

Mr. Posner, who also is president of the National Association of Wine Retailers, an advocacy group, said about half of Grapes’ business was with out-of-state clients, primarily in New Jersey and Connecticut. He said the potential ramifications for his small business, with its 12 employees, were huge.

“As in anything in business, this is pure greed,” he said. “There are very few industries that are so regulated. We have an authority that looks over us, that makes sure we pay our bills on time. We have a very rigid system in place, state by state. These wholesalers, they hold all the cards.”

The wholesalers, for their part, insist that their interest is solely to protect consumers from fraud, threats to health and underage drinking.

In a phone conversation, Craig Wolf, president and chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, a trade group, posed a nightmarish scenario of teenagers in New York ordering Thunderbird — the cheap, flavored fortified wine of skid rows and song — from retailers in Nevada.

“New York can’t hold Nevada accountable,” he said. “Multiply that out by tens of thousands. There’s no jurisdiction for retailers at the federal level.”

I suggested that the example was far-fetched, but Mr. Wolf pivoted, pointing to several cases in Europe where people had died from drinking counterfeit spirits. The states, which have the power to license retailers, he asserted, keep them honest. Allowing retailers to sell out of state, he suggested, created a scenario for an unregulated system to run amok.

“With everybody licensed, the supply chain is guaranteed top to bottom,” he said.

Wholesalers have argued for years that such tight regulation, which happens to be to their commercial advantage, is all that protects the wine and spirits business from descending into chaos. The Supreme Court did not buy the argument in 2005, and to me, their economic interest seems a far more likely motivation than public health.

For years, wholesalers around the country have been consolidating into bigger and bigger entities. The American wine market was worth around $62 billion in 2016, and according to Forbes magazine, revenues at the top three wholesalers accounted for almost half of that value. The more fragmented the wholesalers can keep the market, the better they insure their place in it.

Retailers will adapt to the restrictions on interstate sales, though it will not be easy. Devin Warner, president of the Chicago Wine Company, a retailer, said 50 percent of its sales go out of Illinois.

“We’ve felt the pinch of states closing down,” he said. “We’re just going to have to look for other ways to replace that business.”

At the same time, retailers are lobbying for bills that would loosen restrictions on web purchases. A bill in New York that would permit out-of-state retailers to ship to New York died in committee last year, Mr. Posner said. He is hoping the bill will be reintroduced in January.

“The internet has allowed many industries to go forward, but this is sending us backward,” he said.

Independent retailers also face the threat of consolidation. Costco is now the biggest wine retailer in the country, and Amazon is now getting into selling wine, a move that has been given brick-and-mortar significance by its recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which has many outlets with retail wine licenses.

This does not affect New York retailers so much as New York law restricts retailers to one license, and therefore one store, in the state. But around the country it means fewer choices for consumers. Curtailing out-of-state shipping only makes it worse.

In an age where you can order just about anything on the internet, including wine, consumers deserve safe access to great retailers over state borders.

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”So, pass the matches.","Of course, this is a post-“Da Vinci Code” world in which no thriller can turn up with a single, white male expert (prone to the odd quip while staring down the end of civilization) without recalling Robert Langdon, he of the black turtlenecks and the knack for symbols. Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.

We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation’s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin — and the reader — have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel’s narrative like one of Trent Reznor’s dark guitar chords: “Wasn’t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.”

“We can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.”

“Instead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.”

A description of Google’s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: “It was insinuated in every facet of people’s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.” From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there’s nothing to be done about it. It’s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don’t even know that we’re sick.

“I can’t tell which is the immune system anymore and which the disease — whether we’re defending or attacking ourselves,” Jackie, a Google employee whom Martin long ago rescued from death, admits.

He might have been talking about the comments section on HuffPost.

A similar widespread villainy lies at the heart of David Ignatius’s THE QUANTUM SPY (Norton, $25.95), a somber espionage procedural about the race to build the world’s first quantum computer — a theoretical frontier at the intersection of computer science and quantum physics. Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist who has long covered the C.I.A., and he happily takes us for a jaunt through a world of anonymous hotel rooms and conference tables across Beijing and Vancouver and Dubai, where decisions to take someone off “the shelf” (i.e., bring him or her back into action) are blankly relayed and executed. American start-ups on the brink of game-changing innovation are visited by a C.I.A. officer, a “lean, putty-faced man with a bad haircut” who quietly demands for the United States government to be their only client. Operatives aspire to the “highest art” of their profession: to “appear ordinary.”

Here, the ostensible enemy is a mole inside the C.I.A. known as Rukou, or the Doorway, whom the C.I.A. must ferret out and eliminate, all the while keeping the Chinese away from their technological breakthroughs — a Sisyphean exercise if ever there was one.

The mood is mournful and restrained. The C.I.A.’s vibe feels like a highway motel with thin walls, a smell of chlorine, a vending machine where your Twix gets stuck on the glass. The most delightful aspect of the book is the characterization of the Chinese — their expletive-ridden insults, downbeat perspective (“Bad luck is always hiding inside the doorway, down the next hutong”), and quirks. Chinese agents carry a mijian with them at all times, “a small, leatherbound diary” in which they write things “that were never, ever to be shared.” In one fascinating scene set in Mexico, a Chinese agent with a Spanish accent unnerves the Chinese-American hero, Harris Chang, by unveiling Chang’s own secret political Chinese ancestry to him. It proves to be a surprisingly powerful interrogation technique: “He was uncomfortable. It was as if someone else had taken possession of his life story.”

It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build “one world” — a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook’s hope to “bring the world closer together.” But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang’s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: “He occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.” The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.

In Michelle Richmond’s THE MARRIAGE PACT (Bantam, $27), a different kind of evil is in play, this one just as intangible and pernicious. Giddy and in love, two Bay Area newlyweds, Alice and Jake, receive a Molotov cocktail of a wedding present: an invitation to join “The Pact,” a hush-hush society-cum-cult, the details of which are pitched to them “Glengarry Glen Ross”-style by Vivian, a beautiful woman in a yellow dress with a politician’s pivot and spin.

The Pact is a “fellowship of like-minded individuals” dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is “highly effective, scientifically based.” Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.

Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an “impenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.” But Alice and Jake — apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, “Shoot first and ask questions later” — agree to Vivian’s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with “an impressively large stack of profiteroles,” where they chat with women who say things like: “Stupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.”

Jake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: “I would’ve stopped it, Jake. I could’ve saved you. Now it’s too late.”

It’s a fun, can’t-stop-eating-the-potato-chips kind of premise. Jake — a marriage counselor who has little insight into his own relationships — descends into a labyrinth of paranoia and isolation as he investigates the truth behind The Pact, all the while lying to his wife and enduring one level of punishment after the next. (Apparently, when it comes to marital harmony, de Sade was really on to something.) The book is at its strongest when Richmond describes The Pact’s manual in a wickedly deadpan style. It sounds like something between a tutorial for new guards on Rikers Island and MarriageTM by the Mad Hatter: “Failure to provide three or more gifts in a single calendar year should be treated as a Class 5 Felony.” Then there is the Focus Mechanism, one of a range of contraptions designed to help you stay attentive to your significant other (QVC, take note): “The collar circles her neck, extending all the way up to her jawline, where it cups her chin.”

As Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.

In Christopher Swann’s first novel, SHADOW OF THE LIONS (Algonquin, $26.95), we are whisked into another type of cult: Blackburne, an elite all-boys private school in the Virginia countryside, rife with its own odd rituals and unspoken understandings. “A warning shake of the head meant Watch out.” “Cutting your eyes away from a classmate you passed in the hall could be as cruel as sneering in his face.”

Our protagonist is Matthias Glass — a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York’s literary scene with a “long-legged, pouty” model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods — and “off the edge of the earth.” He was never seen again.

Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class “in a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.” Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing — the desire to “conquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,” or how being labeled gay constituted “the worst, most devastating blow” that left the accused “cast into the outer darkness.”

Blackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet’s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: “Doubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.” It’s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.

Danya Kukafka’s bewitching first novel, GIRL IN SNOW (Simon & Schuster, $26), spins a spell of mournful confession around a “Twin Peaks”-like centerpiece, the beautiful girl found dead: “Lucinda Hayes broke her neck. Cracked it on the edge of the carousel.” The truth is revealed through the claustrophobic confessions of three misfits, observations Kukafka gently takes out and holds up to the light as if sifting through a refuse-filled gutter after a rain. There is Russ, the restrained police officer investigating Lucinda’s murder; Jade, a resentful fellow classmate who makes sense of people and events by stuffing them into the skeletal format of a screenplay; and Cameron, the obsessive loner who stalked Lucinda: “Cameron had started playing Statue Nights when he was 12 years old.” In Kukafka’s capable hands, villainy turns out to be everywhere and nowhere, a DNA that could be found under the fingernails of everybody’s hands.

In THE MURDERS OF MOLLY SOUTHBOURNE (Tor/Forge, paper, $11.99), a scold’s bridle of a coming-of-age tale by Tade Thompson, we meet the protagonist of the title agonizing in her “universe defined by pain.” Every time Molly bleeds, the blood gives birth to a dimwitted, monstrous version of herself, a ghoulish other “molly” who, after a period of incubation, blasts out of doors and from under the bed, bloodthirsty and dangerous. Molly must kill these doppelgängers before they kill her. And thus unspools a horrifying childhood. She learns to murder and dispose of human flesh with the precision of a Tarantino fixer (“When her parents arrive she is lying on a pile of corpses she’d been trying to clean”), all the while enjoying the ABCs of adolescence: first kisses, running away from home, Rudyard Kipling.

The most compelling aspects of the book are not just Thompson’s dagger prose (“In these teenage years she kills three mollys a week, sometimes as many as one a day”), but also the blunt paragraphs and truncated chapters through which he reveals Molly’s reality. It has the effect of a slide show in Art History 101. In darkness, we are shown a series of close-ups: gnarled hand, decapitated head, a foot, some blood, fragments that make little sense until the final portrait is revealed. It’s as unsettling as one of Francis Bacon’s screaming popes, or the Lucian Freud painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping”: a bold outpouring of flesh and crisis at once horrifying and familiar.

Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.

The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily — slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted détente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.

We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it’s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn’t good. It seems these days we’re not only uncertain of everything and everyone — foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads — we’re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”

“It’s not just about abortion,” she said in a 2007 interview with CUNY-TV in New York. “It’s about economic opportunity. It’s about the nutrition programs. It’s about who’s going on the Supreme Court next. It’s about everything that impacts women, which is everything.”

Rita Jane Henley was born on Jan. 1, 1947, in Columbus. Her father, Justin, was a journalist, and her mother, the former Mary Elizabeth Downey, was a homemaker.

Her first journalism job was with The Paterson News in New Jersey, where she was a reporter from 1977 to 1979. Then came the position at the Stamford paper and the Brink’s robbery, a botched job attempted by members of the Black Liberation Army and other radicals, for which Ms. Boudin went to prison.

Ms. Jensen brought legal action against the company. Central to the dispute was whether she had known the real identity of Ms. Boudin, who was using the name Lynn Adams. Ms. Jensen said at the time that she had known who Ms. Boudin was and had so informed her editor, but that later news accounts had misconstrued the careful wording they had devised to skirt the issue.

“The media picked up the story, added and subtracted a word here and there, and suddenly I was quoted denying that I knew Lynn Adams was actually Kathy Boudin,” she said.

As Ms. Jensen eased back into journalism, she was writing about women’s issues even before she started Women’s eNews. Her personal experience with spousal abuse made her a lifelong advocate for providing women in difficult circumstances with support.

“The resources available to battered women in need of assistance have drifted steadily downward during the past 20 years,” she wrote in 1996, when President Bill Clinton was pushing changes to the welfare system.

“In 1973, my children and I lived in Ohio and received $204 a month or about 75 percent of the average need,” she said, adding, “Twenty-three years later, the maximum family of three in Ohio receives $341 or less than half of the average need.”

The issue was not just dollars and cents, she continued.

“I am willing to go so far as to say the ongoing Republican and conservative Democratic campaigns against welfare inflame the hatred of the attackers and further diminish low-income women’s self-respect and are therefore contributing factors to domestic violence,” she wrote.

Violence against women was only one of the issues Ms. Jensen and the journalists she edited and mentored dug into at Women’s eNews. Single motherhood, health, women’s legal status and more received scrutiny, and the site looked far beyond the borders of the United States. In 2003 it started an Arabic version after noticing that its articles were drawing a lot of readers in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Most recently, Ms. Jensen had been concerned with high mortality rates among women giving birth in parts of the United States, a subject she wrote about for cnn.com in May. She had recently left Women’s eNews and started the Jane Crow Project to combat that problem, especially among African-American women.

She also occasionally wrote about her breast cancer. In a straightforward, often droll article for sheknows.com in 2016, she recounted her decision not to have reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy.

“I do not regret that I decided to drop a boob,” she wrote. “I do regret that the post-mastectomy bathing suit I bought is ugly, by my lights. I would really like my black Speedo back.”

Ms. Jensen’s marriage to James Jensen in 1965 ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Jensen-Vargas, she is survived by another daughter, Shasta Jensen; three brothers, Dick, Paul and Mark Henley; and four grandchildren.

Ms. Jensen was always quick to acknowledge the help she received in hard times, whether from an aid program or the good Samaritan who got her to orientation on her first day at Ohio State.

Having no money for transportation, she hoped to hitchhike to the university, dropping her two girls off at two different day care centers on the way. That improbable plan succeeded when a man in a red sports car pulled over in the rain; the stranger dropped the two children off, then dropped her off, even letting her bum one of his cigarettes.

“When he let me out, I thanked him,” she recalled, recounting the moment in the anthology “Nothing but the Truth So Help Me God: 73 Women on Life’s Transitions” (2014). “He nodded, revved his engine and sped off.”","Rita Henley Jensen, Founder of Women’s eNews, Dies at 70",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/rita-jensen-dead-journalist-founded-womens-enews.html

Plants modify tyrosine by adding other molecules to create an enormous array of useful substances. This is how morphine is made in the opium poppy, and mescaline in cactuses.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

Still, the staging gives the illusion that something dynamic and new is happening. In an odd way, Mr. Herrin’s hilarious work on the recent production of “Noises Off” at the Roundabout Theater was excellent preparation. “People, Places & Things” is a kind of inverted farce, with all the doors slamming in the other direction.

But I kept waiting for something bigger than fine stagecraft — and even Ms. Gough’s extreme, ingenious performance — to kick in. In his touching play “Every Brilliant Thing” and in the brutal adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984” he wrote with Robert Icke, Mr. Macmillan demonstrated an eagerness to keep the audience engaged in static stories at all costs, and to send it off with a big finish.

These are usually admirable instincts, and they do, for the most part, keep us from wandering as Emma goes through her recovery laps. Even during the play’s longueurs — it feels a bit padded to achieve its length — you sense that larger questions are being assembled to deliver a gut-punch reversal at the end. When it comes, you must re-evaluate what you thought you knew. But Ben Brantley was right to ask, in his New York Times review of the play’s 2015 premiere at London’s National Theater, whether that effect is “enough to make theatergoers feel that their own long, often tedious path to enlightenment has been worth it.”

His answer was no. Mine is “yes, but.” However valuable and accurate “People, Places & Things” is as a portrait of the addict’s nightmare, in and out of rehab, the play really wants to weigh in on a more fundamental issue about addiction and responsibility. And on this note it seems to waffle as much as I do in responding to it. Perhaps this is the result of a contradiction built into recovery itself, at least as structured along the 12-step model: We play a large part in our own addictions yet we are powerless over them.

Mr. Macmillan develops the argument between these two ideas in a series of confrontations with three women: the recovery center’s doctor; its therapist; and, eventually, Emma’s mother. (It is thematically useful that all are played by Barbara Marten, who is brisk as the doctor, warm as the therapist and jaw dropping as the mother.) The first two women, as advocates for a process that is fundamentally structured around acceptance of a higher power, locate the source of addiction in a breach of humility: Addiction, the doctor suggests, is caused by trauma we flatter ourselves to think we can ignore or control.

Emma furiously rejects this interpretation, in ways that many an atheist and Foucaultian will recognize. “If it’s vital to my recovery that I come to believe in a power greater than me,” Emma fulminates, “then we might all just be wasting our time.” It is, she points out, the 21st century.

And though the doctor explains that her clinic employs a “religiously neutral” modification of the 12-step template — one in which addicts express powerlessness over the three nouns that make up the play’s title — she nevertheless (Emma notices witheringly) wears a crucifix. Further, the play is all too successful in replicating the sententiousness and sanctimony of recovery jargon, at least as overheard by an outsider.

So which is it? Is recovery (as Emma first sees it) a cult of ego deflation or (as she later sees it) a spiritual and medical response to trauma? It may be reasonable to suggest that, as she recovers, her position gradually changes, her punctured actorly narcissism fizzling with a long hiss. She leaves rehab a convert to its philosophy of personal responsibility. But then, as the play closes — I won’t spoil how — we are given devastating evidence that Emma’s addiction is not her fault at all, but rather the mark of the world’s cruelty to sensitive souls.

Are we not then all addicts? Or is the play simply addicted to its own effects?

If I was troubled by Mr. Macmillan’s philosophical opportunism — the story sometimes works like a toggle switch, flipped this way and that to maintain suspense — perhaps it’s because I am leery of a mechanistic approach to “issue drama.” And to recovery. Yet it is not the playwright’s job to provide answers to such questions. It is enough that he leaves you scraping the insides of your soul, looking for your own.","Review: The Horror Show of Rehab in ‘People, Places & Things’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/theater/people-places-things-review.html

But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.

“It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else,” Springer said. “When the last out is made you finally breathe.”

Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2. Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesday’s game without fraying some nerves.

“Two teams that competed for 27 outs,” Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. “An emotional roller coaster.”

The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece. They will return to action on Friday, with Houston’s Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.

The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles — it was 93 degrees at first pitch — should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable. Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.

“Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying,” said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason. “Doesn’t seem like the case the last couple of nights.”

Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregman’s single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on. But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.

Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later. Seager, last year’s National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers’ division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.

With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.

Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away. Facing the Dodgers’ stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puig’s glove as he dived for the ball. Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.

Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.

This time was different. The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros’ deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.

“I’ll take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning,” Roberts said.

The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers. Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros’ season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series. But he drilled a 94 m.p.h. cutter, Jansen’s trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.

It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.

“It was just flat,” Jansen said. “Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez. He didn’t miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.”

In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason. Altuve brought chants of “M.V.P.” when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.

Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot. The Astros’ dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.

“I loved it,” said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations. “He threw it higher than I normally do, and that’s way you should play in the World Series.”

Puig replaced the Astros’ euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th. Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.

With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddick’s throw to home plate.

As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski. And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez. It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate. Instead, it was a dead ball.

“Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him,” Hinch said with a smirk after the game.

“Republicans identify, at a deep psychological level, more strongly with their party than do Democrats,” according to Theodoridis:

The evidence is rather clear that the modern hyper-polarization is far more characterized by tribal division than by ideological distance. The real story seems to be the growing us-versus-them, in-group/out-group dynamic. If you look at what we call thermometer scores, which have respondents rate their feelings about groups from cold to warm, zero degrees to 100 degrees, the average rating of the other party has dropped from nearly 50 degrees in the early 1980s to temperatures in the 30s today.

Theodoridis summed up the conclusions he and his colleagues reached in a blog post in Scientific American in November 2016:

Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group. Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.

In other words, the assumption that many Republican voters would be repelled by Donald Trump turned out to be wrong; instead party loyalty — “a visceral, even subconscious, attachment” — takes precedence.

In fact, as the political scientists Leonie Huddy, Lilliana Mason and Lene Aarøe argue in an article in American Political Science Review, the most powerful form of partisanship is not principled, ideological commitment to conservative or liberal policies, but “expressive partisanship,” which is more of a gut commitment:

A subjective sense of belonging to a group that is internalized to varying degrees, resulting in individual differences in identity strength, a desire to positively distinguish the group from others, and the development of ingroup bias. Moreover, once identified with a group or, in this instance, a political party, members are motivated to protect and advance the party’s status and electoral dominance as a way to maintain their party’s positive distinctiveness.

Traditionally, political scientists have measured partisanship by asking voters the following questions: “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?” Those who say Republican or Democrat are then asked “Would you call yourself a strong Republican/Democrat or a not very strong Republican/Democrat?” Independents are asked “Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic Party?” Respondents are then ranked on a seven point scale from strong Democrat to strong Republican.

Political scientists measure expressive partisanship by looking at responses to more subjective questions, including “How important is being a Democrat or Republican to you?”, “How well does the term Democrat or Republican describe you?” and “When talking about Democrats or Republicans, how often do you use ‘we’ instead of ‘they’?”

It turns out, according to Huddy, Mason and Aarøe, that those who are strong partisans on the basis of emotional and expressive links to their parties feel angrier

when threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory. In contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats or reassurances.

These expressive partisans also

feel increased schadenfreude, a complex positive emotion, when they read about bad things happening to or reflecting poorly on a political candidate of the other party. They even feel this positive emotion in reaction to events that are clearly negative.

Three other political scientists — Shanto Iyengar, Gaurav Sood and Yphtach Lelkes — reached a similar conclusion in a 2012 paper, “Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization.”

They argue that instead of treating polarization in the general electorate as a conflict over competing policies, the better measure is “affective polarization,” which is their term for the way voters “not only increasingly dislike the opposing party,” but are also willing to “impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Iyengar and his co-authors contend that

affective polarization has permeated judgments about interpersonal relations, exceeds polarization based on other prominent social cleavages, and that levels of partisan affect are significantly higher in America.

In a 2017 paper, “All in the Eye of the Beholder: Asymmetry in Ideological Accountability,” Iyengar and Sood provide further insight into how so many Republicans found their way to voting for Trump.

They demonstrate that partisan voters’ approval of their party’s leaders “bears little relationship with their ideological extremity.” Because of this, candidates like Trump “enjoy considerable leeway to stake out positions at odds with the preferences of their supporters.”

Iyengar and Sood buttress their analysis by pointing out that from December 2008 to August 2010, “Sarah Palin’s support never once slipped below 69% among Republicans,” even though her positions were well to the right of the average Republican voter and she was subjected to brutal ridicule in the liberal media.

The growing strength of the kind of partisanship that is widespread today — whether you call it visceral, expressive, affective or tribal — undermines the workings of democratic governance. Not only are Republicans willing to support Trump, but both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to demonize the leadership of the opposing party.

Iyengar and Sood describe this as the “boomerang effect”:

The position attributed to a disliked party perceived as ideologically distant is pushed even further away from the receiver’s position. For instance, a Democrat who encounters a Republican campaign ad on government spending enlarges the discrepancy between herself and the Republican on the issue.

While attention has focused on Trump and the Republican Party (since both are in power), Democrats are hardly exempt from tribalism.

After Flake denounced Trump on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement making the point that Flake, like Corker, had waited until he was no longer seeking office to break Republican ranks:

Senator Flake voted with Donald Trump 91% of the time. His retirement is a symbol of a Republican Party whose leaders allow Donald Trump’s divisive politics to flourish as long as it serves their political interests, and who fail to criticize this dangerous president until it’s too late.

Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, tweeted: “When Dems attack those GOP pols who stand up to Trump, perhaps they are the ones putting party before country,” a comment picked up by Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, who added, “Yes, this seems to be a case of tribal loyalties coming out at the worst possible time.”

Along similar lines, Theodoridis and Stephen Goggin, a political scientist at San Diego State, asked 1609 voters whether two unnamed senators were Democrats or Republicans. One of the two was described as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Wins Anti-Corruption Award,” the other as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Admits to Lying.” Democrats consistently labeled the anti-corruption senator a Democrat and the liar a Republican, while Republicans took the opposite view.

Perhaps most importantly, hyperpolarization is a powerful disincentive to compromise. How can you make concessions to your mortal enemies? To even start negotiations can be viewed, in this context, as surrender.

Trump’s grip on his party remains firm. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: “Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?” The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.

Trump’s overall favorability ratings may be terrible (39 percent positive to 56 negative), according to a RealClearPolitics average of the eight most recent surveys, but the generic Democratic advantage is a relatively modest 9.2 percentage points. In an October 15-16 Economist/YouGov survey, Democratic voters said they planned to vote for Democratic House candidates 88-3 and Republicans said they would vote for Republican House candidates 86-3. Independents favored Republican candidates 27-22. These are not the kind of numbers Democrats need to win control of the House or Senate.

A number of questions present themselves to us as a nation, most notably: Where are we going? Off a cliff appears to be the answer for now, but who is going to help us climb back up? What can mitigate these developments except disaster? Over time, will we just swing back and forth between parties with no bipartisan achievements at all? What phoenix will rise from the ashes of our tribal partisanship?

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the United States. It is a worldwide problem, which is another way of extending the question. Germany, France and the Netherlands have one answer, still refusing to yield government control to right-wing populists despite the success of ethonationalist insurgencies in all three countries; Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have another answer — they are all currently swerving to the far right.

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Estimated number of warheads in the nuclear stockpile

Estimated number of warheads in the nuclear stockpile

The United States nuclear arsenal consists of 4,000 warheads, plus more than 2,000 warheads awaiting dismantlement. This number came into focus recently after a report that President Trump said in July that he wanted a huge increase in the country’s nuclear capability.

So, are 4,000 nuclear warheads enough?

In fact, that is far more than the country could ever need. The nuclear stockpile is so large, and its payload so enormous, researchers determined that the United States could kill large parts of the populations of more than a dozen countries using less than half its arsenal.

While the United States has reduced its nuclear stockpile from the peak of 31,255 warheads in 1967, there are still far too many. Even more troubling, Mr. Trump can unilaterally order a nuclear strike at any time. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, has called the president’s threats toward other countries reckless, saying they could set the nation “on the path to World War III.”

Every effort must be made to avoid the use of nuclear weapons. Reducing the nuclear stockpile is one important step. But legislators can go even further by requiring the president to seek a declaration of war from Congress before launching a first nuclear strike, as Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Ted Lieu of California, both Democrats, have proposed.

Below, the U.S. nuclear arsenal – and the devastation it could inflict under the president’s sole discretion

Figures are based on research from the Natural Resources Defense Council and data from Hans Kristensen at the Federation of American Scientists. ""Decimate"" indicates at least a quarter of the population could be killed.

America’s nuclear stockpile expanded under the grim rationale of “mutually assured destruction,” the Cold War-era strategy aimed at deterring countries from using nuclear weapons because they would be annihilated in a counterattack.

Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara defined the strategy as the ability to kill one-quarter of a country’s population in a nuclear attack. The Natural Resources Defense Council used this measure to calculate the nuclear yield required to “decimate” several countries, providing a sense of the payload unleashed in such an attack.

Guaranteeing “mutually assured destruction” would require launching dozens, if not hundreds, of warheads on a target’s densest population centers. The N.R.D.C. calculated such an attack on China would kill 320 million people by targeting 368 population centers around the country – a scenario of such vast carnage, it can scarcely be imagined. Of course, just a single nuclear warhead dropped nearly anywhere on the planet would have devastating consequences.

The group also measured the effects of a similar attack on the United States. In such a scenario, major American population centers, including New York and Los Angeles, would be targeted. The N.R.D.C. estimated it would take 124 warheads, each with a yield of 475 kilotons, to kill one-quarter of the United States population.

Declining Stockpiles

The United States and Russia have always been the biggest nuclear powers by far. They have dismantled tens of thousands of warheads since 1986, when their combined inventory peaked around 70,000. Even so, the combined total still stands around 8,300 warheads and more than 5,000 awaiting dismantlement. The other countries with nuclear weapons – France, China, Britain, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea – altogether have a small fraction of that amount, about 1,100.

In 2013, President Barack Obama proposed that the United States and Russia reduce their deployed nuclear warheads – ones that are available for immediate use – to 1,000 each, one-third fewer than the current target of 1,550 deployed warheads set under their 2010 nuclear arms control treaty. But Moscow balked at negotiations. Other experts have argued that the United States could do with still fewer.

A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: “Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?” The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.","The nomination of an untraditional candidate from outside the party’s mainstream turned the 2016 election into “a stress test for Republican partisanship, and it passed with flying colors,” Theodoridis wrote.

“Republicans identify, at a deep psychological level, more strongly with their party than do Democrats,” according to Theodoridis:

The evidence is rather clear that the modern hyper-polarization is far more characterized by tribal division than by ideological distance. The real story seems to be the growing us-versus-them, in-group/out-group dynamic. If you look at what we call thermometer scores, which have respondents rate their feelings about groups from cold to warm, zero degrees to 100 degrees, the average rating of the other party has dropped from nearly 50 degrees in the early 1980s to temperatures in the 30s today.

Theodoridis summed up the conclusions he and his colleagues reached in a blog post in Scientific American in November 2016:

Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group. Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.

In other words, the assumption that many Republican voters would be repelled by Donald Trump turned out to be wrong; instead party loyalty — “a visceral, even subconscious, attachment” — takes precedence.

In fact, as the political scientists Leonie Huddy, Lilliana Mason and Lene Aarøe argue in an article in American Political Science Review, the most powerful form of partisanship is not principled, ideological commitment to conservative or liberal policies, but “expressive partisanship,” which is more of a gut commitment:

A subjective sense of belonging to a group that is internalized to varying degrees, resulting in individual differences in identity strength, a desire to positively distinguish the group from others, and the development of ingroup bias. Moreover, once identified with a group or, in this instance, a political party, members are motivated to protect and advance the party’s status and electoral dominance as a way to maintain their party’s positive distinctiveness.

Traditionally, political scientists have measured partisanship by asking voters the following questions: “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?” Those who say Republican or Democrat are then asked “Would you call yourself a strong Republican/Democrat or a not very strong Republican/Democrat?” Independents are asked “Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic Party?” Respondents are then ranked on a seven point scale from strong Democrat to strong Republican.

Political scientists measure expressive partisanship by looking at responses to more subjective questions, including “How important is being a Democrat or Republican to you?”, “How well does the term Democrat or Republican describe you?” and “When talking about Democrats or Republicans, how often do you use ‘we’ instead of ‘they’?”

It turns out, according to Huddy, Mason and Aarøe, that those who are strong partisans on the basis of emotional and expressive links to their parties feel angrier

when threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory. In contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats or reassurances.

These expressive partisans also

feel increased schadenfreude, a complex positive emotion, when they read about bad things happening to or reflecting poorly on a political candidate of the other party. They even feel this positive emotion in reaction to events that are clearly negative.

Three other political scientists — Shanto Iyengar, Gaurav Sood and Yphtach Lelkes — reached a similar conclusion in a 2012 paper, “Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization.”

They argue that instead of treating polarization in the general electorate as a conflict over competing policies, the better measure is “affective polarization,” which is their term for the way voters “not only increasingly dislike the opposing party,” but are also willing to “impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.”

Iyengar and his co-authors contend that

affective polarization has permeated judgments about interpersonal relations, exceeds polarization based on other prominent social cleavages, and that levels of partisan affect are significantly higher in America.

In a 2017 paper, “All in the Eye of the Beholder: Asymmetry in Ideological Accountability,” Iyengar and Sood provide further insight into how so many Republicans found their way to voting for Trump.

They demonstrate that partisan voters’ approval of their party’s leaders “bears little relationship with their ideological extremity.” Because of this, candidates like Trump “enjoy considerable leeway to stake out positions at odds with the preferences of their supporters.”

Iyengar and Sood buttress their analysis by pointing out that from December 2008 to August 2010, “Sarah Palin’s support never once slipped below 69% among Republicans,” even though her positions were well to the right of the average Republican voter and she was subjected to brutal ridicule in the liberal media.

The growing strength of the kind of partisanship that is widespread today — whether you call it visceral, expressive, affective or tribal — undermines the workings of democratic governance. Not only are Republicans willing to support Trump, but both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to demonize the leadership of the opposing party.

Iyengar and Sood describe this as the “boomerang effect”:

The position attributed to a disliked party perceived as ideologically distant is pushed even further away from the receiver’s position. For instance, a Democrat who encounters a Republican campaign ad on government spending enlarges the discrepancy between herself and the Republican on the issue.

While attention has focused on Trump and the Republican Party (since both are in power), Democrats are hardly exempt from tribalism.

After Flake denounced Trump on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement making the point that Flake, like Corker, had waited until he was no longer seeking office to break Republican ranks:

Senator Flake voted with Donald Trump 91% of the time. His retirement is a symbol of a Republican Party whose leaders allow Donald Trump’s divisive politics to flourish as long as it serves their political interests, and who fail to criticize this dangerous president until it’s too late.

Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, tweeted: “When Dems attack those GOP pols who stand up to Trump, perhaps they are the ones putting party before country,” a comment picked up by Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, who added, “Yes, this seems to be a case of tribal loyalties coming out at the worst possible time.”

Along similar lines, Theodoridis and Stephen Goggin, a political scientist at San Diego State, asked 1609 voters whether two unnamed senators were Democrats or Republicans. One of the two was described as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Wins Anti-Corruption Award,” the other as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Admits to Lying.” Democrats consistently labeled the anti-corruption senator a Democrat and the liar a Republican, while Republicans took the opposite view.

Perhaps most importantly, hyperpolarization is a powerful disincentive to compromise. How can you make concessions to your mortal enemies? To even start negotiations can be viewed, in this context, as surrender.

Trump’s grip on his party remains firm. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: “Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?” The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.

Trump’s overall favorability ratings may be terrible (39 percent positive to 56 negative), according to a RealClearPolitics average of the eight most recent surveys, but the generic Democratic advantage is a relatively modest 9.2 percentage points. In an October 15-16 Economist/YouGov survey, Democratic voters said they planned to vote for Democratic House candidates 88-3 and Republicans said they would vote for Republican House candidates 86-3. Independents favored Republican candidates 27-22. These are not the kind of numbers Democrats need to win control of the House or Senate.

A number of questions present themselves to us as a nation, most notably: Where are we going? Off a cliff appears to be the answer for now, but who is going to help us climb back up? What can mitigate these developments except disaster? Over time, will we just swing back and forth between parties with no bipartisan achievements at all? What phoenix will rise from the ashes of our tribal partisanship?

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the United States. It is a worldwide problem, which is another way of extending the question. Germany, France and the Netherlands have one answer, still refusing to yield government control to right-wing populists despite the success of ethonationalist insurgencies in all three countries; Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have another answer — they are all currently swerving to the far right.

The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV.
How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that?
A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas.","These days, my mail includes telephone messages wondering why I wore a white blouse to talk about Chuck Hagel getting fired as defense secretary on “Morning Joe,” emails wondering whether I’m wearing the same necklace as the late Gwen Ifill on “Meet the Press” and Facebook messages from family friends purporting to be proud I’m on TV while also offering up commentary that I shouldn’t wear my favorite black leather jacket when talking about Iran’s nuclear program.

But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.

I love my beachwear — these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows. I have eight of them in different colors, all purchased on Folegandros, this island in Greece that I go to every summer, for $15 each. The whole reason I buy them is to cover up my fat arms on TV. Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t.

How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues — do men get such missives? — I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.

Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I’ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.

The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it’s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot’s suits.

In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies — Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump — who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?

Clearly, I’ve decided, Washington can’t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.

“You live in Washington? You will wear these there?” he said, causing me to pause.

I sighed. “Okay, give me the black pair.” I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.

A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas. I had just told her about some blog post that had me in high dudgeon, in which evil bloggers had critiqued the earrings I wore one night on the PBS show “Washington Week.” “There were three tiers to those earrings,” they snarked. “Exactly who costumed Helene? And if this passes for professional dress at The Times these days, color us shocked.”

My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn’t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.

But of course I didn’t.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus. To cancel your entry instead, press Escape.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

其他城市已经提出种种创新方式来保护这些一边走路一边打电话、发短信、听音乐、检查电子邮件，甚至自拍的手机僵尸们。其中包括一些低科技举措，比如加利福尼亚州海沃德市一则激动的标语。（“抬头！过马路。然后再刷Facebook”）；印度孟买设立了禁自拍区；欧洲有了特殊设计的红绿灯，还有一些地方提出了与火奴鲁鲁新法规类似的立法。

上个月，加州圣马特奥县督察委员会一致通过了一项决议，禁止行人过马路时使用手机。这是无法执行的，因为这些问题属州法范畴，但是该措施的提出者戴维·卡内帕(David Canepa)说，这是一个重要的跳板；该决议预计将于明年1月提交加利福尼亚州议会，考虑在全州实施。

卡内帕说，批评者们担心人身自由方面的问题，他们对新想法的适应很慢。“但人们最终会了解它在公共安全方面的价值，”他补充说。“这个立法很实际，而且符合我们的日常认知。它是能救命的法。”

至少有10个州已就行人或骑行人注意力不集中进行了类似的立法辩论；然而根据全美州议会联合会(National Conference of State Legislatures)统计，没有一个州通过类似法案。该联合会表示，相关立法在两个州内尚待表决，9月份，纽约州通过一项法律，要求纽约市研究如何让公众明白，在行走时注意力不集中是有危险的。

Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times 旧金山联合广场一带边走路边发短信的行人。

市级法律是不受追踪的，但是于2011年通过相关法律的艾奥瓦州雷克斯堡可能是最早在全市范围实施禁令的城市。该市一个人口集中地区在很短时期内就有五名行人死亡。对于一个大约只有3.5万名居民的城市来说，这个死亡率相当高 。

雷克斯堡市检察官史蒂芬·佐林格(Stephen Zollinger)说：“这对我们的系统来说是一种震撼。”

人们怀疑行走时注意力不集中是罪魁祸首。除了采取其他安全措施，雷克斯堡还禁止行人在过马路时使用手持装置——除非是正在打电话，佐林格说，“从那以后，我们这里就再也没有行人在交通事故中死亡。”

博德赫拉芬是阿姆斯特丹附近的一个小镇，它尝试了另一种做法。今年，它在一条繁忙的十字路口的人行横道上嵌入了条形LED灯，盯着手机的人过马路时也能看见。当交通信号灯变成红色或绿色时，地面上的灯也会随之变色，还能在马路可以安全通行时提醒行人。

该项目负责人、荷兰交通工程师杜尔夫·卢登堡(Dolf Roodenburg)说，这个试点计划旨在预测趋势，而不是扭转趋势。如果取得成功，该市希望在更多十字路口和自行车道上安装这种LED灯，并将它们提供给其他城市。

在德国的奥格斯堡，去年曾有一个年轻人在横穿电车轨道时使用智能手机，结果被电车撞倒，受了重伤，之后该市也安装了类似的LED灯。

Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times 旧金山某管理公司首席执行官查尔斯·钱·麦西。他说，边走路边使用智能手机这种事“我也会干”。“很多人都这么做；他们知道这是有风险的，可还是这么做了，”他还说。

当然，也有人认为，对行人进行立法约束并不会产生成效。

前纽约市交通运输部(New York City Department of Transportation)部长、现任彭博合伙人公司(Bloomberg Associates)运输主管的珍尼特·萨迪克-汗(Janette Sadik-Khan)表示，立法禁止边走路边发短信不能解决问题，该公司专门向世界各地的市长提供咨询。她说，这样的立法没有任何研究作为依据，设计欠佳，把人们的注意力从道路设计问题和司机行为问题上引开，而这两点才是大多数交通事故的原因。

“这是一个偷懒的办法。进行工程改造更为困难，但效率更高，”萨迪克-汗说。“对于政府来说，建立在可靠分析上的交通安全是一件非常严肃的事情。”",在火奴鲁鲁，过马路时看手机请交35美元,https://cn.nytstyle.com/international/20171025/honolulu-walking-and-texting-fine/

“I decided to place a bind on myself and just do the whole thing in one go within 24 hours,” Mr. Murakami said, “eliminating the process of meticulously designing and going straight to the canvas as if I were drunk.”

Mr. Murakami’s “Dragon in Clouds — Red Mutation” mimics the sweet google-eyed personality and physical dynamism of Shohaku’s dragon and his splashing of pigment against the surface of the paper, so different from Mr. Murakami’s sleek trademark hard-edge forms.

“Takashi has interpreted this in a very expressionistic way that I find tremendously exciting,” said Ms. Morse, who collaborated with Professor Tsuji for over a decade in cataloging the museum’s thousands of objects of Japanese art, including the Shohaku collection. “Takashi sees himself as a spiritual heir following on Shohaku,” she added.

While Mr. Murakami finds his dragon embarrassing technically, he said, “it led me to approach my own limit and begin making this series of massively scaled paintings that without my communication with Professor Tsuji would not have happened.”

Many studies for the painting are shown in Boston.

“That painting I feel is one answer I can give to Professor Tsuji,” said Mr. Murakami, to show him “that I humbly received the ‘Lineage of Eccentrics,’ digested it myself and added something that is completely different from what I received.”

Mr. Tsuji called it a great honor to be a part of this creativity as an art historian. Through the magazine project “which was filled with drama, unpredictability and nonsense,” he said, “I realized Murakami’s genius, rare in an artist, in which he is able to assimilate wide knowledge from others and incorporate it into his works.”

Mr. Murakami’s deep dive into his own Japanese heritage was a way of addressing a kind of identity crisis, said Michael Darling, who organized the artist’s recent retrospective “The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg” at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. “He had reached this apex in his career around 2007, but I think it worried him and made him question why he was making art,” said Mr. Darling, whose exhibition traced the artist’s arc from smooth plasticized figures to mythical beasts and monks rendered craggy and gnarled and at gigantic scale. It was the most highly attended show in the Chicago museum’s history and opens at the Vancouver Art Gallery next year.

“Without saying that Murakami wasn’t interesting before, which I don’t believe,” Mr. Darling added, “I do think that his relationship with Professor Tsuji has had a real noticeable impact on his career and his development.”

The show at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston highlights works directly and generally inspirational to Mr. Murakami. He made an almost one-to-one copy of the conical lotus-shape base supporting a late-10th, early-11th century Buddha in the museum’s collection and used it to prop up his own Buddha interpreted as an animation character in his sculpture “Oval Buddha Silver” (2008). Mr. Murakami’s golden multipanel “Kawaii – vacances (Summer Vacation in the Kingdom of the Golden)” (2008), populated with a field of smiling flower faces, echoes the dazzling ornamentation of poppies on a gold ground in a 17th-century screen by the school of Tawaraya Sotatsu.

In a large-scale work commissioned especially for this show, Mr. Murakami aims to please his teacher. It incorporates the eccentric depiction of natural phenomena, including a direct reference to Shohaku’s screen “Transcendent Attacking a Whirlwind” (circa 1764) where a tornado resembles a serpent’s coiled tail. Speaking while the piece was still in progress, Mr. Murakami confessed that it has been very difficult and he had not yet succeeded.

Finally, after many months of negotiations, he agreed — but only if he’d be granted full artistic license, free from conceptual obligations to church or state.

Occasionally, as he’s been painting, Saurí residents have popped in, offering approving nods, or even prayers.","As a child, the Barcelona-born painter Santi Moix often made weekend trips with his father to Saurí, a remote Catalan village of 16 people perched high in the Pyrenees. Now, at 57, Moix is perhaps the closest thing Saurí has to a local celebrity, having built a career exhibiting work at the Brooklyn Museum and Milan’s M77 Gallery, and at Prada’s SoHo store (a 2013 commission) featuring his abstract, hypersaturated flora and fauna murals.

Five years ago, the local government and bishop asked if the artist might come and paint the interior of St. Victor, the village’s 1,100-year-old Romanesque church, whose plain stone walls had become dull and decrepit over time. Moix, who isn’t religious, was reluctant. Finally, after many months of negotiations, he agreed — but only if he’d be granted full artistic license, free from conceptual obligations to church or state. “I was clear that I would not paint saints or martyrs,” he says.

What he ended up producing is his largest piece to date, some 1,200 square feet of frescoes that cover most of the church, which he describes as a “huge garden full of fantasy.” This new Eden — painstakingly mapped out in his Brooklyn studio — abounds with psychedelic daisies, spotted salamanders, beasts with tentacles and copulating sheep, all rendered in cloudlike swaths of grass green, cornflower yellow and strawberry pink. After assistants sanded and plastered St. Victor’s walls (and covered up some mediocre art), Moix spent three years in Saurí, off and on, painting these scenes directly onto the building’s surfaces for up to 15 hours a day using handmade boar-bristle brushes and organic pigments diluted with water. “Like human skin and tattoos,” he says, “the colors will continue to absorb for months to come.”

The motifs that appear in this Fauvist natural world are central to Moix’s work, though he says that what he found more inspiring was the opportunity to strip a place of worship of its religious iconography. (St. Victor, which has welcomed parishioners continuously since its founding in the ninth century, closed during the transformation, but will open again this month.) “Churches used to strike fear with images of demons and fire,” Moix says. “I loved the idea of overwhelming with colors instead.” The Catalan government and the diocese that hired him agree; its members conceived of this residency — which will expand to pair other regional artists with neglected Catholic properties — as a way of replacing the once-vibrant biblical paintings that had filled hundreds of churches in the region before they were sold or stolen.

In painting St. Victor, Moix was joining a storied tradition: The Catholic Church is, of course, responsible for much of the Christian world’s greatest artistic endeavors. But he is also part of a more recent movement, one that sees contemporary artists remaking religious spaces. Earlier this year, the American painter Julie Mehretu converted an out-of-use Harlem church into a soaring studio where she made giant, 32-foot-wide paintings (now on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and occasionally hosted visitors. The U.K.-based sculptor Gareth Neal and the designer Chris Eckersley recently reskinned one London church, and Neal will hold a solo show in another this March. And this winter, a space inspired by Romanesque chapels that was designed by the late Ellsworth Kelly will be unveiled at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Tex.

It’s easy to dismiss these projects as opportunistic, a way of claiming magnificent buildings that have been left behind in increasingly godless times in service of the art world’s love of larger-than-life spectacle. But Moix sees the commission as a way to revive a region — one currently fraught with conflict — that he once called home. “I want to give something to the locals that they can be proud of,” he says. Occasionally, as he’s been painting, Saurí residents have popped in, offering approving nods, or even prayers. In those moments, Moix just lets them be.","In Catalonia, a Church Becomes a Place of Artistic Pilgrimage",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/t-magazine/santi-moix-catalonia-st-victor-church.html

In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.
They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.
Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.
Still, she says, “I think it is a very good idea for the sake of the brain to be moving and active.”","Last year, in an important study published in NeuroImage, the researchers found for the first time that young brain cells in adult mice that spent a month with running wheels in their cages did seem to be different from those in animals that did not run. For the experiment, the scientists injected a modified rabies vaccine into the animals, where it entered the nervous system and brain. They then tracked and labeled connections between brain cells and learned that compared to the sedentary animals’ brain cells, the runners’ newborn neurons had more and longer dendrites, the snaky tendrils that help to connect the cells into the neural communications network. They also found that more of these connections led to portions of the brain that are important for spatial memory, which is our internal map of where we have been and how we got there.

This type of memory is often diminished in the early stages of dementia.

But these findings, while intriguing, involved animals that had been running for a month, which is the equivalent of years of physical activity by people. The researchers wondered whether such changes in neurons and connections might actually begin earlier and maybe almost immediately after the animals began to exercise.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Scientific Reports, most of the same researchers gathered a group of adult, male mice. (Males were used to avoid accounting for the effects of the female reproductive cycle.) The animals were injected with a substance that marks newborn neurons. Half were then allowed to run for a week on wheels in their cages, while the others remained inactive. Afterward, some were also injected with the modified rabies vaccine to track new synapses and connections between the neurons.

When the scientists then microscopically examined brain tissue, they found that the runners’ brains, as expected, teemed with far more new neurons than did the brains of the sedentary animals, even though the runners had been exercising for only a week.

Interestingly, these neurons also looked unique. They were larger and, as in the study of mice that ran for a month, displayed more and longer dendrites than similar neurons in the other animals. In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.

These young cells were better integrated into the overall brain circuitry, too, with more connections into portions of the brain involved in spatial and other types of memory. Most surprising to the scientists, these cells also proved to be less easily activated by neurochemical messages to fire rapidly, which is usually a hallmark of more mature neurons. They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.

What these differences in cell structure and connection mean for brain function remains uncertain, though, says Henriette van Praag, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health and senior author of this and the earlier study. Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.

But the current study “provides more pieces of evidence that brain cells produced under running conditions are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different” than other neurons, she says, “and these differences are evident very soon” after exercise begins.

Perhaps most important, the new brain cells in the runners tended to integrate into and bulk up portions of the brain that, if damaged by disease, are associated with early memory loss and dementia, she adds.

Of course, this experiment used mice, which are not people. While some past neurological studies with people have hinted that exercise might alter our brain structure in similar ways, she says, that possibility is still theoretical.

The administration of Donald Trump has shown no interest in draining the real swamp that is drowning America’s economy and corrupting its politics.","In the financial sector, a web of regulatory subsidies sustains financial institutions’ unhealthy reliance on extremely high levels of debt. These subsidies, including policies that strongly encourage mortgage securitization as well as the implicit promise to bail out “too big to fail” institutions, swell profits in the near term while increasing the systemic risk of a catastrophic meltdown in the long run. The result is a financial sector much bigger than the economy needs, chronic misallocation of capital and the diversion of some of the country’s top talent into counterproductive work. Luring people into excessive debt, draining their savings with hidden fees, inflating the next asset bubble — these and other dubious “contributions” by finance to the economy need to be curtailed.

Intellectual property laws are supposed to encourage innovation by granting temporary monopolies to copyright and patent holders. But if those monopolies get too broad and too onerous, innovation takes a hit — and that is precisely what has happened, at the urging and for the benefit of Hollywood, Big Pharma and some interests in Silicon Valley.

Occupational licensing rules at the state level help explain why professionals in the United States are paid so much more than their peers in other countries. Primary care physicians, for example, make 50 percent more in the United States than in other advanced countries, and specialists do even better. State regulations protect the incomes of doctors, dentists, undertakers and optometrists — not to mention makeup artists and auctioneers — while also stifling innovation.

Increasingly severe constraints on building in high-income coastal cities inflate the asset values of affluent homeowners, contributing significantly to rising disparities in wealth. And by making housing unaffordable, they prevent the less well-off from moving to where the good-paying jobs are, reducing geographic and social mobility.

This regressive regulatory swamp isn’t a natural landscape; it grows because of forces in our political environment. The beneficiaries of upward redistribution are always far more organized than those who pay the costs. They can divert some of their artificially high profits into lobbying and policy research that bestow a patina of the public interest on schemes that are, in practice, legalized robbery. Drugmakers, for example, portray even the most modest retrenchment of patent law as catastrophic for American innovation, while financiers warn that any restraint on subsidized risk-taking (through higher capital requirements, for example) will starve American industry of the capital it needs to invest and grow.

This unequal battle for the minds of policymakers is particularly damaging at a time when the resources that Congress and the bureaucracy have for independent research have been systematically dismantled. In finance, in particular, Congress has a difficult time hiring and retaining staff with the technical knowledge and experience to assess the impact of new regulations, leaving them dependent on the abundant resources of the industry itself.

In addition, many regressive regulations are made in obscure places with limited participation, such as state licensing boards and town councils in charge of approving new housing. Insiders with narrow interests, whether self-serving professional groups or Nimby neighbors, have the motivation and resources to show up at poorly attended meetings and work the system, often at odds with the general public’s interest in low prices and economic opportunity.

Really draining the swamp means changing the policymaking process to shield it against insider takeover and manipulation. For starters, congressional staffs need to be expanded, upgraded and professionalized. Legislators would then be better able to make their own assessments of complex regulatory issues without having to depend on the biased expertise of industry lobbyists.

Philanthropists need to put their dollars behind a network of organizations to counter the organizational presence of the forces of upward redistribution. The Ford Foundation did this in the 1970s by investing in a network of environmental law firms like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund. More recently, the Eli and Edythe Broad, Walton Family, Robertson and other charitable foundations have made similar investments in educational reforms.

Whatever you think of the merits of these causes, the new interest groups funded by sustained philanthropy changed the political landscape in these issue areas, forcing policymakers to recognize that there were, in fact, two sides to be considered. A network of new organizations with the resources and expertise to compete with big banks, the medical lobby and other industry groups could have a similar impact today. Activist groups could show up regularly in all the obscure places where rules are set and make sure that someone speaks up for the public interest.

State and local governments need to institute regulatory review procedures that expose back-room deals to objective scrutiny. While cost-benefit analysis by the Office of Management and Budget is standard for new federal regulations, no such reviews are conducted when states propose to license new occupations or cities stymie new housing construction.

Courts at all levels need to be less deferential to regulatory schemes that — in contrast to environmental or labor regulation — have no justification other than the protection of incumbent interests. For example, courts could force legislatures to explicitly approve expansions in the scope of occupational licensing, depriving licensing boards of the power to do so in shadowy obscurity.

In the political arena, the issues of regressive regulation cut across the usual partisan and ideological battle lines, and so tend to be kept off the agenda by legislative leaders who emphasize issues that hold their caucus together. Libertarian-leaning conservatives and egalitarian liberals need to forge strange-bedfellows coalitions to tackle policies that are simultaneously bad for growth and inequality. In recent years, cross-party coalitions in the states have started to make progress on criminal justice reform. Opposition to upward redistribution can galvanize support for similar alliances on regulatory issues.

The administration of Donald Trump has shown no interest in draining the real swamp that is drowning America’s economy and corrupting its politics. If public-spirited Democrats and Republicans fail to do so, trust in democracy will continue to erode. And the next demagogue who cashes in by saying he alone can fix things is likely to be more disciplined and focused than Mr. Trump — and hence even more dangerous.",Trump Made the Swamp Worse.

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”So, pass the matches.","Of course, this is a post-“Da Vinci Code” world in which no thriller can turn up with a single, white male expert (prone to the odd quip while staring down the end of civilization) without recalling Robert Langdon, he of the black turtlenecks and the knack for symbols. Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.

We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation’s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin — and the reader — have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel’s narrative like one of Trent Reznor’s dark guitar chords: “Wasn’t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.”

“We can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.”

“Instead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.”

A description of Google’s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: “It was insinuated in every facet of people’s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.” From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there’s nothing to be done about it. It’s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don’t even know that we’re sick.

“I can’t tell which is the immune system anymore and which the disease — whether we’re defending or attacking ourselves,” Jackie, a Google employee whom Martin long ago rescued from death, admits.

He might have been talking about the comments section on HuffPost.

A similar widespread villainy lies at the heart of David Ignatius’s THE QUANTUM SPY (Norton, $25.95), a somber espionage procedural about the race to build the world’s first quantum computer — a theoretical frontier at the intersection of computer science and quantum physics. Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist who has long covered the C.I.A., and he happily takes us for a jaunt through a world of anonymous hotel rooms and conference tables across Beijing and Vancouver and Dubai, where decisions to take someone off “the shelf” (i.e., bring him or her back into action) are blankly relayed and executed. American start-ups on the brink of game-changing innovation are visited by a C.I.A. officer, a “lean, putty-faced man with a bad haircut” who quietly demands for the United States government to be their only client. Operatives aspire to the “highest art” of their profession: to “appear ordinary.”

Here, the ostensible enemy is a mole inside the C.I.A. known as Rukou, or the Doorway, whom the C.I.A. must ferret out and eliminate, all the while keeping the Chinese away from their technological breakthroughs — a Sisyphean exercise if ever there was one.

The mood is mournful and restrained. The C.I.A.’s vibe feels like a highway motel with thin walls, a smell of chlorine, a vending machine where your Twix gets stuck on the glass. The most delightful aspect of the book is the characterization of the Chinese — their expletive-ridden insults, downbeat perspective (“Bad luck is always hiding inside the doorway, down the next hutong”), and quirks. Chinese agents carry a mijian with them at all times, “a small, leatherbound diary” in which they write things “that were never, ever to be shared.” In one fascinating scene set in Mexico, a Chinese agent with a Spanish accent unnerves the Chinese-American hero, Harris Chang, by unveiling Chang’s own secret political Chinese ancestry to him. It proves to be a surprisingly powerful interrogation technique: “He was uncomfortable. It was as if someone else had taken possession of his life story.”

It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build “one world” — a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook’s hope to “bring the world closer together.” But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang’s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: “He occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.” The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.

In Michelle Richmond’s THE MARRIAGE PACT (Bantam, $27), a different kind of evil is in play, this one just as intangible and pernicious. Giddy and in love, two Bay Area newlyweds, Alice and Jake, receive a Molotov cocktail of a wedding present: an invitation to join “The Pact,” a hush-hush society-cum-cult, the details of which are pitched to them “Glengarry Glen Ross”-style by Vivian, a beautiful woman in a yellow dress with a politician’s pivot and spin.

The Pact is a “fellowship of like-minded individuals” dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is “highly effective, scientifically based.” Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.

Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an “impenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.” But Alice and Jake — apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, “Shoot first and ask questions later” — agree to Vivian’s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with “an impressively large stack of profiteroles,” where they chat with women who say things like: “Stupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.”

Jake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: “I would’ve stopped it, Jake. I could’ve saved you. Now it’s too late.”

It’s a fun, can’t-stop-eating-the-potato-chips kind of premise. Jake — a marriage counselor who has little insight into his own relationships — descends into a labyrinth of paranoia and isolation as he investigates the truth behind The Pact, all the while lying to his wife and enduring one level of punishment after the next. (Apparently, when it comes to marital harmony, de Sade was really on to something.) The book is at its strongest when Richmond describes The Pact’s manual in a wickedly deadpan style. It sounds like something between a tutorial for new guards on Rikers Island and MarriageTM by the Mad Hatter: “Failure to provide three or more gifts in a single calendar year should be treated as a Class 5 Felony.” Then there is the Focus Mechanism, one of a range of contraptions designed to help you stay attentive to your significant other (QVC, take note): “The collar circles her neck, extending all the way up to her jawline, where it cups her chin.”

As Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.

In Christopher Swann’s first novel, SHADOW OF THE LIONS (Algonquin, $26.95), we are whisked into another type of cult: Blackburne, an elite all-boys private school in the Virginia countryside, rife with its own odd rituals and unspoken understandings. “A warning shake of the head meant Watch out.” “Cutting your eyes away from a classmate you passed in the hall could be as cruel as sneering in his face.”

Our protagonist is Matthias Glass — a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York’s literary scene with a “long-legged, pouty” model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods — and “off the edge of the earth.” He was never seen again.

Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class “in a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.” Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing — the desire to “conquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,” or how being labeled gay constituted “the worst, most devastating blow” that left the accused “cast into the outer darkness.”

Blackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet’s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: “Doubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.” It’s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.

Danya Kukafka’s bewitching first novel, GIRL IN SNOW (Simon & Schuster, $26), spins a spell of mournful confession around a “Twin Peaks”-like centerpiece, the beautiful girl found dead: “Lucinda Hayes broke her neck. Cracked it on the edge of the carousel.” The truth is revealed through the claustrophobic confessions of three misfits, observations Kukafka gently takes out and holds up to the light as if sifting through a refuse-filled gutter after a rain. There is Russ, the restrained police officer investigating Lucinda’s murder; Jade, a resentful fellow classmate who makes sense of people and events by stuffing them into the skeletal format of a screenplay; and Cameron, the obsessive loner who stalked Lucinda: “Cameron had started playing Statue Nights when he was 12 years old.” In Kukafka’s capable hands, villainy turns out to be everywhere and nowhere, a DNA that could be found under the fingernails of everybody’s hands.

In THE MURDERS OF MOLLY SOUTHBOURNE (Tor/Forge, paper, $11.99), a scold’s bridle of a coming-of-age tale by Tade Thompson, we meet the protagonist of the title agonizing in her “universe defined by pain.” Every time Molly bleeds, the blood gives birth to a dimwitted, monstrous version of herself, a ghoulish other “molly” who, after a period of incubation, blasts out of doors and from under the bed, bloodthirsty and dangerous. Molly must kill these doppelgängers before they kill her. And thus unspools a horrifying childhood. She learns to murder and dispose of human flesh with the precision of a Tarantino fixer (“When her parents arrive she is lying on a pile of corpses she’d been trying to clean”), all the while enjoying the ABCs of adolescence: first kisses, running away from home, Rudyard Kipling.

The most compelling aspects of the book are not just Thompson’s dagger prose (“In these teenage years she kills three mollys a week, sometimes as many as one a day”), but also the blunt paragraphs and truncated chapters through which he reveals Molly’s reality. It has the effect of a slide show in Art History 101. In darkness, we are shown a series of close-ups: gnarled hand, decapitated head, a foot, some blood, fragments that make little sense until the final portrait is revealed. It’s as unsettling as one of Francis Bacon’s screaming popes, or the Lucian Freud painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping”: a bold outpouring of flesh and crisis at once horrifying and familiar.

Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.

The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily — slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted détente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.

We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it’s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn’t good. It seems these days we’re not only uncertain of everything and everyone — foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads — we’re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”

And here is Lear, in like-minded obstinacy, when Kent, his loyal courtier, pleads with him to rethink what he has done in relinquishing his kingdom to two grasping and sycophantic daughters while disinheriting the true-hearted third:

What? Preposterous, outrageous! Who dares to juxtapose Shakespearean verse with 21st-century vernacular? But take note: sameness rules nevertheless. Wilson is truly Kent, Kent is plainly Wilson. Kent is exiled, Wilson is fired, or, as we like to say, let go. Shakespearean language aside, this seductive Hogarthian mandate — Lear retold in familiar idiom — appears to be fulfilled, alchemized into the topical. And yes, language is here justly set aside; we are right to be indifferent to the sublime. Dunbar’s tone, pedestrian even in anger, is of our time; it is ours, it is us. “Dunbar,” not unlike the play itself, turns out to be a thriller: a crime thriller, a corporate mega-mogul thriller and even, at least in one horrific scene, a sadistic thriller. Betrayals are betrayed, boardroom machinations proliferate, monstrous conspiracies beget more monstrousness.

Still, a cutting-edge cutthroat novel cannot be merely an acquiescent doppelgänger. For the sake of narrative speed and cinematic concision, it is compelled to jettison superfluous characters and an entire parallel story line: that of Gloucester, yet another father of wicked and favorable offspring. We can anyhow recognize who is derived from whom, plucked from one thread of Lear’s predicament to serve another of Dunbar’s. Dr. Bob, for instance, Abigail and Megan’s willing confederate and the slavelike sexual partner of both sisters, stands in for Edmund, Gloucester’s scheming bastard son; like Edmund, the doctor is secretly plotting usurpation. And among the most recognizable spinoffs is Peter, Dunbar’s soused and mercurial sidekick, a feeble echo of Lear’s Fool. Having engineered their escape from the drugs and rigors of Nurse Roberts, cowardly Peter abandons his muddled friend in wintry Cumbria, the isolated lake district of northwestern England — Lear’s wild and storm-ridden heath.

And now Dunbar, alone and lost and on the loose, must be pursued and again imprisoned, lest he somehow blunder his way toward undermining the crucial meeting that will determine the Dunbar empire’s ultimate disposition. A takeover by a rival media conglomerate is an alarming possibility. To forestall so catastrophic an outcome, the miscreant sisters, already stymied by a tangle of treacheries, must prevent their distraught and remorseful father’s meddling. But first, to learn of Dunbar’s whereabouts, they will lure and torture Peter. Abigail will try to burn him alive, even as Dr. Bob looks on.

So much for the thriller’s bursts of action, shock, suspense, unmitigated evil, blood-soaked reversals and the inevitable chase. Story! But in reconceiving Shakespeare, it isn’t story that counts; the meaning of story is all. And it is through the Fool that it comes clear why plot, however resourcefully reconstituted, is, after all, the least of it.

Peter is an antic fellow, a drunken callow clown with a knack for celebrity impersonation — a buffoon who becomes an easy victim. Though comic buffoons and yokels are scattered through a number of Shakespeare’s tragedies, Lear’s universe is relentlessly bleak, and the Fool, despite his jingling, is neither oaf nor jester. He is sometimes compared to a Greek chorus, that droning moan of dooming fatalism; but he is larger than this. His crooked prophetic cry is nearer at heart to the majestic voice of Job’s God: he knows what he knows, and if fear, lust, rage, greed, deceit, domination, revulsion, hurt — all the dire passions — are portioned among the play’s dramatis personae, only the Fool can weigh these all at once and put them in their puny place. Only the Fool can see the pity of it, and see it whole. And what is the meaning of this chronicle of a power-stripped maddened old king and the brutes who humble him, if not pity?

With one exception, “Dunbar” — like the genre novel it mostly resembles — keeps the story and loses the meaning. The exception is the long central passage where, as Dunbar wanders half-hallucinating in the Cumbrian wilderness, the only dialogue is between the mind and itself. A heartbreaking scrim of the broken and unspoken, image upon image, flames up:

“The broken layer of brown and purple cloud scattered in the yellowing sky reminded him of his mother’s tortoiseshell comb when he used to close one eye and hold it up to the lamplight and stare at it for ages, until its mottled pattern of light and dark patches filled the whole visual field.… The hills, drenched by the storm, were gleaming and dripping in the afternoon light. How tactless of him to have insisted on bringing his lumbering body to this lovely, liquid scene, to dump it like a sack of cement, split open and hardened by rain, on this otherwise uncontaminated hillside.… The next thing that happened was that he forgot the last thing that happened.”

Here we can feel the writer feeling, and with Lawrentian clarity: a distillation of harrowed human pity. Retelling becomes reliving, a fleeting wisp of Shakespeare’s elusive breath. All the rest, in the usual way of thriller fiction, is puppetry and plot.",King Lear Is Reborn as a 21st-Century Media Mogul,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/books/review/edward-st-aubyn-dunbar-king-lear.html

MANY OF US, let’s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that’s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev’s apartment is certainly photogenic — he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed — but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom — “it’s not like a website where you go and see pictures,” he says. “It’s honest.”

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html

They outlined Mr. Trump’s announcement on condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting his formal speech.

The president in August called the opioid crisis a “national emergency.” But he did not sign a formal declaration designating it as such, allowing the prospect to languish amid resistance in his administration about making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with a crisis that has shown no signs of abating. The crisis has claimed tens of thousands of lives — a death rate that one administration official noted Thursday rivals the number of Americans killed during the Vietnam War.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is not clear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out, including a drug czar to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of Health and Human Services who would tailor policies and identify funding streams.

Representative Tom Marino, the Pennsylvania Republican whom Mr. Trump had named to head his Office of National Drug Control Policy, withdrew last week after reports that he did the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in weakening law enforcement’s ability to curb drug sales in efforts to block black-market sales of opioids. The White House has yet to announce a new candidate.

And Tom Price resigned last month as health secretary after it was revealed he was flying on private jets paid for with taxpayer dollars; a nominee has not been named for that post either.

But proponents, including some anti-addiction groups and physicians, argue Mr. Trump’s action is an important symbolic step that would raise awareness and spark a new sense of urgency to deal with the opioid scourge.

The administration officials said a public health emergency declaration would quickly lead to crucial changes, including the potential to secure federal grant money and the expansion of access to telemedicine services, which would broaden the reach of medical treatment to rural areas ravaged by opioid use and where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump’s promises to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year.

As president, he formed an opioid commission in March and installed at the helm Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race. In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have prompted the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump has chosen.

Mr. Price had ruled out the idea of a national emergency, in part because of concerns about the potentially exorbitant costs to the federal government. Still, Mr. Trump surprised his advisers by telling reporters soon after his commission’s report that he was ready to take just such a step.

There have been few major actions to match those words, even as administration officials have worked feverishly behind the scenes to come to agreement on an opioid policy that would reflect the president’s position.

In the meantime, members of Mr. Trump’s opioid commission and lawmakers in both parties had grown impatient for action. On Wednesday, a group of Democrats led by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan released a letter they wrote to the president asking him to allow the government to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Declaring a state of emergency would give the secretary of Health and Human Services the power to seek such price reductions, they said.

Mr. Christie commended the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.",Trump to Declare Opioid Crisis a ‘Public Health Emergency’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value.
How much a policy will fetch depends on its face value and premiums (settlement companies buy whole life, universal life, term insurance or hybrids), as well as on your life expectancy.
The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy.
Life settlement still looks somewhat tricky to navigate, but it’s an option to keep in mind.","If a life-settlement company likes its odds of turning a profit, it will buy the policy, paying out more than the policy’s cash value — the amount received if the policy were canceled — but less than the face value, or death benefit.

The firm acquires the policy and continues paying the premiums. Then the company (or a big investor who buys bundles of policies) collects when the seller dies. It’s something like a reverse mortgage, but on your life instead of your house.

“There are so many seniors sitting on these assets, and they’re throwing them away,” said Chris Orestis, executive vice president of GWG Life, who points out that most Americans simply let policies lapse.

For now, life settlement remains a seldom-used option. About 1,650 Americans received settlements for their policies last year, according to statistics compiled annually by journalist Donna Horowitz for The Deal, a financial publication.

But the industry, which previously targeted the very affluent, has begun courting middle-class people who own policies with face values of $100,000 to $500,000. Moreover, in a business once heavily reliant on brokers as intermediaries, several companies now market directly to consumers — like Coventry, the largest life-settlement provider, which runs national TV ads.

GWG Life works with nursing homes and assisted living chains to reach people contemplating the daunting costs of long-term care. The policyholder can set up an irrevocable bank account to funnel the proceeds of the sale directly to a care provider.

The company’s strategy, as articulated by Mr. Orestis: “When a family walks into a community and says, ‘Jeez, we can’t afford this,’ everyone in the long-term care industry should say, ‘Do you have a life insurance policy?’”

Odds are, then, that you’ll be hearing more about this possibility. A business that began with so-called viatical settlements at the height of the AIDS epidemic is now coming after older adults.

Sometimes, selling makes sense. Older people may no longer need life insurance bought to protect a spouse who has since died or children who have reached financial independence. Perhaps rising premiums have become a financial struggle or other needs have grown more pressing.

At that point, most policyholders just stop paying premiums. They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value. In any event, the insurer never pays a death benefit, an advantage the insurance industry has come to rely on.

“Insurance companies make money when people give up their policies,” said Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has written about life settlement. “Now the life-settlement guys are coming in and offering better deals.”

Why sell a policy for a fraction of what it would bring your heirs? One Texan who sold his policy to Abacus took his family on an around-the-world cruise, Mr. Jackson said. But most use life settlements not for luxuries or fantasies, but for medical treatment or living expenses.

How much a policy will fetch depends on its face value and premiums (settlement companies buy whole life, universal life, term insurance or hybrids), as well as on your life expectancy. That explains Mr. Jackson’s questions about my health.

The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy. To get an attractive price when you want to unload that policy years later, it helps to be old and sick.

Life-settlement companies and their investors don’t want to hold onto your policy, paying the premiums, for more than seven to 10 years. “The longer your life expectancy, the lower your offer,” Ms. Horowitz said.

But if your policy looks profitable, a life settlement typically amounts to 20 to 30 percent of its death benefit. That may represent a better deal than simply surrendering a policy, but it isn’t necessarily smarter than keeping it in force.

If you need money immediately and have a policy with cash value, you can borrow against it. If high premiums have become problematic, your beneficiaries might want to take over the payments to receive the face value upon your death.

Moreover, while a death benefit flows to your beneficiaries tax-free, life-settlement proceeds are taxable, to the extent they exceed what you have paid in premiums. And owning or selling the policy could stall or complicate the process of qualifying for Medicaid.

Then there’s the question of how much a broker, who submits your information to several life-settlement companies, will take in commission — generally 20 to 30 percent of the price a company offers.

You could avoid that by approaching several settlement companies directly, going through interviews, supplying documentation and then comparing offers. But some policyholders will appreciate having someone shepherd them through the process, especially given the industry’s somewhat dodgy past.

Sellers found it hard to ascertain whether they were receiving a fair price, for instance, and how much of it a broker was pocketing, the federal Government Accountability Office reported in 2010.

In response, 43 states have adopted life-settlement regulations, usually requiring that companies be licensed and make consumer disclosures. “The industry cleaned itself up a lot,” Dr. Smetters said. “But caution is appropriate.”

State regulations differ, and it still requires legwork and fine-print reading to know how much you’ll walk away with and to determine what’s in your interest.

“You have to really understand the contract you’re signing,” Dr. Smetters said. “If I were doing this, I’d try to find out who the major companies are and call myself. But I’d also sit down with a fee-only financial adviser experienced in this area and do the analytics. Is this a good deal?”

So, caution advised. But simply walking away, surrendering a policy you’ve already paid a lot for, rarely represents the best option.

“If my policy is worth $100,000 the day I die, is it worth nothing the day before?” said Darwin Bayston, chief executive of the Life Insurance Settlement Association, a trade group. “The answer is no.”

After Mr. Jackson and I finished the interview, he cheerfully informed me, “There’s almost no probability we’d buy your policy.” My life expectancy, according to Abacus models, is another 280 months, or 23-plus years.

No life-settlement provider or investor wants to hold onto a policy and pay premiums for that long before seeing a payoff.

The premiums on my whole-life policy are low and won’t increase. So I’ll keep writing semiannual checks for now, hoping my family will pocket the death benefit.

Even as it faced new scrutiny in Europe, Volkswagen moved a step closer to putting the emissions scandal behind it in the United States, as the automaker received approval from federal and California regulators for its proposed repairs to reduce harmful emissions from 38,000 diesel-powered sport utility vehicles.

The approval, issued jointly on Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board and disclosed Monday, will spare Volkswagen from the expense of buying back the affected models.

That settlement was part of about $25 billion in fines and other costs that Volkswagen has agreed to pay to address claims brought by consumers, regulators and states in connection with the company’s scheme to evade federal emissions rules with so-called defeat devices in diesel vehicles.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

Over the past few decades, our political culture has corroded. Traditions of compromise and civility have given way to a zero-sum, winner-take-all approach that is now out of control. As Mr. Flake said on the Senate floor Tuesday, “Anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.”

Unfortunately, Jeff Flake is only the latest example of a Republican whose willingness to speak out against his party’s current standard-bearer has cost him politically.

The president has spent weeks impugning Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for pointing out that Mr. Trump is “debasing” the nation. Mr. Trump, as a candidate and as president, has also repeatedly and viciously attacked Senator John McCain, a war hero who has sacrificed more for the United States than most of us can even imagine.

Republican leaders have offered occasional defenses of their colleagues from these attacks: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called Mr. Flake “a very fine man” of “high principles” on Tuesday. But they have largely remained on the sidelines as Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked those few Republicans who have dared to call for civility and compromise.

The consequences of this could be grave.

If the Republican Party under Donald Trump has no room for independent-minded conservatives, and if, in the coming years, senators like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are replaced by fringe conservatives handpicked because of their blind loyalty to this president, it will be too late for responsible conservatives to salvage the party they’ve built over generations.

As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m particularly worried by the prospect of Mr. Trump’s narrow, nationalist “America First” foreign policy replacing the vision of lawmakers like Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake who have pushed for strong American global leadership based on human rights, the rule of law and strong international agreements. I sincerely hope that Republican leaders recognize this before it’s too late.

As for Democrats, there should be no sense of satisfaction in what is happening to the Republican Party. The balance of two functioning political parties has been essential to our country’s success. In fact, we should take this moment to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: How much do our own party’s internal battles resemble the fight happening within the Republican Party? As Democrats call for independence and pragmatism from Republicans, we should be asking ourselves how tolerant we are of dissent within our own party and how much we are really willing to reach across the aisle.

Senator Flake finished his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday by quoting Abraham Lincoln, who reminded Americans on the eve of the Civil War that “we are not enemies, but friends” and “though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” Mr. Flake wisely warned Republicans and Democrats that our bonds are dangerously strained. Now is the time to ensure they don’t break.

Major leaguers combined for a record 6,105 homers in 2017, and the postseason has been no different. The very first batter, Minnesota’s Brian Dozier, went deep to start the first wild-card game. In their National League Championship Series loss to the Dodgers, the Chicago Cubs scored eight runs on homers, and no runs any other way. Of the 17 runs scored in this World Series, 14 have come on homers.

“Everybody’s swinging for the fences,” said a weary Ken Giles, the Astros’ closer, who served up Yasiel Puig’s 10th-inning blast in Game 2. “Home runs this series have been the big play so far. We need to figure out a way to prevent it.”

On Friday, the series shifts to Minute Maid Park, where the Astros are 6-0 this postseason. Jose Altuve began the Astros’ playoff run with three homers there in the division series opener. The Dodgers also got a three-homer game in the playoffs, by Enrique Hernandez in the N.L.C.S. clincher.

Teams generally must slug to win. The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the playoffs this season; the Astros were first, at .478, and the Dodgers were tied for seventh with the Cubs, at .437. If this World Series becomes one big home run derby, the Astros like their chances.

“If it comes down to a slugfest, my money’s on us,” third baseman Alex Bregman said. “We bang. We’re the best-hitting team in baseball. We’ll step in that box ready to go every time. It’s fun to be a part of an offense like this.”

Bregman homered off Clayton Kershaw in Game 1, the only blemish across Kershaw’s seven dazzling innings. It was typical of the way opponents have tried to handle Kershaw this month: with little chance of bunching hits together, they simply try to swing big.

The strategy is failing; while Kershaw has allowed all eight of his runs on homers this postseason, he is 3-0 with a 2.96 earned run average. He is scheduled to face Keuchel in Game 5 on Sunday.

As for Keuchel’s assertion — widely shared by other pitchers around the league — that the balls have been altered, Commissioner Rob Manfred has consistently denied it. He reiterated that stance before the American League wild-card game this month.

“We’re using two different labs that have been looking at the ball on a continuous basis all year,” Manfred said. “Balls are within specs; there’s been no movement even within the range of the specifications in terms of the baseball. I’ve said before I think there’s other issues causing the home runs other than the baseball — principally, the way the game’s being played, the tolerance for strikeouts, power pitching, guys changing their swing.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

Manfred added that “fans like home runs,” a point that is hard to argue. Excitement surged through Dodger Stadium with each home run on Wednesday night, and the hitters reacted memorably: The Dodgers’ Joc Pederson joyously gestured to the crowd; Carlos Correa gleefully flipped his bat toward the Astros’ dugout; Puig gently placed his bat on the dirt; Charlie Culberson cavorted as if he were Joe Carter.

“Guys have been superaggressive, trying to get a fastball or attack a first pitch — that’s what I’ve been seeing,” said the Astros’ Chris Devenski, who gave up Culberson’s two-out homer in the 11th but struck out Puig with a changeup to end it. “It’s baseball. It goes in streaks; it goes in spurts at times.”

The last time the World Series came to Southern California, in 2002, home runs were also the big story. The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in Game 2 in Anaheim, 11-10, with the teams combining for six home runs, out of a record 21 for the Series. Players openly guessed that the ball was juiced then, too.

Al Levine, a nonroster pitcher for the Angels, actually took a Ginsu knife and sliced open a World Series ball and a regular-season ball in the clubhouse during that game. He concluded that the World Series ball was wound tighter.

“When I cut them open, one was easier, definitely,” Levine said then. “The World Series ball was a lot tougher to get through.”

Troy Percival, the Angels closer who had given up a towering homer to Barry Bonds, put it this way: “It’s like throwing a smooth rock.”

Predictably, baseball denied any shenanigans. By then, though, the owners and the players had agreed to implement steroid testing the next season. The program has gradually gotten tougher since then, including a provision that players suspended during the regular season cannot take part in the postseason.

We have been fooled before, of course, but this generation of players seems to want a clean game. A widespread, coordinated cheating epidemic that consistently beats baseball’s testing program seems a little hard to fathom.

In any case, this World Series has so far reflected the game in 2017: dinger after dinger after dinger, breaking records and turning most players into awe-struck fans.

He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

These networks are mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing data. By looking for patterns in millions of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog. This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.

By 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

“Of course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,” Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. “It takes many years to train a Ph.D.”",Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

Last winter, Mr. Pangilinan was tempted by a large one-bedroom on East 54th Street. The price was $725,000, which soon dropped to $699,000, and the monthly maintenance was $1,300.

But the apartment faced the monolithic Franklin D. Roosevelt Station post office. “You see nothing; you see tiles,” Mr. Pangilinan said. “It’s like a fortress, which might be good because no one can see in.”

His offer of $675,000 was declined. If he had seen the apartment later in his search he might have bid more, Mr. Lahav said, “but because it was early on, he was looking for ways to find fault with it.” The unit eventually sold for just over the asking price.

Then mortgage-interest rates began rising and “my numbers all changed,” Mr. Pangilinan said. Some apartments now cost more than his $3,500 limit, so they were dropped from the list.

Except for places in poor condition, every apartment he saw seemed acceptable. “For the most part, if it was a fair price, I could live there,” he said.

There was one notable exception: a large one-bedroom on East 56th Street, listed at $640,000, with maintenance of just over $1,400. The layout seemed peculiar, with the front door adjacent to the stove. “He couldn’t get the kitchen out of his head,” Mr. Lahav said. It later sold for $630,000.

Around the same time, he saw a one-bedroom on Third Avenue in the 60s. “I had to hide my excitement over the kitchen,” Mr. Pangilinan said. “I was measuring it and really imagining what it would be like. I could see people while I cooked.” The apartment was listed for $629,000, with maintenance of just over $1,400.

Others were interested, too. Mr. Pangilinan offered $620,000 and then increased his offer to the asking price; the higher offer was accepted.

His board interview was brief, with a reminder that the building did not allow dogs. “You can have cats and, I guess, a turtle,” he said. “I don’t have any pets; I have a plant.”

Mr. Pangilinan closed in the summer and painted with the help of friends. The doorman received some noise complaints. “When you close a can of paint, you have to hammer it, and I would do it at night,” Mr. Pangilinan said. “I shouldn’t have been doing that.” He has since added rugs with padding underneath.

In his new kitchen, he said, guests can “see me prepare and plate dinner — it’s a better experience for them.” Now he sometimes even prints menus for those five-course meals, which are eaten at a proper table.

And as for that $3,500 monthly outlay? He ended up exceeding it by $44.

He intended to make a large down payment, but changed his mind at the last minute and put down only 25 percent, the minimum required by the building.

It has caught many political observers off guard, not least because of the person championing the program, President Shavkat M. Mirziyoyev. A former Soviet apparatchik, Mr. Mirziyoyev served for 13 years as prime minister to the mercurial and heavy-handed Mr. Karimov, who in his final years had taken to imprisoning even members of his own family.

“This is the moment of hope,” Steve Swerdlow, a researcher with Human Rights Watch and a longtime critic of Uzbekistan’s political system, said in an interview. The rights group plans to publish a cautiously upbeat report on Uzbekistan, the first in years, on Thursday. “The question now is how structural and sustained this will become.”

Some see in the opening only a feint toward liberalism, intended to dupe international observers just long enough to lift trade embargoes imposed on cotton, a major export commodity.

Mr. Swerdlow, for example, has called attention to the arrest last month of a dissident writer, Nurullo Otahonov, after he returned from exile hoping to take advantage of the thaw. “It’s two steps forward, one step back,” Mr. Swerdlow said.

Still, the thaw, if it persists, could redraw the political map at the center of Asia. Uzbekistan is an important supply route for United States military operations in Afghanistan, a potential trading partner with Afghanistan and a steppingstone for overland trade between China and Europe — a role it has played since the days of the fabled Silk Road.

The thaw is all the more surprising because another powerful figure, Rustam R. Inoyatov, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, the S.N.B., the main successor to the K.G.B. in Uzbekistan, remains in place. It was Mr. Inoyatov who reportedly had persuaded the aging Mr. Karimov to prosecute his own daughter, Gulnara Karimova, on extortion and embezzlement charges and to imprison a nephew in a psychiatric clinic. The nephew has since been released; the daughter remains in detention.

Behind-the-scenes tension between Mr. Mirziyoyev and Mr. Inoyatov over the scope of the thaw has now become the main narrative thread of Uzbek politics, analysts say. For now, Mr. Mirziyoyev seems to have the upper hand.

“What is kind of fascinating is we don’t know the extent the current leadership wants to reform, how far they will go,” said Sean R. Roberts, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University and a close observer of Uzbekistan. “One of the characteristics of Uzbek politics is it is extremely opaque.”

Pressing economic woes seem to be part of the motivation. Uzbekistan, with a population of 34 million and a high birthrate, is unable to provide enough jobs for a bulging youth population, Mr. Roberts said.

“Economic concerns drove him to decide they had to delicately dismantle Karimov’s system,” he said of Mr. Mirziyoyev. “It’s possible they want enough reform to open their economy for foreign investment, without opening the political sphere.”

Still, Mr. Roberts said, Uzbekistan’s liberalization represents some of the first positive political news out of Central Asia in years. “It’s been quite some time,” he said.

The authorities are, for example, pointing to a recent acquittal in a criminal case, something virtually unheard-of in Uzbekistan, where judges traditionally rubber stamped decisions made by prosecutors. That is one reason the prisons are overflowing.

In foreign policy, the new government has sought to tamp down seemingly senseless conflicts with its neighbors over water and borders. The Uzbek opening helps Afghanistan, too, in enhanced trade; next month, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, will pay the first state visit by an Afghan leader to Uzbekistan since the American invasion in 2001.

The Uzbek government in September lifted restrictions on exchanging foreign currency, eliminating a black market and opening the way for foreign investment.

After years of criticism for bringing in the cotton harvest with forced labor, including by children, the government demonstrably called back students from the fields midway through this year’s harvest, though young-looking fieldworkers were still seen in some fields on a recent visit.

The government is replacing the cult of personality that swirled around the former president with a new national idea it calls “Enlightened Islam,” focusing on Islamic modernization, referring to the scientific accomplishments in algebra and astronomy achieved in Central Asia in past centuries.

“We are opening to the world,” Aliyor N. Tilavov, a department head in the Uzbek Foreign Ministry, said in an interview about the political and economic program.

Still, a heavy-handed police surveillance system tracking people suspected of Islamist extremism has not been fully dismantled. There are still no independent nongovernmental organizations or political parties.

And the government has released only 16 political prisoners so far out of a population that runs into the thousands, human rights groups estimate, more than all other former Soviet countries combined.

Mr. Bekjanov, a tall, strapping grandfather, bore the brunt of the old system. Human Rights Watch called him the world’s longest-imprisoned-journalist; he was convicted of a number of trumped-up charges, including terrorism, while he was writing for the opposition newspaper Erk, or Freedom.

He is now enjoying his newfound freedom, and he said he did not carry a grudge. “The man I am angry with is dead,” he said.

If the reformers triumph in what he sees as a struggle with the unreformed security apparatus, he said, Uzbekistan could see real change.

But he does not plan to return to journalism. Instead, he is writing a book, which he will call — after the story of his life and the name of one of the prisons where he spent 18 years — “Goodbye to Youth.”","Once Closed and Repressive, Uzbekistan Is Opening Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/asia/uzbekistan-politics.html

Such a media takeover would be a direct strike at Catalan institutions that have been instrumental in promoting a separate culture and language. It would also put the Spanish government on a path toward reducing media freedom in ways that worry many Spaniards, even beyond Catalonia.

But the prospect has left Catalan citizens and journalists especially anxious. Not least among them is Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, who said it would return Spain to “a dark period,” when the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco censored information.

“When a government says that it will take charge of a television station, I know that this is something very serious,” said Mr. Sanchis, who wrote his doctoral thesis about Franco’s censorship.

Since last weekend, the Catalan broadcaster has received messages of solidarity from the staff committees of rival television stations, including Spanish national television, where some employees have been openly criticizing their own coverage of the conflict.

Ignacio Escolar, the editor of eldiario.es, a Madrid-based online publication, wrote that TV3 “isn’t my model of public television,” but that he was shocked by what he described as the cynicism of Mr. Rajoy’s government in demanding “truthful” coverage.

The divergent story lines have sown bitterness all around, and extraordinarily harsh characterizations and criticism from each side.

Last month, a group of far-right protesters stood outside the studio of Catalunya Radio during the morning show of Mònica Terribas, the station’s most famous presenter.

They shouted insults and displayed a banner that accused her of leading Catalans toward independence just as a Rwandan radio station persuaded Hutus to kill Tutsis before the 1994 genocide.

“Somebody who compares us to the radio in Rwanda clearly hasn’t thought properly about what that means,” said Ms. Terribas in an interview on Tuesday. “It breaks my heart to hear people talk about us like monsters who manipulate brains.”

But perhaps the outlet with the most at stake for Catalans is TV3, which was begun in 1983 as an ambitious regional television project that Catalonia’s leader at the time, Jordi Pujol, used to reinstall the Catalan language, which was banned under Franco’s dictatorship.

Since then, TV3 has spawned a generation of Catalan producers who built their own media companies, in both Catalonia and the rest of Spain.

“TV3 was a decisive element in the construction of the new Catalan identity and society that Pujol wanted, but it also became part of a powerful system of clientelism,” said Josep Maria Martí Font, a Catalan journalist and former foreign correspondent for the newspaper El País.

Antonio García Ferreras, who runs a politics show on La Sexta, a Madrid-based television channel, argued that Catalonia’s independence movement had been “light years ahead” of its opponents, in terms of promoting its separatist project on every possible platform.

“The same ideology has been sold in every clever way possible, including on TV3’s children and food shows,” Mr. García Ferreras claimed. “I think the independence movement is perhaps now a victim of its communications success, having made people really believe that independence could soon become a reality.”

In Madrid, on the other hand, he added, “we’re now seeing a large part of the media respond in a way that is forceful but also disrespectful, building up an audience that seems happy to hear denigrating views about Catalonia.”

As the standoff has reached a boiling point, some columnists and pundits have resigned or been pushed aside, while warning against mounting extremism in the news media.

This month, Joan López Alegre, a Catalan university professor of communications, left alongside another regular pundit on TV3, signing off with an opinion article in El País headlined “Farewell to the circus of hatred.”

Mr. López Alegre argued in an interview that it would not be “illogical” for Mr. Rajoy’s government to take control of a Catalan broadcaster that had been “pushing not only a political project against Madrid, but also working to create a conflict within Catalan society, using public money.”

The conflict has put journalists on both sides under huge pressure, also because it often feels extremely personal.

Susanna Griso is a journalist who comes from Barcelona but has worked for the past 20 years in Madrid for the Antena 3 channel. She recently choked back tears on live television while arguing with a Catalan mayor about whether Spanish police officers should be stationed in her town.

“These are extreme circumstances when you’re giving opinions about an issue that affects your family and those you love,” Ms. Griso said. “From the media coverage, it often now looks as if we’re already living in different states, but real life is a lot more complicated than that.”

Mr. Martí Font, the former El País journalist, noted that the gap in the narrative was “galactic” on social media, where several videos have gone viral showing Spanish police officers and officials either celebrating and insulting Catalans or receiving abuse from them.

He forecast that Mr. Rajoy’s government would use Article 155 to squeeze the Catalan broadcaster financially rather than risk the controversial removal of key staff members.

“Money talks and it’s easier to turn off the tap to change an editorial line rather than enforce censorship, as we’ve seen with the problems of some newspapers dealing with their debt holders,” he said.

Mr. Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, acknowledged that his company could not survive without public money. The Catalan government pays 230 million euros, or about $272 million, of TV3’s annual €300 million budget.

Madrid has already used the stick to force Catalan media into line.

Last month, it warned that it would prosecute media companies that advertised the independence referendum. Ara, a Catalan newspaper that is committed to holding an independence referendum, heeded the warning.

“Some readers were unhappy, but we took this decision not only to protect our newspaper but also to stay sound and alive now,” said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, Ara’s chief executive.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

On Tuesday afternoon, Lídia Heredia drove home late, after spending 12 hours at her TV3 television station, presenting her morning show and then attending an afternoon newsroom meeting where executives discussed Article 155 with their anguished staff.","Among those measures, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy wants to guarantee “truthful, objective and balanced” coverage in Catalonia.

Such a media takeover would be a direct strike at Catalan institutions that have been instrumental in promoting a separate culture and language. It would also put the Spanish government on a path toward reducing media freedom in ways that worry many Spaniards, even beyond Catalonia.

But the prospect has left Catalan citizens and journalists especially anxious. Not least among them is Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, who said it would return Spain to “a dark period,” when the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco censored information.

“When a government says that it will take charge of a television station, I know that this is something very serious,” said Mr. Sanchis, who wrote his doctoral thesis about Franco’s censorship.

Since last weekend, the Catalan broadcaster has received messages of solidarity from the staff committees of rival television stations, including Spanish national television, where some employees have been openly criticizing their own coverage of the conflict.

Ignacio Escolar, the editor of eldiario.es, a Madrid-based online publication, wrote that TV3 “isn’t my model of public television,” but that he was shocked by what he described as the cynicism of Mr. Rajoy’s government in demanding “truthful” coverage.

Spain’s national television station, which is led by a central government appointee, runs news bulletins that have become “obscenely manipulated,” Mr. Escolar claimed.

The divergent story lines have sown bitterness all around, and extraordinarily harsh characterizations and criticism from each side.

Last month, a group of far-right protesters stood outside the studio of Catalunya Radio during the morning show of Mònica Terribas, the station’s most famous presenter.

They shouted insults and displayed a banner that accused her of leading Catalans toward independence just as a Rwandan radio station persuaded Hutus to kill Tutsis before the 1994 genocide.

“Somebody who compares us to the radio in Rwanda clearly hasn’t thought properly about what that means,” said Ms. Terribas in an interview on Tuesday. “It breaks my heart to hear people talk about us like monsters who manipulate brains.”

But perhaps the outlet with the most at stake for Catalans is TV3, which was begun in 1983 as an ambitious regional television project that Catalonia’s leader at the time, Jordi Pujol, used to reinstall the Catalan language, which was banned under Franco’s dictatorship.

Since then, TV3 has spawned a generation of Catalan producers who built their own media companies, in both Catalonia and the rest of Spain.

“TV3 was a decisive element in the construction of the new Catalan identity and society that Pujol wanted, but it also became part of a powerful system of clientelism,” said Josep Maria Martí Font, a Catalan journalist and former foreign correspondent for the newspaper El País.

Antonio García Ferreras, who runs a politics show on La Sexta, a Madrid-based television channel, argued that Catalonia’s independence movement had been “light years ahead” of its opponents, in terms of promoting its separatist project on every possible platform.

“The same ideology has been sold in every clever way possible, including on TV3’s children and food shows,” Mr. García Ferreras claimed. “I think the independence movement is perhaps now a victim of its communications success, having made people really believe that independence could soon become a reality.”

In Madrid, on the other hand, he added, “we’re now seeing a large part of the media respond in a way that is forceful but also disrespectful, building up an audience that seems happy to hear denigrating views about Catalonia.”

As the standoff has reached a boiling point, some columnists and pundits have resigned or been pushed aside, while warning against mounting extremism in the news media.

This month, Joan López Alegre, a Catalan university professor of communications, left alongside another regular pundit on TV3, signing off with an opinion article in El País headlined “Farewell to the circus of hatred.”

Mr. López Alegre argued in an interview that it would not be “illogical” for Mr. Rajoy’s government to take control of a Catalan broadcaster that had been “pushing not only a political project against Madrid, but also working to create a conflict within Catalan society, using public money.”

The conflict has put journalists on both sides under huge pressure, also because it often feels extremely personal.

Susanna Griso is a journalist who comes from Barcelona but has worked for the past 20 years in Madrid for the Antena 3 channel. She recently choked back tears on live television while arguing with a Catalan mayor about whether Spanish police officers should be stationed in her town.

“These are extreme circumstances when you’re giving opinions about an issue that affects your family and those you love,” Ms. Griso said. “From the media coverage, it often now looks as if we’re already living in different states, but real life is a lot more complicated than that.”

Mr. Martí Font, the former El País journalist, noted that the gap in the narrative was “galactic” on social media, where several videos have gone viral showing Spanish police officers and officials either celebrating and insulting Catalans or receiving abuse from them.

He forecast that Mr. Rajoy’s government would use Article 155 to squeeze the Catalan broadcaster financially rather than risk the controversial removal of key staff members.

“Money talks and it’s easier to turn off the tap to change an editorial line rather than enforce censorship, as we’ve seen with the problems of some newspapers dealing with their debt holders,” he said.

Mr. Sanchis, the general manager of TV3, acknowledged that his company could not survive without public money. The Catalan government pays 230 million euros, or about $272 million, of TV3’s annual €300 million budget.

Madrid has already used the stick to force Catalan media into line.

Last month, it warned that it would prosecute media companies that advertised the independence referendum. Ara, a Catalan newspaper that is committed to holding an independence referendum, heeded the warning.

“Some readers were unhappy, but we took this decision not only to protect our newspaper but also to stay sound and alive now,” said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, Ara’s chief executive.

In contrast to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon took repeated turns at playing the madman. In 1969, during negotiations with North Vietnam, he sent a squadron of 18 nuclear-armed B-52s toward Moscow and staged a worldwide nuclear readiness alert, all to appear so unbalanced that the Soviets would pressure Hanoi to give in. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war,” he told his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman.

Historians continue to debate how effective Nixon’s maneuver was; the Soviet Union was taken aback, but then again the American role in the war lasted three and a half more years. But it’s also important to remember that Nixon was not in fact a madman and chose his “irrational” moves with precision. An old foreign-policy hand, he knew exactly whom he was dealing with in Moscow and Hanoi, and could predict with reasonable accuracy how they would react. Yet even then, the results were inconclusive.

Put differently, the short history of nuclear confrontation demonstrates that effectively controlling the risks of nuclear war depends acutely on the personality of a particular president. It matters greatly that the world assumed Nixon was rational, and that many in the world harbor concerns about Mr. Trump. There is a crucial difference between playing against type to introduce new doubts and playing to type to reinforce existing ones. For example, critical to Nixon’s strategy was what he said to Haldeman — that he’d been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in. But does anyone think Mr. Trump would do the same?

Consider the discombobulated way his administration has approached North Korea. Some members of his national security team are apparently trying to apply the sort of approach that the Cuban missile crisis enshrined, emphasizing diplomatic and economic pressure and characterizing military measures as a last resort. But Mr. Trump himself has frustrated and undermined them, doubling down on his own wayward improvisations by belittling Mr. Kim personally and proclaiming he “won’t be around much longer.” Meanwhile, he has undercut American diplomatic efforts on issues from the Iran nuclear deal to trade negotiations.

His threats to North Korea aren’t a case of temporary madness; they’re standard operating procedure. It’s hard to see the North Koreans backing down in hopes that Mr. Trump will return to reason and be a stable, rational negotiating partner.

The real risk here is that Mr. Trump does not actually understand the scope of the challenge he faces on the Korean Peninsula — and that he may in fact mean what he says in his threats. Any of the United States’ three basic offensive options — an all-out preventive attack on North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities; a limited attack on those sites; or surgical special operations to overthrow or “decapitate” the regime — could set off North Korean artillery barrages against the people of Seoul (and the nearly 30,000 American military personnel in South Korea) and wider war in the region, potentially up to the nuclear level.

Mr. Trump may be clueless about nuclear strategy and incapable of empathizing with the South Koreans. But even he should blanch at immersing the United States in a destructive, unnecessary and ignominious war in Asia.",The Madness Behind Trump’s ‘Madman’ Strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/the-madness-behind-trumps-madman-strategy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Before Karim Khalili became the soft-spoken vice president of Afghanistan, with his brother profiting in his shadow, his unruly faction controlled Bamian during the 1990s civil war among warlords. Now his men are clean-cut for a new democracy, but in those days they inspired fear.

One barber in the bazaar remembers when one of Mr. Khalili’s commanders came for a haircut. He had long disheveled hair, and hanging from each side were several grenades.

Another time, the barber said, another of Mr. Khalili’s fighters walked into the shop in a hurry. In his hand he had a tiny plastic bag containing four head lice. He handed the bag of lice to the barber and, with a smirk on his face, said: “I am going to the front lines, and you take care of these. If they get skinny or fat by the time I come back, you know what will happen.”

Justin Verlander needed just four pitches to retire Chase Utley and pinch-hitter Andre Ethier on a pair of fly-outs to center to start the inning, but that is when the trouble started. He walked Chris Taylor — his second walk of the game, both of which were drawn by Taylor — and got ahead, 0-2, on Corey Seager, but a 97 mile-per-hour fastball was right down the middle and Seager wasted no time hitting it out of the park to give his team the lead. Justin Turner popped out to end the inning, but the mighty Dodgers bullpen now has a lead to work with, which could be a big problem for Houston.

Waldstein: Did that seem like a familiar script? A two-out walk to Chris Taylor and then a two-run homer to left by the next batter? In Game 1 it was Justin Turner with the smash. In Game 2 it was Corey Seager, who went opposite field with a pitch that Verlander left up in the zone. And Seager knew it was gone — or at least had a good chance — right away because he was screaming as the ball left the bat.

All of the Dodgers’ runs so far in the series have come on four home runs.

Now L.A. is 12 outs away from taking a 2-0 lead in the series by beating the Astros’ two best pitchers, and the Dodgers have a favorable pitching matchup in Game 3.

Top 7th: Dodgers’ bullpen stays strong.

Ross Stripling was the fourth Dodgers pitcher of the game and he lasted just four pitches, each of which was a ball. The walk to the struggling Marwin Gonzalez resulted in yet another pitching change, with Brandon Morrow coming in to face Josh Reddick, and the right-hander came through in a big way by getting Reddick to ground into a double play. He allowed a single to Evan Gattis, who was pinch-hitting for Justin Verlander, but finished off the inning by inducing a grounder to short from George Springer.

With Verlander now out of the game, his final line was six innings, two hits and three earned runs. He struck out five and walked two.

Bottom 7th: Harris Keeps it close for Astros.

With Will Harris on in relief for Houston, Cody Bellinger led off the inning and reached on a throwing error. He advanced to second on a curveball in the dirt that was ruled a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout by Yasiel Puig. But with the infield in to try to prevent a run, Joc Pederson struck out on five pitches. The infield returned to their normal positioning with two outs and Harris struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning.

Top 8th: Astros cut into Dodgers’ lead.

Dave Roberts continued to be aggressive with pitching changes, but for the first time in the series he did not quite have the magic touch as the Astros narrowed the Dodgers’ lead to 3-2.

After Alex Bregman led off the inning with a ground-rule double off Brandon Morrow, Roberts turned to his closer, Kenley Jansen, hoping for a six-out save. Jansen was able to get a groundout from Jose Altuve, but Bregman advanced to third on that play and then scored on a single by Carlos Correa. Jansen recovered to get a pop-out from Yulieski Gurriel and then ended the inning by striking out Brian McCann. Unless the Dodgers can extend the lead in the bottom of the 8th, Jansen will have just one run to work with in the ninth.

Waldstein: The Astros finally break through against the Dodgers bullpen, which had not surrendered a run in 28 consecutive innings in the postseason.

Jansen, who is being asked to get a 6-out save, was 41 for 42 in save opportunities in the regular season. He had one five-out save this year and earned a win in a two-inning performance in extra innings. He has a five-out save and a four-out save this postseason.

Bottom 8th: Dodgers riding Jansen for six-out save.

It was a quick inning for the Dodgers offense. Chase Utley flew out to left, pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez grounded out to short, and Chris Taylor flew out to left to end the inning.

The Dodgers are three outs away from a 2-0 lead in the series with their dominant closer, Kenley Jansen, trying to finish a six-out save.

Top 9th: Gonzalez breaks out of slump to tie game.

Kenley Jansen only had one six-out save in his career coming into today’s game, and he will leave with only one after he allowed a game-tying solo homer to Marwin Gonzalez to start the ninth inning.

After the home run, Jansen got a quick out from Josh Reddick, who popped out to second, and retired pinch-hitter Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center, but he allowed a two-out double to George Springer. With the go-ahead run on base, Jansen was able to stop the bleeding by retiring Alex Bregman on a grounder to short.

With the Dodgers already having used five relievers, including their three best, they could run into manpower issues if this tie game stretches on for a while.

Waldstein: It was only Jansen’s second blown save of the year. His first was July 23 in Atlanta when he gave up a game-tying, three-run home run to Matt Adams. But the Dodgers came back to win that game, 5-4, and are 98-0 when leading after 8 innings this year, including the postseason.

Bottom 9th: Bellinger’s blast ends at warning track.

Houston turned to their closer in the ninth and Ken Giles started things off by striking out Corey Seager. He retired Justin Turner on a grounder to short and narrowly escaped a walk-off home run when Cody Bellinger’s deep blast to right was caught at the warning track by Josh Reddick. This game is headed to extra innings.

Top 10th: Back-to-back homers give Astros a lead.

Houston badly needed its best hitters to start delivering, and Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa did that in a big way by starting the 10th inning with back-to-back home runs to give the Astros a 5-3 lead.

The Dodgers ran out of top-shelf relievers, thanks to the aggressiveness of Dave Roberts in trying to protect a narrow lead earlier in the game, so Josh Fields came in for the 10th. Roberts’s aggressiveness had paid off throughout the postseason, but it backfired in Game 2, with Fields giving up the two home runs, and a double to Yulieski Gurriel, before being replaced by Tony Cingrani. Cingrani made quick work of the Astros, allowing just an intentional walk. Houston is now three outs away from victory.

Waldstein: That was Altuve’s sixth postseason home run. Not too shabby. And Carlos Correa follows it up with another blast, the third by the Astros in the last two innings. Correa with an epic bat flip, too. This game, and the series, has pivoted in a hurry, and Dodger Stadium is very quiet.

Bottom 10th: Dodgers storm back to tie game.

The Astros went ahead 5-3 in the top of the 10th, and sent their closer, Ken Giles, out for a second inning in hopes of finishing off the victory. The Dodgers had other plans. Yasiel Puig led off the inning with a home run, and after Giles struck out two batters, Los Angeles tied things up on a walk to Logan Forsythe and a single by Kike Hernandez. Chris Devenski relieved Giles, and with the winning run at second base, he got Chris Taylor to fly out to center to end the inning.

Waldstein: I have been at some great World Series games, and this one now joins the list. Leads have been erased, home runs all over the place, blown saves, classic bat flips, and to top it all off, the second base umpire, Laz Diaz, gets hit in the upper leg with a pickoff attempt. Had it not hit him, Kike Hernandez certainly would have been on third base, and that might have changed how Dvensky would have pitched to Taylor.

When Forsythe slid home for the tying run, the upper decks of Dodger Stadium were swaying slightly. I remember that from Shea Stadium in 1999 and 2000. A bit unsettling.

Top 11th: Springer goes deep to put Astros on top.

Brandon McCarthy was not on the N.L.C.S. roster for the Dodgers, but he was added as an extra arm for the World Series. Because the team was officially out of relievers, he was on the mound to try to keep Los Angeles in the game in the 11th. Cameron Maybin led off the inning with a single and stole second before George Springer, who had been ice-cold coming into the game, hit a monster blast to right-center that once again put the Astros on top. McCarthy ended the damage there, getting three quick outs, but the Dodgers now have three outs to stay alive in what has become a wild game.

Bottom 11th: One more home run, but not enough for Dodgers.

Chris Devenski was back out for a second inning of work and he started things off by getting Corey Seager to line out to center. That brought up Justin Turner, and the postseason hero for the Dodgers hit a liner that looked like it might sneak through the infield before Alex Bregman ranged to his left and was able to snare it for the second out. That brought up Charlie Culberson, and the last man on the Dodgers’ bench hit a two-out solo homer to center to narrow Houston’s lead to one run, but that was as close as Los Angeles would get, as Yasiel Puig struck out to end the game.","World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 2, Inning by Inning",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/sports/world-series-dodgers-astros.html

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

I went and looked at a bunch of co-working spaces when I first got to Sydney, and they were all packed with people trying to start something and network their way to success. But most people still rely on the main American brands and apps, at least as far as I can see.

Atlassian, the software company, is Australian and quite celebrated here. And Gumtree, which is Australia’s Craigslist for secondhand sales, is really quite good and useful. No offense to Craig Newmark (whom I know from covering tech ages ago) and his Craigslist, but there’s a lot to be learned from how Gumtree works on mobile and integrates messaging across platforms.

Amazon is coming to Australia and bringing its e-commerce services soon. Are Australians excited?

Reaction is pretty mixed. Americans living in Australia seem to be thrilled, especially those (like me) who got very used to relying on Amazon for almost everything in the United States. Some Australians, including small-business owners who will sell through Amazon, are also excited.

But mostly, I would say, Australians are curious, and a bit anxious about Amazon.

I just wrote a big story about Amazon and the book and bookstore industry here, which is strong and protected, and heavily resistant to outsiders. And the indie bookstore crowd isn’t alone in that. After all, this is a country that pushed Borders into bankruptcy, and where Starbucks has really struggled.

Malls and small-town Main Streets are still crowded all over Australia, which feels like a throwback to me as an American, and online shopping is not as common as it is in the United States. Just the other day, I interviewed a young woman in a bookstore — she was in her 20s — who told me she was not willing to pay for something online with a credit card. I was stunned.

But to some degree this may simply be a product of unfamiliarity. Once Amazon is here, and if it can really undercut some of the very high prices that Australians are stuck with, I imagine there will be a lot of converts.

Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life right now?

I recently bought (via Amazon, which shipped them here from the United States) a set of Bluetooth Jabra headphones, which were recommended by Wirecutter. And I love them. I can’t believe how liberating it feels to not have a cord flopping around.

What do you and your family do with it, and what could be better about it?

I use the headphones for music (of course) and for phone calls, but last night I called my wife walking back from dinner in Melbourne and I discovered that the microphone really doesn’t work well with a bit of wind. I don’t know how that could be fixed, but finding a way to ensure good audio for conversation would be one obvious improvement.

And as long as we’re talking audio: Hey, Sonos, how about adding some Bluetooth connectivity for those of us with unreliable Wi-Fi?

What is your favorite local Australian app or website and why?

Gumtree is my favorite. I’ve used it to buy a grill, a gas heater for winter and a bunch of other things. The selection is wide ranging; you can easily filter by neighborhood and distance.

It’s great, especially for someone like me who moves a lot and arrived here with nothing but a few suitcases full of clothes.",How Australia’s Technology Stands Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/personaltech/australia-technology.html

Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.
The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat.","This is not the first time that the Auto Alliance has dismissed the need for regulation. In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument. “We shouldn’t overemphasize the effectiveness of technology,” he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.

The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology. For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.

But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths. And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.

“You can’t teach people not to forget,” said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles. “There is a scientific reason why this is happening. It’s not that people don’t love their kids.”

David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten. Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription. Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.

“The brain process is the same,” Dr. Diamond said. “All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.”

General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing. If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds. The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year. The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.

This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child. Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.

Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices. One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing. The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat. If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.

Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device, but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.

When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, “I realized that while my car can tell me that, it can’t tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.”

“We get buzzers and warnings for everything,” she said. “How in the world do you not develop a reminder for what is indisputably the most important thing?”",Forgetting a Child in a Back Seat Can Kill.

(RED FAMINE: Stalin’s War on Ukraine)

作者：安妮·阿普尔鲍姆(Anne Applebaum)

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

在那次旅行中，她走访的大多数人都感到自己的民族身份受到现在所属的国家的威胁、这个国家在过去曾是他们的压迫者。他们觉得自己不公平地变成了立陶宛化的波兰人，或者是白俄罗斯化了的立陶宛人或鲁塞尼亚人——鲁塞尼亚人没有自己的国家，而其他人似乎都有自己的国家。这本书很有先见之明，因为近几年崛起的政治人士精心培养的正是这种怨愤的、受伤的民族或国家自豪感，从布达佩斯的维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)、莫斯科的弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，到华盛顿的唐纳德·特朗普。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

Back Story

“Do I look like a gangster? I’m a businessman!”

Such is life in the world of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, an installment in the long-running video game series that was released 13 years ago today.

Photo

The Grand Theft Auto franchise, an action-adventure series in which players pursue a life of crime, has stretched over 20 years and more than a dozen titles.

With 250 million units sold, it’s one of the most successful franchises in video game history, behind only famous names like Mario and Pokémon.

The games are known for their nonlinear, open-world style, which allows players to cause random mayhem in fictionalized versions of U.S. cities.

As such, the games have long been accused of glamorizing violence. (In 2009, Guinness World Records labeled Grand Theft Auto the most controversial video game series ever, citing more than 4,000 news articles.)

Even so, the series has been a critical success — several titles are among the best-reviewed games of all time — and celebrated for its soundtracks, its voice acting and the sly humor it applies to U.S. culture.

As one character notes, guns blazing, “Ain’t the American dream grand!”

• 在华盛顿，特朗普总统继续攻击杰夫·弗莱克(Jeff Flake)和鲍勃·考克(Bob Corker)，这两人是对特朗普批评最激烈的共和党人，他们都表示不会再次竞选参议员。



由于内部分歧扰乱着共和党人，千载难逢的减税法案的前景愈发成为了该党能找到一些共同点的最后、也是最好的希望。

但在希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)的竞选团队资助了一份与特朗普的性丑闻、他的助手与俄罗斯关系相关档案一事遭到披露后，他们在这件事的谴责上又变得团结了起来。

I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said.
Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship.

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance.","As a generation turned, house D.J.s turned remixes of Sade ballads into club classics, and a raft of hip-hop artists repeatedly sampled her.

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, Epic’s former publicity director and now heads an agency whose clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”",Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/style/sade-sade-sade.html

“When advertisers understand that we have approximately 1.6 million people every single day through the system — it’s a fabulous place to advertise,” Mr. Lhota said.

Effective immediately, the agency will no longer accept new alcohol-related ads; existing contracts for such ads will be honored until the contracts expire at the end of the year.

The decision disappointed alcohol trade associations, which have confronted a growing number of alcohol advertising bans in cities across the country.

“Science and research show that there is no benefit to banning this type of advertising,” said Jay Hibbard, vice president of government relations for the Distilled Spirits Council.

Mr. Hibbard said the majority of the American population, about 71.6 percent, was above the legal drinking age. Parents, not advertisements, are the greatest influence on preventing underage drinking, he said.

“This is not advertising on school buses,” Mr. Hibbard said. “This is advertising on a public transportation system.”

The board is still discussing how the measure will affect the partnerships it has with Connecticut on Metro-North Railroad trains, and with New Jersey on New Jersey Transit.

Underage drinking leads to over 7,000 emergency-room visits in New York City hospitals a year, said Councilman Daniel Dromm, a Democrat representing Jackson Heights, Queens.

But American citizens have been footing the bill for members of President Trump’s cabinet to crisscross the world on government planes.

So far, the fallout has been fierce: At least five cabinet secretaries are under review by inspectors general for their taxpayer-funded travels, and the House Oversight Committee is reviewing all travel by senior administration officials.

The travel of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came under the scrutiny of the inspector general in August. While previous Treasury secretaries have been known to use military planes for overseas trips, they have generally flown commercial for domestic travel because of the exorbitant costs of operating government jets.

As a practice, Timothy F. Geithner, President Obama’s first Treasury secretary, flew commercially, always in coach, when traveling domestically, Jenni LeCompte, who served as Mr. Geithner’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said on Wednesday.

Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and a onetime Hollywood film financier, appears to break tradition. For example, it cost taxpayers $172,283 for Mr. Mnuchin to fly to Florida, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia on a military plane. It could have cost $3,402 — about 50 times less — if he had flown commercial.

Mr. Mnuchin has flown on commercial flights and has used Amtrak “a couple of times over the past several months,” according to a Treasury spokeswoman.

But this month, the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General reported that since March Mr. Mnuchin had used military aircraft for seven trips — four domestic and three overseas — for a total cost of more than $800,000. Flying commercial on all seven trips would cost at most about $22,700.

Total 631,959 19,265 The price shown is the highest for booking a coach seat on expedia.com for a next-day trip in late October. All flights were round trips from Washington, D.C.

There are a few reasons that government officials take military flights. In Mr. Mnuchin’s case, he has said that his requests for government aircraft were made in the interest of national security — military aircraft are equipped to handle secure communications for officials in flight.

Other Trump administration officials, like Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, have taken military or chartered flights because they had scheduling conflicts or commercial flights were not available to their destinations.

Tom Price, the former health secretary, resigned after racking up at least $400,000 in chartered flight fees.

It is usually the White House’s duty to approve a military flight when a cabinet member requests one, in large part because the trips are so expensive. But the inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin’s flights by the inspector general revealed that both White House and Treasury officials failed to meet the normally rigorous standards to get the costly flights approved.

“What is of concern is a disconnect between the standard of proof called for” by White House guidance “and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests,” according to a memo submitted this month by Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general.

It cost more than $26,000 to operate the plane for the round-trip flight Mr. Mnuchin took in August to visit Louisville and Fort Knox in Kentucky. The trip attracted attention after Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, posted on Instagram a photo of herself disembarking a military jet.

It was boogie-woogie. It was R&B. Then it was rock ’n’ roll. Then it was pop. And it was all Fats Domino, the New Orleans musician whose easygoing image cheerfully concealed the boldness and subtlety of his music. Domino, who died in Louisiana at 89, both embodied and extended the New Orleans piano heritage of styles that are at once unswervingly propulsive and floridly improvisational; he also infused early rock ’n’ roll with New Orleans syncopations. His songs, most written with his producer and bandleader Dave Bartholomew, were often concise sketches of romantic strife involving heartbreak, betrayal, loneliness and spite. But he sang them with such sly good humor in his voice and his timing that they sounded like a good time. Here are 12 from his prime years.

‘The Fat Man’ (1949)

Fats Domino announced himself with this single: a two-fisted boogie-woogie piano intro with tremolo flourishes, verses that establish his 200-pound physique and his New Orleans locale and a falsetto vocal like a trumpet solo. Mr. Bartholomew thought at first that the piano was recorded too loud.

‘Blueberry Hill’ (1956)

Now indelibly associated with Domino, “Blueberry Hill” had been around since 1940, recorded by Gene Autry, Glenn Miller and Louis Armstrong, among others. But it took Domino’s utterly satiated vocal, atop a New Orleans backbeat and his trademark piano triplets, to make the “thrill” so thoroughly lusty.

‘I’m Walkin’ ’ (1957)

Handclaps and a breezy, bluesy guitar riff conceal still another story of romantic woe, this time coupled with resentment. Sure, he wants her back, but once he has her, he might just “say bye-bye” himself.

‘Ain’t It a Shame’ (1955)

Heartbreak has rarely sounded as survivable as it does on “Ain’t It a Shame,” from the terse stop-time beginnings of its verses — “You made/Me cry/When you said/Goodbye” — to its joshing saxophone solo. Domino sings about tears, but he’s vehement when he insists, “You’re the one to blame.” Pat Boone’s opportunistic cover version remains a disgrace.",Fats Domino Songs: Listen to 12 Essential Tracks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/music/fats-domino-best-songs.html

But his devotion to Elliot (really Mr. Robot), one-sided though it might have been, suggests that what he mostly craves is someone with answers to tell him what to do. Never a vision guy, Wellick’s more comfortable taking someone else’s plan and maniacally dedicating himself to it — he’s a slick suit full of avarice waiting to be directed.

In this he was like a human embodiment of a corpocracy that instinctively claims the work and spoils of actual visionaries for itself — think the fsociety gear for sale a couple weeks ago, or E Corp trying to ride the 5/9 hack to global currency dominance. But Wellick is clearly emotionally invested, too, at times to a sloppy extent. (“Subtext, you know?” Mr. Robot said, shushing his professions of love in the arcade flashback.)

He’s almost as eager to worship Elliot as he is Joanna, his affection seemingly stemming from the fact that each gave him a sort of purpose. The X-factor is, Wellick is also not entirely right in the head — that’s where the “possibly insane” dimension comes in, though it’s not clear if his is of the DSM-recognized variety, like Elliot’s, or some vaguer flavor of narratively useful TV crazy.

Whatever his damage, the apparent suggestion, in the nervy interrogation scene, that it derives from some rage, shame or fear over his father fell a little flat. (I think I preferred the enigma.) It called back to the contempt for his father he previously expressed to Elliot and obviously is of a piece with the daddy issues that drive “Mr. Robot.” But because we haven’t spent much time with Wellick, emotional revelations about his back story tend to have a “so what?” quality.

That said, now that we’ve dispensed with essentially Wellick’s entire Season 2 arc, I’m excited for the revelations yet to come. How will he respond to the news that his wife is dead and his son is gone? And now that he’s familiar with his beloved Elliot’s bifurcated nature, how will he deal with again being a tool of someone who, like E Corp or even his late wife, he can’t really trust?

Speaking of tools, it looks like “Mr. Robot” is really going there, in regards to making President Trump part of this story and the puppet of a foreign government to boot. (Of course the usual “Mr. Robot” things-might-not-be-what-they-seem caveats apply.)

Whiterose is manipulating events from his uncharted isle, summoning (as Minister Zhang) his propaganda arm — the cable news blowhard Frank Cody — to give him his barking orders. These include backing a Trump candidacy, rehabilitating Wellick’s image and promoting the fake news that fsociety is actually based in Iran.

“It’s brown enough, shouldn’t be too hard,” Cody says.

Get it? Cody’s fans are easily duped racists. They will blame Iran for their troubles and back Trump, even though “the guy’s a buffoon.”

“He’s completely divorced from reality,” Cody adds. “How would you even control him?”

“If you pull the right strings, a puppet will dance any way you desire,” Whiterose tells him.

Part of the energy of “Mr. Robot” comes from the way it plays with real-life events, a tactic that becomes potentially more intriguing as the series threatens to get into parallel worlds or other more dramatically sci-fi modes of reality distortion. (Some amateur theorists even posited that Trump’s election proves we’re now living in an alternate universe.)

But unlike the more impressionistic montage from the premiere, Wednesday’s Trump-centric sequence was pretty clunky — the unvarnished contempt made it feel like a jarring, didactic digression from the otherwise nuanced story.

I’m sure it’s terrifically satisfying to clown a man you despise with your TV show. But sometimes the show suffers for it.

A Few Thoughts While We Make Jiffy Pop and Watch ‘Big Brother’

• Bobby Cannavale continues to be outstanding as Irving, pairing the tremendous styling with a slyly inflected performance — you get the sense he’d sell you a Pontiac or have you killed with the same affable efficiency. Irving manages to serve as both comic relief — “Swedish Fish!” — and the glue holding much of the story together, and his ground-level orchestration of events and their participants, like his duplicitous pep talk to Wellick, is a nice counterpoint to the big-picture puppeteering of Phillip Price and Whiterose. Here’s hoping he sticks around long enough to finish “Beach Towel.”

• I was happy to see last year’s breakout Joey Badass return, if only briefly.

• Turns out not only did Elliot take out the gun hidden in the popcorn machine, he tried to use it to kill Wellick, who took the misfire as further proof of his and Elliot’s shared destiny and God-like status. Unfortunately for Elliot, Irving later cleared out the resulting squib load, enabling Wellick to eventually use it on him in the Season 2 finale.","‘Mr. Robot’ Season 3, Episode 3: Filling in Gaps and Taking on Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/television/mr-robot-season-3-episode-3-recap-tyrell-wellick-wallace-shawn-trump.html

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean?

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

Yet until the global corruption inquiries, many people working in the industry had little knowledge of the tiny company that appears to have struck gold with FIFA. United States law enforcement officials helped reveal that Mountrigi is a wholly owned subsidiary of a giant Mexican television network, Grupo Televisa.

Mountrigi paid about $190 million for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Dunne said. The contracts for the 2026 and 2030 tournaments probably cost more, but much less than they would be worth today. Since the agreement, FIFA’s new leadership has announced that the World Cup will be expanded to 48 teams from 32 in 2026 — and that the tournament will most likely be staged jointly in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Most of FIFA’s top management was removed in the aftermath of the corruption scandal, the biggest crisis since FIFA’s creation 113 years ago. Current officials of the organization, which is based in Zurich, have refused to make public the details of the arrangement with Mountrigi.

Mountrigi and Televisa both declined to comment.

Mountrigi was supported in its dealings with FIFA by Alejandro Burzaco, an Argentine businessman, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Burzaco last year pleaded guilty to bribing soccer officials so that the company he ran would be awarded rights to the biggest regional tournaments. The company, Torneos y Competencias, also pleaded guilty, and agreed to pay $112.8 million to settle the case.

In court papers related to Torneos’s guilty plea, prosecutors said an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in Latin America had helped to pay millions in bribes to get the rights in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay for the next four World Cups. Mountrigi, the Televisa affiliate, was awarded those rights and immediately sold them to Burzaco.

Burzaco had over the years funneled millions of dollars in bribes to Julio Grondona, who was responsible for FIFA’s finance committee and was one of its most powerful leaders until his death in 2014.

Televisa said last year that neither its employees nor those of Mountrigi had ever “paid any bribes nor any kickback to FIFA officials related to the acquisition of rights.”

The rights in question are also under scrutiny in Switzerland, where a statement from the attorney general’s office said an unnamed businessman had bribed FIFA’s former secretary general Jérôme Valcke in return for “the award of media rights for certain countries at the FIFA World Cups in 2018, 2022, 2026 and 2030.”

Mountrigi’s rights, and those it sold to Torneos, are the only ones that match those described in the Swiss complaint. Niclas Ericson, the FIFA executive responsible for its television division at the time, did not respond to a request for comment.

Burzaco’s lawyer, Sean Casey, declined to comment when asked if his client was the unnamed businessman accused in Switzerland. The Swiss attorney general’s office said it could not comment.

The Swiss also accused the Qatari businessman Nasser al-Khelaifi, who is the Paris St.-Germain soccer club’s chairman, of bribing Valcke in return for a separate package of rights to the 2026 and 2030 World Cups. Khelaifi, who denies the allegations, met with prosecutors on Wednesday.

The United States has charged more than 40 individuals and businesses with a range of corruption-related crimes, and it has also brought to light details of sports rights deals that had traditionally been secured behind the scenes with little outside scrutiny.

Since a powerful group of Brazilian and Argentine businessmen was exposed, some of the world’s largest sports rights companies, including WME-IMG and Lagardère Sports and Entertainment, have been able to enter a market that had been closed to them for decades.

Beyond the rights it sold to Torneos as part of the agreement with Burzaco, Mountrigi has not signed deals in any of the other territories it has for the 2026 and 2030 events. That means the company can reap greater than planned profits from the expanded World Cup and a possible United States-led tournament in 2026. For FIFA, which is reliant on the quadrennial World Cup for more than 90 percent of its income of more than $5 billion, the deal might bring regret.

“They’ve expanded the World Cup and have got no chance of tapping into incremental value in all of the areas where that value is likely to have a large increase,” Dunne said.",How Did a Tiny Swiss Company Quietly Secure Valuable World Cup TV Rights?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/soccer/fifa-world-cup.html

On a recent sunny afternoon, Mr. Panek was sitting in Tavern on the Green with Gus napping by his feet, cooling off after a six-mile jog around the Central Park loop.

“Gus sets the pace,” he said, “and I follow him.” Trotting at a nine-minute-mile clip, Gus, 5, is trained to avoid obstacles, slow down for congestion and, above all, keep Mr. Panek safe. Gus runs only when he feels confident there’s no danger, and he is trained to ignore commands that seem risky.

I’d like to take seriously the chief justice’s evident worry about the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and play it out a bit. The concern is not a new one for John Roberts. It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the public’s view.

“It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,” he said then, adding: “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.”

So I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: “The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.”

And assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal. The gap isn’t huge — 30 percent “too conservative” to 23 percent “too liberal” — but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant. In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, “too liberal” outstripped “too conservative” with a gap of 17 percent. Gallup’s analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third. In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.

The chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the court’s modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them. There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the court’s liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure. That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.

I assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument. And I’d like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart. Whatever happens with this case — a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately — there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.

In the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the court’s hands on these issues. Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases. It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina. In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings. These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.

The Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court. When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Court’s door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the court’s interests are best served by sitting it out?",Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Court’s Legitimacy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/politics-supreme-court-legitimacy.html

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case.
In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota.
Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?

“I just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,” she said of her son’s punishment. “And pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.”","‘Willing to Do Everything,’ Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html

Moreover, once identified with a group or, in this instance, a political party, members are motivated to protect and advance the party’s status and electoral dominance as a way to maintain their party’s positive distinctiveness.
Not only are Republicans willing to support Trump, but both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to demonize the leadership of the opposing party.
While attention has focused on Trump and the Republican Party (since both are in power), Democrats are hardly exempt from tribalism.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: “Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?” The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.","The nomination of an untraditional candidate from outside the party’s mainstream turned the 2016 election into “a stress test for Republican partisanship, and it passed with flying colors,” Theodoridis wrote.

“Republicans identify, at a deep psychological level, more strongly with their party than do Democrats,” according to Theodoridis:

The evidence is rather clear that the modern hyper-polarization is far more characterized by tribal division than by ideological distance. The real story seems to be the growing us-versus-them, in-group/out-group dynamic. If you look at what we call thermometer scores, which have respondents rate their feelings about groups from cold to warm, zero degrees to 100 degrees, the average rating of the other party has dropped from nearly 50 degrees in the early 1980s to temperatures in the 30s today.

Theodoridis summed up the conclusions he and his colleagues reached in a blog post in Scientific American in November 2016:

Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group. Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.

In other words, the assumption that many Republican voters would be repelled by Donald Trump turned out to be wrong; instead party loyalty — “a visceral, even subconscious, attachment” — takes precedence.

In fact, as the political scientists Leonie Huddy, Lilliana Mason and Lene Aarøe argue in an article in American Political Science Review, the most powerful form of partisanship is not principled, ideological commitment to conservative or liberal policies, but “expressive partisanship,” which is more of a gut commitment:

A subjective sense of belonging to a group that is internalized to varying degrees, resulting in individual differences in identity strength, a desire to positively distinguish the group from others, and the development of ingroup bias. Moreover, once identified with a group or, in this instance, a political party, members are motivated to protect and advance the party’s status and electoral dominance as a way to maintain their party’s positive distinctiveness.

Traditionally, political scientists have measured partisanship by asking voters the following questions: “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?” Those who say Republican or Democrat are then asked “Would you call yourself a strong Republican/Democrat or a not very strong Republican/Democrat?” Independents are asked “Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic Party?” Respondents are then ranked on a seven point scale from strong Democrat to strong Republican.

Political scientists measure expressive partisanship by looking at responses to more subjective questions, including “How important is being a Democrat or Republican to you?”, “How well does the term Democrat or Republican describe you?” and “When talking about Democrats or Republicans, how often do you use ‘we’ instead of ‘they’?”

It turns out, according to Huddy, Mason and Aarøe, that those who are strong partisans on the basis of emotional and expressive links to their parties feel angrier

when threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of victory. In contrast, those who hold a strong and ideologically consistent position on issues are no more aroused emotionally than others by party threats or reassurances.

These expressive partisans also

feel increased schadenfreude, a complex positive emotion, when they read about bad things happening to or reflecting poorly on a political candidate of the other party. They even feel this positive emotion in reaction to events that are clearly negative.

Three other political scientists — Shanto Iyengar, Gaurav Sood and Yphtach Lelkes — reached a similar conclusion in a 2012 paper, “Affect, Not Ideology: A Social Identity Perspective on Polarization.”

They argue that instead of treating polarization in the general electorate as a conflict over competing policies, the better measure is “affective polarization,” which is their term for the way voters “not only increasingly dislike the opposing party,” but are also willing to “impute negative traits to the rank-and-file of the out-party.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Iyengar and his co-authors contend that

affective polarization has permeated judgments about interpersonal relations, exceeds polarization based on other prominent social cleavages, and that levels of partisan affect are significantly higher in America.

In a 2017 paper, “All in the Eye of the Beholder: Asymmetry in Ideological Accountability,” Iyengar and Sood provide further insight into how so many Republicans found their way to voting for Trump.

They demonstrate that partisan voters’ approval of their party’s leaders “bears little relationship with their ideological extremity.” Because of this, candidates like Trump “enjoy considerable leeway to stake out positions at odds with the preferences of their supporters.”

Iyengar and Sood buttress their analysis by pointing out that from December 2008 to August 2010, “Sarah Palin’s support never once slipped below 69% among Republicans,” even though her positions were well to the right of the average Republican voter and she was subjected to brutal ridicule in the liberal media.

The growing strength of the kind of partisanship that is widespread today — whether you call it visceral, expressive, affective or tribal — undermines the workings of democratic governance. Not only are Republicans willing to support Trump, but both Democrats and Republicans are inclined to demonize the leadership of the opposing party.

Iyengar and Sood describe this as the “boomerang effect”:

The position attributed to a disliked party perceived as ideologically distant is pushed even further away from the receiver’s position. For instance, a Democrat who encounters a Republican campaign ad on government spending enlarges the discrepancy between herself and the Republican on the issue.

While attention has focused on Trump and the Republican Party (since both are in power), Democrats are hardly exempt from tribalism.

After Flake denounced Trump on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, issued a statement making the point that Flake, like Corker, had waited until he was no longer seeking office to break Republican ranks:

Senator Flake voted with Donald Trump 91% of the time. His retirement is a symbol of a Republican Party whose leaders allow Donald Trump’s divisive politics to flourish as long as it serves their political interests, and who fail to criticize this dangerous president until it’s too late.

Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, tweeted: “When Dems attack those GOP pols who stand up to Trump, perhaps they are the ones putting party before country,” a comment picked up by Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, who added, “Yes, this seems to be a case of tribal loyalties coming out at the worst possible time.”

Along similar lines, Theodoridis and Stephen Goggin, a political scientist at San Diego State, asked 1609 voters whether two unnamed senators were Democrats or Republicans. One of the two was described as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Wins Anti-Corruption Award,” the other as the subject of a story headlined “Senator Admits to Lying.” Democrats consistently labeled the anti-corruption senator a Democrat and the liar a Republican, while Republicans took the opposite view.

Perhaps most importantly, hyperpolarization is a powerful disincentive to compromise. How can you make concessions to your mortal enemies? To even start negotiations can be viewed, in this context, as surrender.

Trump’s grip on his party remains firm. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked Republican voters: “Do you consider yourself to be more of a supporter of Donald Trump or more of a supporter of the Republican Party?” The answer: Trump 58, the Republican Party 38.

Trump’s overall favorability ratings may be terrible (39 percent positive to 56 negative), according to a RealClearPolitics average of the eight most recent surveys, but the generic Democratic advantage is a relatively modest 9.2 percentage points. In an October 15-16 Economist/YouGov survey, Democratic voters said they planned to vote for Democratic House candidates 88-3 and Republicans said they would vote for Republican House candidates 86-3. Independents favored Republican candidates 27-22. These are not the kind of numbers Democrats need to win control of the House or Senate.

A number of questions present themselves to us as a nation, most notably: Where are we going? Off a cliff appears to be the answer for now, but who is going to help us climb back up? What can mitigate these developments except disaster? Over time, will we just swing back and forth between parties with no bipartisan achievements at all? What phoenix will rise from the ashes of our tribal partisanship?

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the United States. It is a worldwide problem, which is another way of extending the question. Germany, France and the Netherlands have one answer, still refusing to yield government control to right-wing populists despite the success of ethonationalist insurgencies in all three countries; Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have another answer — they are all currently swerving to the far right.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

It was merited: Charlie Culberson hit a solo home run off Astros reliever Chris Devenski, trimming Houston’s lead to one run.

But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.

“It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else,” Springer said. “When the last out is made you finally breathe.”

Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2. Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesday’s game without fraying some nerves.

“Two teams that competed for 27 outs,” Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. “An emotional roller coaster.”

The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece. They will return to action on Friday, with Houston’s Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.

The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles — it was 93 degrees at first pitch — should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable. Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.

“Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying,” said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason. “Doesn’t seem like the case the last couple of nights.”

Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregman’s single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on. But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.

Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later. Seager, last year’s National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers’ division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.

With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.

Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away. Facing the Dodgers’ stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puig’s glove as he dived for the ball. Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.

Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.

This time was different. The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros’ deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.

“I’ll take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning,” Roberts said.

The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers. Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros’ season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series. But he drilled a 94 m.p.h. cutter, Jansen’s trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.

It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.

“It was just flat,” Jansen said. “Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez. He didn’t miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.”

In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason. Altuve brought chants of “M.V.P.” when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.

Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot. The Astros’ dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.

“I loved it,” said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations. “He threw it higher than I normally do, and that’s way you should play in the World Series.”

Puig replaced the Astros’ euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th. Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.

With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddick’s throw to home plate.

As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski. And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez. It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate. Instead, it was a dead ball.

“Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him,” Hinch said with a smirk after the game.

This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning. McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut. He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.

Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment. He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.",Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/baseball/astros-world-series-game-2.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle.
PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Mr. Puigdemont leads a fragile coalition of separatist parties that control 72 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament.

Last Saturday, Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister of Spain, announced that, using Article 155, he was preparing to take full control over Catalonia’s administration and to replace Mr. Puigdemont, along with Catalonia’s entire separatist leadership, in order to stop the region’s secessionism in its tracks.

The mounting pressures on both men were evident throughout a day of confusion in a crisis that has presented Spain with one of its gravest tests since embracing democracy in 1978.

Mr. Puigdemont clearly hoped that a pre-emptive call for elections would hold off Madrid’s intervention. Earlier on Thursday, the separatist leader scheduled, delayed and then finally canceled a televised address in which he had been expected to take such a move.

His delay was apparently designed to secure a firm pledge from Mr. Rajoy that Madrid would not impose the emergency measures, in return for Mr. Puigdemont’s calling off a unilateral declaration of independence.

But in the time leading up to Mr. Puigdemont’s scheduled lunchtime news conference, with no guarantee forthcoming and word leaking out of his expected move, separatists started gathering outside the Catalan government building to protest the prospect of a U-turn.

Without a guarantee from Madrid, Mr. Puigdemont faced instead broadening descent in his own ranks, with some members of his conservative party announcing that they would quit if the Catalan leaders opted for new elections rather than secession.

That raised the prospect of an internal revolt that could tear apart Mr. Puigdemont’s independence movement.

For more than two weeks, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy had engaged in a game of chicken over whether the Catalan leader was ready to secede unilaterally, following a confusing address to the Catalan Parliament on Oct. 10 in which Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence — only to suspend it a moment later.

The pressures on both leaders have by now become formidable. Mr. Puigdemont risks decades in prison for rebellion should he push ahead with his secessionist plan.

In Madrid, Mr. Rajoy has been under severe pressure from hard-liners in his conservative party not to relent in the effort to snuff out the Catalan rebellion.

Last week, Mr. Puigdemont warned in a letter to Mr. Rajoy that Catalan lawmakers would vote for a declaration of independence if Mr. Rajoy imposed direct rule on their region.

Mr. Rajoy’s call for Article 155 measures — never used before — would allow him to to impose direct rule and to take control of the autonomous region’s police force and broadcaster.

Even before Mr. Puigdemont’s news conference, some were calling him a traitor.

Gabriel Rufián, a Catalan separatist member of the Spanish Parliament, wrote “155 pieces of silver” in a tweet, a reference to Judas’s payment for betraying Jesus in the Bible.

Mr. Puigdemont’s government has been flouting Spain’s Constitution since early September, when separatist lawmakers voted on legislation to hold a binding referendum on independence on Oct. 1 as a key step toward statehood.

An alliance of separatist parties has controlled the Catalan Parliament since 2015, after winning elections, but with only 48 percent of the votes.

After the October vote, Mr. Puigdemont was under intense pressure to declare independence, since Catalans voted for secession in the highly controversial referendum, which was marred by clashes between the Spanish police and Catalan citizens.

The vote, however, took place without legal guarantees and with most Catalan opponents of independence staying away in protest. The referendum was declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

This month, a judge from Spain’s national court ordered prison without bail for two leaders of the Catalan independence movement, pending a trial for sedition.

Last weekend, Mr. Rajoy insisted that using Article 155 “was neither our desire nor our intention,” but instead the only way to to return Catalonia to legality and normality and to maintain a Spanish economic recovery “which is now under clear danger because of the capricious and unilateral decisions” of the Catalan separatist government.",Catalan Leader Will Let Lawmakers Decide on Independence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/europe/catalonia-spain-carles-puigdemont.html

Although he has generally voted with Mr. Trump and the Republican majority in the Senate, he chastised his party on Tuesday for acquiescing in the lying and divisiveness that he said had come from the White House.

“Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as ‘telling it like it is,’ when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified,” Mr. Flake said in his 17-minute floor speech. “And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.”

Steve Evans, a Salt Lake City lawyer who writes about Mormon topics on the website By Common Consent, said it was no coincidence that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints like Mr. Flake and Mitt Romney would be among “the major headliners of anti-Trumpism.”

“This is borne out of a strong sense of personal morality, but also out of a cultural sense of decorum,” Mr. Evans said. “Mormons are prudes both privately and publicly. But there is also strong scriptural teaching behind it all. The Book of Mormon warns the reader that America is a choice land, that we must be careful in choosing our leaders, and the judgments of God can come on a people that choose evil leaders. Religious teachings like these may be informing their worldview.”

Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president ran into considerable antipathy in heavily Mormon Utah, where Republican candidates usually coast to victory. Evan McMullin, a Mormon and a former C.I.A. officer and policy director for House Republicans who ran as an independent in 2016, received 21 percent of the vote in the state. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won 27 percent, so altogether, more Utahans voted against Mr. Trump (48 percent) than for him (45 percent).

Max Perry Mueller, an assistant professor of American religion at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said he heard so many religious overtones in Mr. Flake’s speech that he plans to set aside his next planned lesson for the American religious history class he teaches, and instead have his students deconstruct the senator’s remarks “as a Mormon speech.”

Professor Mueller said the speech reminded him of the cadence, tone and themes that Mormon leaders often use when addressing the church’s vast general conference meetings in Salt Lake City, calling on members to refuse to accommodate the immorality of the larger world.

“That speech reflects a Mormon understanding of human agency and participation in history, that humans bring about change, and move the world towards perfection,” said Professor Mueller, the author of “Race and the Making of the Mormon People.”

In one passage near the end of his speech, Mr. Flake said: “This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more, and I say, the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise.”

In the telephone interview, Mr. Flake spoke of his deep involvement with his church, of serving as a missionary in South Africa and Zimbabwe in the 1980s, and of rarely missing a Sunday service with his family in Mesa, Ariz., over his 17 years in Congress.

But he emphasized that he did not want to imply that he received any direction in his political choices from his church or its leaders. Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, said it had a longstanding policy of political neutrality and would make no comment.

For the note of optimism that he struck at the end of his floor speech, Mr. Flake said he drew on a family motto that his parents had posted on the refrigerator at home: “Assume the best, always look for the good.”

“That certainly is informed by our faith,” he said, “and who we ought to be.”

He said he had to remind himself that in the end, what will matter more than his status or his job will be choosing what is right, as the hymn says.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect.
Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive.
“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.
The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.
So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus.
Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat.","GroupMe, it should be said, is a text client like WhatsApp that allows a user to be added to multiple group chats that vary in size from two to 200 members. A group chat over text message requires personal phone numbers or email addresses, but GroupMe is much easier: You can join or be added to different chats using a public Facebook or Google account.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

So he has some human feelings after all.

They’re human beings — human beings that took an ugly path, but still human beings.

The question I think a lot of people have is: Is ISIS finished? Are we seeing the end of them?

I think, in some ways, yes. The ISIS prisoners we talked to said they had been ordered by their leaders to surrender themselves and to escape. They were also very bitter and their morale was at a real low point. They felt that they had been betrayed by ISIS leadership, that their leaders were just saving themselves and that the whole organization was finished. And it’s true that they have basically lost all their important territory.

But, they started out as an underground organization, and there’s every reason to believe that they’ll continue in that capacity. They still have a lot of ability to wreak havoc in that form.

Why are there so few news organizations in Iraq and Syria? Did you see reporters from other organizations there?

It was a fairly large media presence. But it’s expensive to cover wars — especially to do it in a conscientious way, in which you take a lot of precautions. A freelancer who, for instance, went to Kurdistan would find himself facing fixer/translator fees of $500 a day typically. A driver would cost maybe $200 a day. And if you’re going for anybody on assignment they should be providing you with some sort of security. And that’s very expensive. That can be as much as $1,000 a day from some companies.

Do you travel with armed guards?

We don’t usually. In general, the principle that most journalists follow is that the lower your profile, the safer you are. In Afghanistan, where I work a lot, there are typically embassies and international organizations that move around in armored car convoys. We never do that because when you move like that, you’re making yourself a target. You can protect yourself against gunshots, but gunshots are not what we’re worried about these days. It’s bombs. Roadside bombs. And no amount of armor is going to protect you much against those.

When you’re in a place like Iraq, in a war zone for weeks at a time, is there stuff that you miss?

Nowadays we can pretty much get everything everywhere. Like in Kurdistan, one night a couple of us were sitting around and said “Let’s go to the movies.” So we went to the mall with a multiplex with 15 screens and we watched a movie. “The Hitman’s Bodyguard.”",A Times Correspondent Describes Meeting ISIS Militants in Iraq,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/reader-center/a-times-correspondent-describes-meeting-isis-militants-in-iraq.html

The political journalist Mark Halperin built an industry on tracking the fortunes of the flawed characters he followed through campaign seasons. He gleefully chronicled who was up and who was down in his best-selling books and television coverage and made himself into one of the most prominent and most highly remunerated journalists in the country.

The drama and intrigue came to him on Wednesday night, when CNN posted a detailed report that he had sexually harassed women years ago, when he worked as the director of political coverage at ABC News. The CNN report included interviews with five women it did not identify who said that Mr. Halperin had made unwanted sexual advances against them.

On Thursday morning, MSNBC, the cable network where he is a political analyst and appears frequently on the influential show “Morning Joe,” announced that he would no longer be a contributor.

In a statement, an MSNBC spokesman said, “We find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.”

Through a spokesman, Mr. Halperin, issued the following statement: “During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I’m going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.”

In 2016, California wildlife officials recorded the highest ever number of stranded otters, 474. That’s up from 299 a decade earlier.

Many of the otters are mortally wounded by sharks. Some show evidence of disease, and others of poisoning linked to the algal blooms that have also been killing sea lions and menacing the state’s fishing industry.

The blooms occur naturally, but researchers believe they are being intensified by runoff that pushes waste and fertilizer into the Pacific. They release a toxin called domoic acid that winds its way through the marine life food chain.

Melissa Miller, a Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian who has overseen hundreds of otter necropsies, said more research was needed to fully understand how domoic acid was harming the otter population.

But she added, “I think we can safely say domoic acid is a big deal in otters. The hard part is how big of a deal.”

Otters are regarded as a keystone species, which means they are essential components of their ecosystem.

That they’re struggling should sound alarm bells not only about potential harms to marine life, but to humans as well, wildlife experts say.

“I see them as sort of a proxy for the bigger issue of land-sea pollution,” said Dr. Miller.

And don’t forget, she added, “We eat a lot of the same things that otters eat. And we clearly see that some of the things that otters are getting are associated with the food that they’re eating.”

A benefit concert for Northern California fire victims is to be headlined by the Bay Area bands Dead & Company and Metallica.

The concert, under the banner Band Together Bay Area, was announced Wednesday as communities continued to reckon with the destruction of more than 8,000 homes and other structures.

The financial impact of the wine country fires is not yet fully known. Moody’s, the credit rating agency, estimated insured losses would total at least $4.6 billion.

The concert will be held Nov. 9 at San Francisco’s AT&T Park with tickets from $50 to $200. Also performing will be Dave Matthews and G-Eazy, an Oakland rapper.

“The recent tragic events up in Napa County, Sonoma County and Mendocino have left us all saddened, left us all flabbergasted and trying to figure out how in some way we could bond together and help,” said Lars Ulrich, Metallica’s drummer, in an announcement video.

All proceeds will go to Tipping Point Community, a nonprofit in San Francisco that works with the poor.

Separately, the concert organizers said $6.5 million in relief aid had been raised from a number of Bay Area businesses, including the San Francisco Giants, Google and Salesforce.

But the hardest decisions on how to mitigate the costs of the proposal have yet to be made.

The blueprint, as unveiled, would cost the Treasury more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to estimates by tax-writing experts. Now Congress must find a way to force those proposals into a $1.5 trillion budget hole.

Disagreements on how to do that have begun spilling into public view. In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, Mr. Trump and the House’s chief tax writer, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate issue.

Republicans hope that by the end of the year, they will be able to deliver to Mr. Trump the first significant revamping of the tax code since the Reagan administration, a feat that would show that unified Republican government can take on a big challenge and produce success.

But overhauling the tax code is an exceedingly difficult task, as evidenced by the decades that have passed since it was last achieved. And in the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Republican lawmakers already failed in their long-promised quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an outcome that makes the tax effort even more critical to the party’s fortunes.

The budget resolution approved Thursday, for the 2018 fiscal year, ostensibly maps out spending and revenue levels for the federal government. But its passage is meaningful largely because of the special procedures that it unlocks.

The budget measure contains parliamentary language that will shield a tax bill from a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, allowing it to pass with the approval of only 50 senators in a chamber where Republicans hold 52 seats. It also could pave the way for lawmakers to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.

In order to allow the tax effort to move along quickly, Republicans in the House agreed to pass the budget plan that the Senate approved last week.

The House had passed its own budget measure earlier this month, but by agreeing to the Senate plan rather than trying to meld the two documents, the timeline for passing a tax measure can be sped up.

In the end, the eagerness to tackle the tax overhaul ended up trumping other matters — including fiscal concerns that have been a central issue for many conservative Republicans.

For one thing, the House’s previous budget blueprint would have called for a more aggressive approach on cutting spending. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with legislation that would produce about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome.

But she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“Put simply, we have the opportunity to make history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three decades,” she said. “President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly.”

Democrats continued their drumbeat against the tax effort, warning that Republicans were preparing to cut taxes for the rich.

Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the budget measure was “not a real effort at responsible budgeting.”

They might say that they would have made a different choice had they known what we know now about the vulnerability of the teenage brain to cannabis. In the same vein, they could take the opportunity to note how very lucky they were that nothing went wrong, or to explain what did.

Parents sometimes worry that talking about their past use, or talking about illegal substances at all, might be taken as granting permission to experiment with drugs. If this is a concern, it can be addressed head on: “I did try pot, but I don’t want you to hear that as me saying that it’s O.K. for you. I want you to be smarter about it than I was.”

Other adults might welcome the opportunity to articulate the conditions under which they would give their blessing. For instance, the mother of a teenager in my practice said that she wouldn’t mind if her son tried marijuana, but only once he was in college, and only by smoking the supply of an uncle who grows his own. For parents who have no objections to cannabis use, questions about the past can open the door to discussions of what has changed in recent years, such as the growing availability of edible and concentrated forms of marijuana, and what hasn’t: recreational use of it is still illegal for minors in the United States.

Research consistently shows that adolescents take their parents’ guidance to heart even if they don’t always indicate as much. Regardless of the parent’s stance on marijuana use, it might be worth adding, “I’m asking you to be careful because I don’t want you to get hurt or find yourself on a path that you don’t mean to be on.”

The results of the same recent study on direct conversations about drugs suggest that personal or vicarious accounts of the downsides of substance use are especially compelling for teenagers. A parent who has a lot of stories to share might say, “Your grandparents were not paying attention when I was growing up and I got myself into situations that I should have never been in. When I became a parent I knew I wanted to do it differently. Let’s keep talking about this because I did enough learning for both of us.”

Some teenagers who ask about their parents’ past use are actually seeking the opposite of permission to try marijuana. They’re looking for reassurance that it’s O.K. not to. As one of my adolescent clients put it, “You can worry that you’re missing out on something — that it’s part of the ‘high school experience’ that a teenager is supposed to have.”

Mr. Hice addressed this concern by encouraging his son to see if he could have fun without using drugs and to “think about the pitfalls, your health, getting caught, getting expelled.” He also told his son that he watched his fraternity brothers closely both when they were high and also on the next day. From there Mr. Hice explained that, “it just didn’t look like the benefits outweighed the risks.”

Parents won’t always know what’s behind their teenager’s sudden interest in their personal choices and responding with either a detailed confessional or an abrupt, “That’s none of your business,” will probably make it harder to find out.

And adults who aren’t prepared to answer the opening question can still keep the lines of communication open, so long as “I’m not sure I’m ready to have this conversation” gently gives way to “but how come you’re asking?”","When Your Teenager Asks, ‘Did You Smoke Weed?’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/well/family/when-your-teenager-asks-did-you-smoke-weed.html

Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft’s Skype phone service.

Using the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they’ve never seen before.

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

SPECIAL POST — The 12th World Sudoku Championship, which I’ve attended in Bangalore, India, has just ended. It was the largest WSC to date — 206 competitors from 32 countries. Most countries were represented by four-person teams, although individual solvers could take part as well.

The contestants tackled almost 150 tough sudoku and sudoku variations over two days, scoring points for correct solutions. Point values varied according to the difficulty of the puzzles.

When it was over, the top five teams were China, Japan, France, USA and Czech Republic. China and Japan towered over everyone else.

The top individual solvers were Kota Morinishi of Japan (4,890 points) and Tiit Vunk of Estonia (4,887), with only 3 points separating them.

In the hospital, Geraldine’s family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.
“People don’t know what they’re in for,” Geraldine’s daughter reflected after the funeral.
Geraldine’s family was kind enough to agree.","“We can place a long-term breathing tube in her neck and a feeding tube in her stomach,” I said, “but there are no cases in the medical literature of someone like her living independently again. The best we could hope for is a life of near-complete dependence.”

“When we first came to the hospital, doctors told us my mom might be brain-dead,” one of Geraldine’s daughters countered. “Now, she takes breaths on her own sometimes. She’s already improving.”

Just as Geraldine was stubborn and exceptional in life, her family believed she would be exceptional in beating her prognosis.

“It might be different if my mom was 70 or 80,” her daughter went on, “but she’s only 56.”

For Geraldine’s family, the immediate fear of watching her die outweighed the unfamiliar pain of sustaining her on machines and watching her disappear in a long-term care facility.

Our medical team had seen hundreds of people like Geraldine, most of whom returned to the hospital month after month to manage complications of immobility. Sparse cases of recoveries were overwhelmed by painful, expensive, drawn-out deaths, ones we would never wish for ourselves or our own families.

But for Geraldine’s family, every decision was new. For them, nobody was like Geraldine.

In every other part of medicine, doctors make recommendations for medications, lifestyle changes and surgeries. We don’t offer cancer patients six different chemotherapy regimens and ask them to weigh the pros and cons. Yet when it comes to end-of-life decisions, doctors are terrified of violating patient autonomy. We are scared of our own medical opinions.

Instead of saying, “I recommend...,” we often offer a platter of life-prolonging measures, most of which are unlikely to improve a patient’s quality of life, but which offer the possibility of hope. The patient’s heart will still beat. Her personality will be gone, but her chest will still rise and collapse. Families see an opportunity for loss to be delayed, perhaps even dodged. Then we are surprised when they take us up on the offer to prolong dying.

“I think she would want more time to try and recover,” Geraldine’s daughter said.

So we kept Geraldine alive. A plastic breathing tube sprouted from her neck and a feeding tube with peach-colored formula buried itself in her stomach.

In the hospital, Geraldine’s family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.

When the infection started, a fever sounded the alarm. We counted the possible causes. Geraldine had a breathing tube in her windpipe, a feeding tube in her stomach and an IV line in her neck, each an access road for bacteria. Lying in bed put her at risk for pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Like mosquitoes in standing water, infections proliferate when the body is still.

Geraldine’s blood clots weren’t a surprise. Medical students are inculcated with the famous triad of conditions that predispose patients to clots, and Geraldine had all of them. Her body was inflamed and torn from the heart attack, infections and procedures that caused her blood vessels to release molecules that helped blood to clot. Lying in a hospital bed, not moving anything unless it was moved, her circulation slowed. Pools of static blood dried into a thick paste in her blood vessels.

Thanks to aggressive nursing care, when Geraldine developed a bedsore it was managed at an early stage. But the term “bedsore” is an understated euphemism. It recalls the annoyance of a cold sore or the tenderness of muscles after the gym. The grotesque image of bone pressing through skin is hidden.

In people who are immobilized, bedsores develop under bony prominences like the heels and the skull. At first, the skin becomes red. If the bedsore progresses, the skin’s outer layer, then the inner layer, breaks down. Finally, in the most severe stage, bone, muscles and tendons are exposed. The entire process can happen in just a few days.

Sixty days after her heart attack, Geraldine was stable enough to leave the I.C.U. She was in a persistent vegetative state — unresponsive to external stimuli. She opened her eyes, as if she were about to say something, but nothing ever came out. Her gaze roved around the room. An ambulance took her to a long term care facility, where she was dependent on machines and people.

“When you first hear someone you love is sick, you think it’s a short term thing,” her daughter told me over the phone a month later. “It’s adjusting to the long term aspect that’s hard.” Geraldine’s daughter woke up at 5 a.m. every day to spend time with her mom before work.

“I think it’s more of a disappointment for my dad,” she said. “He told us that if he ever gets sick, he doesn’t want any of this.”

Geraldine’s family lived between hope and guilt, with the weight of each side in flux. “If my mom knew what we were doing right now, she’d probably be mad at us,” her daughter reflected a few weeks ago.

Yet in the same breath, her voice rose and she said: “My mom’s a fighter, so I think she would be happy with us giving her a shot. We’re hoping for this miraculous turnaround.”

It did not come. Geraldine died of sepsis earlier this month, after more than four months of care.

“People don’t know what they’re in for,” Geraldine’s daughter reflected after the funeral. “It hurt all of us to see her like that.”

In the final days of Geraldine’s life, a doctor asked if the family of another patient in the I.C.U. could visit Geraldine to see what prolonged dying looked like. Geraldine’s family was kind enough to agree.

The visiting family chose to transition their loved one to hospice care.",The Symptoms of Protracted Dying,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/well/live/the-symptoms-of-protracted-dying.html

Many of those who remain will have to accommodate the president to survive primaries from the pro-Trump right. Already, in the high-profile campaigns of 2017 — governor races in Virginia and New Jersey and a special Senate race in Alabama — Republican candidates are mirroring Mr. Trump’s racially tinged campaign tactics. And Republican officials are putting up with the sort of incendiary candidacy that a party more devoted to nurturing a tolerant image might have rejected.

The reason? Many of their voters prefer the Trump way.

“We’re not an element,” said Laura Ingraham, a pro-Trump talk show host. “We’re the party.”

Ms. Ingraham, the author of a new book, “Billionaire at the Barricades,” on the populist uprising that helped elect Mr. Trump, said the conservatism of market-oriented internationalism simply has little mass appeal.

“There’s no constituency for open borders, endless war and these international trade deals that are skewed against the United States,” she said.

As for the limited government pitch that defined Mr. Flake’s career, Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, scoffed.

“This thing they’ve got today doesn’t work, it doesn’t move with urgency,” said Mr. Bannon, who is now orchestrating an effort to defeat Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump’s agenda. “It’s very nice. But it’s a theoretical exercise. It can’t win national elections.”

Even some of the president’s detractors on the right believe that the party base will stick with him because they like his agenda.

“We have a leader who has a personality disorder,” said former Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, “but he’s done what he actually told the people he was going to do, and they’re not going to abandon him.”

This grass-roots loyalty is why no prominent Republicans on the ballot next year have broken with Mr. Trump — only lame-duck lawmakers and Republicans out of office, such as former President George W. Bush, have been harshly critical of him.

At the moment, congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are trying to make common cause of an overhaul of the tax code because they see it as something of a temporary cure-all. A bill-signing ceremony on taxes would hand lawmakers something to run on next year and the president a much-needed accomplishment.

“It stops the bleeding,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina.

But even that holds risks. A tax cut that skews heavily toward corporations and the rich would hardly dislodge the populist view of a Republican establishment beholden to its donors.

“I don’t think the rank-and-file Republican believes that corporations are people,” said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to the Trump campaign who has also worked with Mr. Bannon. He was mimicking a Mitt Romney quote that earned Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, ridicule for being out of touch.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump painted a rosy picture of the party.

“We have, actually, great unity in the Republican Party,” he told reporters before leaving for a fund-raiser in Texas.

But even as Mr. Trump won repeated standing ovations from Senate Republicans on Tuesday when he visited their weekly lunch at the Capitol, the party’s lingering tensions were also on display. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, a longtime member of the Agriculture Committee, expressed concern about whether Mr. Trump would pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Republican present at the luncheon.

How aggressively the president pursues his platform on trade and immigration restrictionism could test how strong his grip is on Congress.

For now, though, the vision for a more populist-nationalist party sketched out by Mr. Bannon is being won as much through intimidation as through actual purges in Republican primaries.

What Mr. Bannon is trying to do — and what Mr. Flake’s retirement could further — is strike fear in the hearts of Republicans who do not display enough enthusiasm for the nationalism that Mr. Trump ran on.

“This should be a warning shot to any other ‘Never Trumper’ in the Senate today: Your time is up,” Mr. Surabian said.

That is playing out not only in the examples of Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

In Nevada and Mississippi, Senators Dean Heller and Roger Wicker have responded to Trump-inspired primary threats by taking steps to emphasize their fealty to Mr. Trump.

On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, endorsed former Judge Roy S. Moore in the Alabama Senate race, praising Mr. Moore, a caustic social conservative, as “a tireless advocate led by principle rather than politics.” Mr. Cornyn is the highest ranking Republican to formally back Mr. Moore.

But accommodation is not giving pause to would-be rivals. Danny Tarkanian, Mr. Heller’s Republican challenger, said the conversation among activists was no longer dominated by finding the most conservative candidates.

“The talk I hear is, ‘Hey, who’s going to support Trump’s “America First” policies,’” said Mr. Tarkanian, citing trade, military intervention and what he described as “worrying more about refugees from other countries than our own people.”

In the House, some lawmakers who have previously spoken out against Mr. Trump, such as Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, are now working to repair their relationship with the White House.

“The message they’re sending is: The way to survive is by accommodating him, changing their tone and professing loyalty to Trump,” said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard and a vociferous Trump critic.

The two governor’s races this year also illustrate Mr. Trump’s influence in the party. In Virginia and New Jersey, the establishment-aligned Republican nominees for governor, Ed Gillespie and Kim Guadagno, are airing controversial ads on immigration to both stir their base and win over some independents concerned about crimes committed by those in the country illegally. Mr. Gillespie, a veteran Washington lobbyist who served in George W. Bush’s White House, is also running ads extolling his support for Confederate statues.

In the Senate, Republicans have made clear that they will welcome Mr. Moore of Alabama — who has a decades-long history of making inflammatory comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims — to their ranks should he win the special election in December to fill the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. A handful of conservative writers have expressed concern about the message that tolerating Mr. Moore sends, but no high-profile lawmaker has followed suit, and a pair of Republican senators are even hosting a fund-raiser for him next month in Washington.

And in Colorado, former Representative Tom Tancredo, who was shunned by the Bush-era Republican Party for his harsh anti-immigration views, is considering a comeback bid for governor in 2018.

Whether Mr. Trump permanently realigns the party around his style and platform may depend on how much he remains true to what could be called Trumpism.

Mr. Graham believes that the president is not as wedded to some of his nationalist policies as his supporters want to believe.

“The best thing that could happen to Trump and the future of the Republican Party is for Trump to fix a broken immigration system,” Mr. Graham said.

By calling last week to offer his support to a handful of Republican senators that Mr. Bannon had named as potential targets, the president demonstrated he would not blindly follow his former adviser.

Establishment Republicans are attempting to convince Mr. Trump that “if you join with Bannon, you cut your own throat,” Mr. Graham said, because it could lead to an impeachment effort by a Democratic-controlled Congress.

But these arguments cause the early Trump enthusiasts only to roll their eyes. The party establishment, these Trump backers say, wants to govern as if the election never happened.

In reality, the biggest enemy of modern batteries is temperature. The cooler you can keep your battery, either while charging it or while it’s in use, the more you can prolong its life.

Myth 3: More megapixels mean better cameras

When small, portable point-and-shoot cameras took off and larger, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras became more affordable, there was a brief rush among manufacturers to push out models with greater numbers of “megapixels,” the unit of capacity used to define how much information a digital camera’s sensor can capture. Unfortunately, because those numbers dazzled spec-hungry consumers and could be used to market cameras, shoppers began to assume that more megapixels meant you were buying a better camera. And you can’t really blame them — marketers latched on to the idea, and even now, in modern smartphones, the first spec anyone mentions about the built-in camera is the megapixels.

All of this led to the “megapixel myth,” which has persisted for almost a decade. While most budding photographers understand that more isn’t always better in a camera, shoppers looking for a good smartphone camera, and the phone manufacturers themselves, haven’t seemed to learn the lesson.

Megapixels still count — they do tell you how powerful a camera’s sensor is, which is important for professionals or anyone who needs to print out physical photographs (when translated to paper more pixels per inch can mean more detailed prints), but it doesn’t necessarily tell you how good the photos taken by that camera will be.

To find that out, look past the specs (again!) and to reviews. Even better, look for examples of photos taken with a certain phone or camera and compare them to those from other popular models — or even the one you already have. Look for reviews that mention a camera’s lowlight performance and, perhaps most important, get familiar with your camera’s options. The best photos come from someone who knows how to tweak the settings for the perfect shot.

Myth 4: “Planned obsolescence” is why your phone slows down right before a new model comes out

It happens every year or so: Just before the latest and greatest phone comes out, your phone suddenly starts running slowly. Maybe it starts freezing, or the apps you use get sluggish. Either way, if you can relate, you can probably also understand the common feeling that this is all a plan by tech companies to force you into upgrading — a trick called “planned obsolescence.” While that’s a real problem in some specific cases, assuming it’s the reason everyone’s old phones get slow before new ones are announced is, well, a bit of an oversimplification.

In reality, it’s not a conspiracy, and it’s not some corporate trick to force you into the newest tech, or trap you on the consumerist treadmill. It’s just a side effect of an ever-evolving and ever-improving industry. As those new phones are released, they come with more memory, better screens, faster processors and other specs that, in general, you shouldn’t care about — unless developers start building their apps around them. When they do, they optimize their apps for the newer devices, leaving your older ones in the dust.

So as apps are updated to make use of all of the features on those new devices, they seem to slow down on older phones. And unless the developers care enough to make sure your older phones are properly supported, the problem only gets worse over time. The annoying end result may be the same, but you can at least rest comfortably knowing there’s no massive conspiracy (here, anyway) to make you keep spending money.

Myth 5: Extended warranty plans are worth your money

It’s tough to buy anything at this point without being offered an extended warranty. Whether you’re shopping online or in a brick-and-mortar store, retailers often dangle third-party “protection programs” and “service plans” in front of you, promising that, for a few extra bucks, they’ll replace or repair your purchase if damaged over the next few years. The problem with these offers is that they’re almost always unnecessary — or worse than what you could get otherwise with a little savvy shopping.

In many cases, the pricey extended warranty runs right alongside the existing manufacturer’s warranty, which means you may be paying twice for coverage the phone’s maker already provides. So be sure to research the warranty that comes with your device. Similarly, if you use a credit card, you may even have extended warranty protection through the card’s issuer — check with that company before you add the pricey phone to your cart.

Finally, consider how much the extended warranty costs versus the actual total of the gadget you’re buying. You may be better off taking the money you would have used on the warranty plan and stashing it in a savings account as a “rainy day fund.” Then, if you do need to pay for a repair or replacement, you can use your own cash instead of having to jump through the hoops of getting service from the company managing the protection program.",Five Tech Myths People Still Believe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/smarter-living/five-tech-myths-people-still-believe.html

It is dangerous to a democracy.”

Steve Evans, a Salt Lake City lawyer who writes about Mormon topics on the website By Common Consent, said it was no coincidence that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints like Mr. Flake and Mitt Romney would be among “the major headliners of anti-Trumpism.”

“This is borne out of a strong sense of personal morality, but also out of a cultural sense of decorum,” Mr. Evans said. “Mormons are prudes both privately and publicly. But there is also strong scriptural teaching behind it all. The Book of Mormon warns the reader that America is a choice land, that we must be careful in choosing our leaders, and the judgments of God can come on a people that choose evil leaders. Religious teachings like these may be informing their worldview.”

Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president ran into considerable antipathy in heavily Mormon Utah, where Republican candidates usually coast to victory. Evan McMullin, a Mormon and a former C.I.A. officer and policy director for House Republicans who ran as an independent in 2016, received 21 percent of the vote in the state. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won 27 percent, so altogether, more Utahans voted against Mr. Trump (48 percent) than for him (45 percent).

Max Perry Mueller, an assistant professor of American religion at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said he heard so many religious overtones in Mr. Flake’s speech that he plans to set aside his next planned lesson for the American religious history class he teaches, and instead have his students deconstruct the senator’s remarks “as a Mormon speech.”

Professor Mueller said the speech reminded him of the cadence, tone and themes that Mormon leaders often use when addressing the church’s vast general conference meetings in Salt Lake City, calling on members to refuse to accommodate the immorality of the larger world.

“That speech reflects a Mormon understanding of human agency and participation in history, that humans bring about change, and move the world towards perfection,” said Professor Mueller, the author of “Race and the Making of the Mormon People.”

In one passage near the end of his speech, Mr. Flake said: “This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more, and I say, the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise.”

In the telephone interview, Mr. Flake spoke of his deep involvement with his church, of serving as a missionary in South Africa and Zimbabwe in the 1980s, and of rarely missing a Sunday service with his family in Mesa, Ariz., over his 17 years in Congress.

But he emphasized that he did not want to imply that he received any direction in his political choices from his church or its leaders. Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, said it had a longstanding policy of political neutrality and would make no comment.

For the note of optimism that he struck at the end of his floor speech, Mr. Flake said he drew on a family motto that his parents had posted on the refrigerator at home: “Assume the best, always look for the good.”

“That certainly is informed by our faith,” he said, “and who we ought to be.”

He said he had to remind himself that in the end, what will matter more than his status or his job will be choosing what is right, as the hymn says.

The Dinner That Fueled the Civil Rights Freedom Fighters

By Bee Wilson

Like any good soup, a bowl of Louisiana gumbo can uplift you even when there is nothing to feel uplifted about. On Sept. 17, 1960, a group of students in New Orleans, three black and one white, sat down at McCrory’s whites-only lunch counter and refused to leave until they were served. The students were convicted of criminal mischief, though that would be overturned by the Supreme Court in Lombard v. Louisiana (1963), a key moment in the fight against segregation. But before this historic meal came another: The sit-in was organized few days earlier over spicy gumbo at Dooky Chase’s Restaurant.

Gumbo makes people braver; it satisfies the soul and gets you talking, says Leah Chase, the legendary African-American chef of Creole cuisine, who is still cooking at 94. “Honey, this is where they planned the thing,” she says over the phone from New Orleans, her voice warm and musical. She remembers the young activists who belonged to CORE — the Congress of Racial Equality — eating a series of lunches and dinners that September in her restaurant’s upstairs room.

The leader was Rudy Lombard, 21, a fiery orator. Also there were Cecil Carter Jr., another black student; Lanny Goldfinch, a white student; and Oretha Castle, a courageous black human rights campaigner whose mother, Vergie, was the bartender at Dooky Chase. It was illegal at that time in the South for blacks and whites to eat in the same restaurant, but this danger didn’t deter the CORE students, who often spoke of sacrificing their lives for the cause. They shared seafood gumbo thickened with filé powder (ground dried sassafras leaves), fried chicken and Lombard’s favorite Italian salad of salami, capers and olives, with Lolis Edward Elie, a local lawyer. Over the food there were intense discussions about what they could and couldn’t do to advance their cause within the law. The activists toasted their plans with glasses of Barq’s root beer. According to Chase, “When they were working, they didn’t drink so much as a bottle of beer.”

In 1960, Dooky Chase was one of the very few dining places in New Orleans where black people could eat with heavy cutlery on pressed linen tablecloths. Growing up, Lombard once told a radio interviewer, he dreamed of eating somewhere like that. His mother worked as a cook for a rich family, and she worked across the street from a fancy restaurant called Pascal’s Manale. As a boy, Rudy longed to eat there. Chase gave him and the other CORE members a taste of that restaurant ease. He once said he saw the restaurant as “an incubator of black people’s aspirations.”

Another activist who regularly ate there was Raphael Cassimere Jr., an emeritus history professor at the University of New Orleans. Cassimere remembers meetings of the N.A.A.C.P., whose office was a few blocks away, where people got “all steamed up,” but as soon as everyone was sitting down with Chase’s gumbo, “you’d be laughing again.” This gumbo was like the food of Louisiana grandmothers, Cassimere recalls, except that “you could get it 24 hours. And it was cheap.” Sometimes, in an extra-generous mood, Chase didn’t charge at all. She fed many of the Freedom Riders, who took a series of perilous bus trips through the South in 1961, trying to use whites-only restrooms and restaurants along the way.

Sometimes the activists arrived at the restaurant dirty, right out of jail. “Poor darlings,” she says. “I used to feel so sorry for them.” Chase sent them around the corner to Vergie’s home to take a bath. And then she fed them.

The Dinner That Dashed Presidential Hopes

By Brenda Wineapple

In 1884, James Gillespie Blaine, a Republican senator from Maine, ate a dinner that helped him lose the presidency. Blaine is now nearly forgotten, but during the Gilded Age he was a star candidate for the White House from 1876 to 1892, even when he didn’t want the job — and despite the pungent whiff of financial scandal always trailing him. “Blaine, Blaine, the continental liar from the State of Maine,” opponents taunted him, while die-hard “Blainiacs” called him a gallant “plumed knight.”

Whatever Blaine was, he had also been a speaker of the House, a secretary of state and a man who liked to eat. It was, after all, the period of the so-called Great Barbecue, when politicians and financiers and railroad buccaneers all splurged together, whether on the public trust or on oysters and Champagne. On Oct. 29, just one week before Election Day, when Blaine was poised to beat his Democratic opponent, Grover Cleveland, he accepted an invitation to a dinner in his honor at Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City. Since 1837, the wealthy and the notable had eaten there: Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon III, Jenny Lind and even Charles Dickens, who despised American cuisine. Delmonico’s seemed to rebut single-handedly the notion that American cooking, as one historian put it, insulted every sense but hearing.

The Delmonico family knew all about farm-to-table; they had bought over 200 acres in Brooklyn to grow fresh fruits and vegetables. (Regardless, the restaurant’s bill of fare was resoundingly French. Even the menu was written in it.) The name “Delmonico” came to symbolize luxury — and excess. At one particularly extravagant banquet, each woman discovered a gold bracelet folded in her napkin. And at the James Blaine dinner, while a full orchestra played patriotic tunes, the 200 guests were seated at huge tables covered with white cloths, tropical ferns and confections representing their occupations. On Blaine’s table was a model White House, apparently made of sugar.

Blaine never made it to the real White House. The day after his banquet, The Associated Press printed the elaborate menu, along with the guest list, which included the nation’s richest men, millionaires like Andrew Carnegie, John Jacob Astor and Jay Gould, who could afford a nine-course meal and, by implication, a nine-course president. They supped on “consommé à la Victoria” or “crème de volaille à la Berchoux” before choosing “kingfish à la Richelieu” or fried smelts for their fish course. For the course known as the “relevés,” they tucked into “selle de chevreuil à la Tyrolienne” (roast saddle of young venison surrounded by tartlets of sour-apple marmalade covered in puff pastry) or “filet de boeuf à la Clarendon.” Entrees followed: “ailes de volaille à la Lucullus” (chicken breast garnished with truffles and balls of foie gras), “ris de veau au chancelier” (sweetbreads in sauce) or “terrapène à la Maryland” (turtle stew). Not to be forgotten were side dishes like pommes à l’Anglaise (English boiled potatoes) and the roast course of canvasback duck. Desserts included prunelle jelly and chestnut soufflé, all attended by the appropriate wine. After dinner, the men were seen staggering to their carriages.

News of the dinner spread when another millionaire, Joseph Pulitzer, a Democrat, ran a front-page cartoon in his paper, The New York World. Titled “The Royal Feast of Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings,” it depicted a gaggle of portly plutocrats dining on “lobby pudding” and “patronage cake,” while a working family, at the foot of the table, held out a hand for scraps. In the background was a biblical inscription that referred to the handwriting on the wall. Cleveland supporters plastered posters of the cartoon on walls all over the state.

James Blaine lost New York by about only 1,000 votes, but that meant he failed to receive the crucial electoral votes he needed for the White House. And he never got any nearer to it — not as president anyway. But there are second acts in American life: After a long and conspicuous trip to Scotland with Andrew Carnegie, Blaine decided to throw his support in 1888 to Benjamin Harrison, who, once elected, made Blaine secretary of state again. By the next election, in 1892, Blaine’s appetite for presidential politics had dwindled, his gout had increased, and he quietly left the banquet.",The Dinners That Shaped History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/magazine/the-dinners-that-shaped-history.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

But Mr. Dorsey’s eye for simple solutions has not been enough to turn around Twitter since he returned in 2015 to lead the company he helped found in 2006. He has failed to rein in the use and abuse of the service by trolls and political actors, and he has not found a convincing way to make money despite its ardent user base.

At Square, Mr. Dorsey has led one of Silicon Valley’s more understated success stories, built from the little plastic white square that allowed small businesses to accept credit card payments via their iPhones. Square has grown into a much broader financial services company, despite some hiccups, like a much-heralded partnership with Starbucks that flamed out.

Although Twitter’s overall revenue shrank 5 percent in the second quarter from the year before, expanding the company’s losses, at Square, revenue grew 26 percent, moving the company closer to profitability.

The divergent fate of Mr. Dorsey’s two companies can be understood simply as a matter of timing and control. When he began his second stint as Twitter’s chief executive in 2015, the company was already struggling and had a series of internal problems that were hard to change, including executive turnover and competing strategic visions.

At Square, on the other hand, Mr. Dorsey was able to build the whole company from the ground up, with knowledge from Twitter of how things can go wrong.

“Square wasn’t Jack’s first rodeo,” said Randy Reddig, who was on the founding team at Square in 2009. “It was obvious early on at the company that he took lessons learned from his time at Twitter and applied them at Square.”

Mr. Reddig said that Mr. Dorsey’s education from Twitter’s fractious early years was particularly apparent in the control that Mr. Dorsey kept over hiring and compensation decisions at Square, with a focus on creating a loyal team.

Through Twitter and Square, Mr. Dorsey declined to comment for this article.

Mr. Dorsey’s success at Square and his trouble at Twitter also tell a broader story about Silicon Valley, where the boring, back-end businesses often end up generating more money than the flashy social networks and consumer services that capture the public’s eye.

Mr. Dorsey trained Square’s sights on a mostly invisible business — electronic payments — that has momentum as more and more commerce moves online.

Capgemini recently estimated that electronic payments should grow 10.9 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. It is no coincidence that the most successful American financial start-up of the last decade, aside from Square, is Stripe, which helps online businesses take payments.

Beyond just payments, though, Square has taken aim at the much larger goal of providing a tech-savvy alternative to the big banks, expanding out from payments to lending and online deposits.

This summer, Square applied for a bank charter in Utah, one of just three so-called fintech firms to take such a bold step (the others are Social Finance and Varo).

Square is most visibly positioned to use a bank license with its business customers, but the company has also been building more banklike services for consumers, most notably with its app Square Cash.

Square Cash is often described as a competitor and imitator of Venmo, the popular app owned by PayPal that makes it possible for friends to send one another payments by smartphone.

In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia. At various points over the past week, Square Cash was ahead of Venmo and Twitter on the charts of the most downloaded iPhone apps.

The big banks had aimed to challenge Venmo with their own service, Zelle, but that has not posed a credible challenge to either Venmo or Square Cash so far, the rankings show.

Mr. Dorsey and his team made several early design choices with Square Cash that helped make it different from Venmo. As would be expected from Mr. Dorsey, Square’s app has a clean, green interface, compared with Venmo’s busy blue dashboard.

Square also made an apparently boring technical decision, to use the debit card networks rather than bank transfers, to move money around. That has made it easier for Square Cash to put money instantly into the bank accounts of its users, and to collect a fee for the service.

These differences appear to have made Square Cash more popular with lower-income customers who more often need instant access to their money and who don’t have as wide a variety of credit cards and other financial options.

“We are reaching an audience that may not have a bank account or may not have a full suite of services from a bank,” Mr. Dorsey told analysts last quarter.

The shift in people using Square Cash as something more like a bank account has been an important one for Square’s bottom line. While Square and PayPal generally don’t make money when customers send money to one another, they can take a cut when customers start using the service to make payments at stores.

This all looks like a similar playbook to the one Square used with its original credit card dongle, starting with a simple service for an underserved audience and then building from there.

Keith Rabois, who was the chief operating officer at Square until 2013, said that the Cash app reflects Mr. Dorsey’s ability to make deceptively simple products that answer a complicated need.

Even though the revenue from Cash is small compared with the money that Square pulls in from businesses, Mr. Rabois said that “it may be the most important thing Square is working on.”

During Mr. Rabois’s tenure at Square, the future did not always look so bright. The company’s first attempt at a consumer application, Square Wallet, never took off and was discontinued, bringing down the Starbucks partnership with it.

Many analysts also expected that Square would have to reduce the price it charged businesses to process credit card transactions as it began working with larger businesses that had more options.

Over time, though, Square has been able to keep its prices stable by offering its business customers other services, such as payroll and scheduling.

A KeyBanc analyst recently polled 20 businesses that use Square and found that most of them had been offered lower card transaction fees by other companies but passed them up because of the add-ons that Square offers.

One of the most profitable such services is Square Capital, which offers small loans to businesses. The revenue from these loans has been increasing faster than the overall growth of the company and has Square looking more like a bank every day.

These days, one of the biggest concerns that analysts voice about Square is the time that Mr. Dorsey has to spend on Twitter, with all its problems.

During a talk at Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum in August, Mr. Dorsey said he thought he had proved that he didn’t need to make a choice between the two.

“They both have different needs and are in different phases,” he said. “Focusing on one thing doesn’t mean you completely lose sight of something else.”","Square, the Twitter Boss’s Other Company, Could Pass It in Value",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/jack-dorsey-twitter-square.html

“It’s horrifying,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a heroin researcher and a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s not even the magnitude — it’s the steepness at which it’s climbing.” Preliminary numbers for 2017 suggest that overdose deaths are growing at a rate comparable to the height of the H.I.V. epidemic.

The opioid epidemic has not fallen equally on all races or regions. Like an infectious disease, drug overdoses have emerged in clusters around the country.

Among those 15 to 44 — the age group in which drug overdose accounts for the greatest share of deaths — there are vast differences across racial categories and between urban and rural places. Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.

The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.

“It just blew through all the measures we’d been taking,” said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn’t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there’s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug’s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.

The illicit fentanyls being added to the heroin supply also vary widely in purity and quality. This unpredictability kills: Users often don’t realize the strength of what they’re taking until it’s too late.

An evolving epidemic

The country's struggles with opioids go back centuries, but the current epidemic has roots in the 1980s, when a few studies made doctors less wary of prescribing opioids for pain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers began aggressively marketing them for many ailments, particularly after OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid, hit the market in 1996. Soon, narcotics that had been reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care found their way into medicine cabinets across the country.

Michael Botticelli, the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and former White House drug czar, said that rampant over-prescription of painkillers had actually been decreasing in the last few years. “We’d turned a corner on that,” Mr. Botticelli said, “but we’ve seen the continued escalation of overdose deaths in many states.”

Some experts argue that the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, undertaken when addiction treatment was insufficient, pushed people toward heroin and inadvertently drove up the rate of overdose deaths. Mr. Botticelli said that theory isn’t supported by the data.

Regardless of the cause, there is little disagreement that heroin addiction has evolved into a full-fledged crisis of its own. “Young people are flocking to heroin,” Dr. Ciccarone said. Halting prescription opioid abuse will probably not be enough to stop the growing number of deaths.

What can be done

The Trump administration has established a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study responses to the epidemic. The commission’s final report is expected in November.

Among public health researchers, there is broad agreement about what's needed: access to addiction treatment and medications; tighter regulation of prescription opioids; widespread distribution of naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote; needle exchanges or supervised injection centers; and law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, the bulk of which is thought to come from China and Mexico.

“This is not a hopeless situation,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., describing interdiction as a critical piece of the strategy. “If law enforcement can substantially interfere with the supply of illicit opioids, it will save a lot of lives.”

He and other experts expressed hope for new partnerships between law enforcement and public health. Cooperation would, for example, allow public health workers to pinpoint groups of drug users who may be amenable to treatment or identify particularly deadly batches of drugs before they kill.",You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html

I thought I had only minutes to live.” Maryam, 16 “They brought out a belt and tied it to my waist and showed me a button to press.” Nana, 13

The New York Times interviewed 18 girls who were captured by militants in Nigeria and sent into crowds to blow themselves up. Here are their stories.

The girls didn’t want to kill anyone. They walked in silence for a while, the weight of the explosives around their waists pulling down on them as they fingered the detonators and tried to think of a way out.

“I don’t know how to get this thing off me,” Hadiza, 16, recalled saying as she headed out on her mission.

“What are you going to do with yours?” she asked the 12-year-old girl next to her, who was also wearing a bomb.

“I’m going to go off by myself and blow myself up,” the girl responded hopelessly.

It was all happening so fast. After being kidnapped by Boko Haram this year, Hadiza was confronted by a fighter in the camp where she was being held hostage. He wanted to “marry” her. She rejected him.

“You’ll regret this,” the fighter told her.

A few days later, she was brought before a Boko Haram leader. He told her she would be going to the happiest place she could imagine. Hadiza thought she was going home. He was talking about heaven.

They came for her at night, she said, grabbing a suicide belt and attaching it to her waist. The fighters then sent her and the 12-year-old girl out on foot, alone, telling them to detonate the bombs at a camp for Nigerian civilians who have fled the violence Boko Haram has inflicted on the region.

“I knew I would die and kill other people, too,” Hadiza recalled. “I didn’t want that.”

Northeastern Nigeria, now in its eighth year of war with Boko Haram, has become a place afraid of its own girls.

So far this year, militants have carried out more than twice as many suicide bombings than they did in all of 2016, and the attacks keep coming.

According to Unicef, more than 110 children have been used as suicide bombers since the start of the year – at least 76 of them girls. Most were under 15 years old. One girl blew herself up along with a baby strapped to her back.

Bombers here at the center of the battle against Boko Haram have struck mosques, marketplaces, checkpoints, camps for displaced civilians and anywhere else people gather, including a single polo field attacked multiple times. Trenches have been dug around the University of Maiduguri, a frequent bombing target, in hopes of slowing down attackers.

“I knew very well that bomb would kill me.” Maimuma, 14

The deployment of children has become so frighteningly common that officials in the areas where Boko Haram operates are warning citizens to be on the lookout for girl bombers. A huge billboard here in Maiduguri – the Nigerian city where Boko Haram was born – proclaims “Stop Terrorism” with the image of a scowling, wild-eyed girl with explosives on her chest, clutching a detonator.

Officials are publicly urging parents not to hand over their children to Boko Haram for use as bombers, while the military is circulating a video telling bombers they can surrender. It features an 11-year-old girl.

“Do not allow them to tie explosives on you,” says the girl in the video. “It is dangerous.”

The public service ad paints bombers and their families as Boko Haram collaborators who either support the militants’ campaign of terror, or were brainwashed or drugged into doing so.

But The New York Times tracked down and interviewed 18 girls in Nigeria who were sent on suicide missions by Boko Haram. Their accounts shatter the narrative often perpetuated by officials.

Far from having been willing participants, the girls described being kidnapped and held hostage, with family members killed during their capture.

All of the girls recounted how armed militants forcibly tied suicide belts to their waists, or thrust bombs into their hands, before pushing them toward crowds of people. Most were told that their religion compelled them to carry out the orders. And all of them resisted, preventing the attacks by begging ordinary citizens or the authorities to help them.

Aisha, 15, fled her home with her father and 10-year-old brother, but Boko Haram caught them. The fighters killed her father and, soon after, she watched them strap a bomb to her brother, squeeze him between two militants on a motorbike and speed away.

The two militants returned without him, cheering. Her little brother had blown up soldiers at a barracks, she learned. The militants told her not to cry for him. “He killed wicked people,” they told her.

Later, they tied a bomb on her, too, instructing her to head toward the same barracks.

Like some of the other girls, Aisha said she had considered walking off to an isolated spot and pressing the detonator, far from other people, to avoid hurting anyone else. Instead, she approached the soldiers and persuaded them to remove the explosives from her body, delicately.

“I told them, ‘My brother was here and killed some of your men,’” she said. “My brother wasn’t sensible enough to know he didn’t have to do it. He was only a small child.”

Other girls, whose full names are also being withheld out of concern for their security, had similar stories of terror and defiance.

Fall on your tummy, face down, the militants told Fatima A., 17. But when she approached soldiers, she put up her hands and yelled at the top of her voice: “Look! I’m innocent! I’m not part of them! They forced me!”

“They told me that by the grace of God I’ll succeed.” Maimuma, 14 “I was so afraid it would explode on its own.” Falmata B., 15 “They told me to go to the big mosque and sit among the worshippers.” Fati, 14 “I can’t kill people, especially innocent people.” Falmata S., 16

Amina, 16, was told to blow up worshipers at a mosque. But as she drew near the crowd, she spotted her uncle, who helped her to safety.

Wait until you find a big crowd of civilians, fighters told Hajja, 17. But if you spot just one or two soldiers first, press the button, they instructed her. Instead, when she came upon a soldier, she showed him her bomb. He guided her to an open field, where he gently removed it.

Fati, 14, was deployed along with nine other girls, each sent in different directions to hit separate targets. She walked into a police station to ask for help, holding the bag containing the bomb that militants had given her. The officers screamed and ran out, she said. But eventually they returned, telling her to leave the bag in a nearby field and walk away.

Maryam, 16, said she got help from an old man resting under a tree. The two hollered to one another from a safe distance, so that he could question her first and get some assurances that she didn’t plan to blow him up.

For these girls and others, even approaching the authorities to ask for help was exceedingly dangerous. Soldiers and civilians at checkpoints are on high alert for anyone suspicious – and usually that means any woman or girl, most of whom wear long head scarves and garments that could cover an explosive belt. In just the last three months of 2016, the United Nations says, 13 children from 11 to 17 years old were killed after they were wrongly thought to be suicide bombers.

Most of the girls interviewed said, like Hadiza, that they had been deployed as bombers after refusing to be married off to a fighter. For years Boko Haram fighters have forced girls into “marriage,” a euphemism for rape, sometimes impregnating them.

Many of the girls echoed Hadiza’s account, saying the militants had promised them paradise in exchange for pushing a red detonator button. The girls, nearly all involved in planned attacks within the past year, were dropped off along empty roads as gun-toting fighters stayed back at a distance to watch them walk toward their targets.

Maimuma, 14, whom militants told to bomb a group of soldiers, said she didn’t want to become like the dozens of other girls who have blown themselves up, taking bystanders with them. She knows that many people suspect she is a Boko Haram collaborator. But she argues that she and other girls like her should be praised for defying the militants.

“Some people see me as part of Boko Haram,” she said. “Some people see me as a hero.”

“I get afraid when I see women.” Hassan, a member of a local civilian militia

In recent months, Nigeria’s gains in beating back Boko Haram – retaking territory and capturing militant hide-outs – have begun to recede. The group’s fighters have launched not only more suicide bombings but more tactical strikes against security forces as well.

In June, they attacked a convoy of soldiers and police officers, kidnapping several female police officers. The following month, militants fired on a military-escorted convoy of oil workers, killing more than 25 people and kidnapping geologists from the University of Maiduguri.

Western intelligence officials say the militants have been recapturing land that the Nigerian military took from them. The United States is preparing to sell half a billion dollars’ worth of attack planes and other material to Nigeria to aid the fight.

The humanitarian situation in the region is dire, with nearly two million people across four countries displaced by war and some living in famine-like conditions. Maiduguri is overwhelmed by families that have fled rural farms and fisheries with no means of making a living. Many live in decaying buildings and thatched huts, or along the banks of the shallow Ngadda River, where one small group survives on roasted scraps of cow hide discarded by local tanneries.

Now, aid groups are fighting an outbreak of thousands of cases of cholera, according to humanitarian workers.

The relentless string of bombings in recent months, mostly around Maiduguri and across the border in Cameroon, has cast a frightening shadow over life here. On Sunday alone, more than a dozen people were killed when bombers struck.

In the past six years, women have accounted for the majority of suicide bombings by Boko Haram in northeast Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad, according to a report released in August by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.

In fact, the report said, the group has deployed more female bombers than any other terrorist group in history.

And as Boko Haram increasingly turns to children to carry out its suicide attacks, it is four times more likely to deploy girl bombers than boys, the report found.

“There is an uneasiness – people often mention their fear of women and girls at checkpoints, in crowded areas, at the camps, at the university,” said Harriet Dwyer, a spokeswoman for Unicef in Maiduguri. “As we see these incidences happening with more frequency, the stigma and the suspicion become a very difficult thing to reconcile.”

The bombings are taking a psychological toll on Maiduguri, a city that by some estimates has doubled in population as families flee Boko Haram in the countryside.

Bombers strike repeatedly at busy marketplaces and camps for the displaced. Residents suspect that the university has been a frequent target because of Boko Haram’s hatred of Western education, one of its founding principles. At least eight attacks on the university have occurred since the start of the year.

The suicide bombers usually operate in the early morning hours, predictably enough that many residents start their days later or avoid certain areas altogether. Worried about being shot by mistake, many women and girls squat before approaching checkpoints, hoping to convince nervous soldiers and civilian militia members that they aren’t wearing explosive belts or vests.

To avoid suspicion, some women say that they are careful to bathe and wash their clothes frequently. Most of the girls used in bombings have lived in harsh conditions in the bush and appear dirty and “haggard,” a word many residents use to describe them.

One Maiduguri resident, Fatima Seidu, 45, said that whenever she saw girls on the street, she crossed to avoid them.

“I get afraid of bombs, and afraid someone will see me and get afraid of me,” said Ms. Seidu, whose husband was killed by Boko Haram. “But hopefully they’ll look at my age and they’ll also see I’m wearing clean clothes.”

Hassan, a member of a local civilian militia, said that when women and girls approach his checkpoint, he tells them to drop what they’re carrying. Several months ago, he said, a woman refused to stop when he shouted at her. He watched as she raised her hand and pressed a detonator, setting off a bomb.

“I get afraid when I see women,” he said.

“They told me to be sure I was ready for heaven.” Amina, 16 “I pitied the women and the children at my target.” Balaraba, 20 “It’s tied on my body. I’m afraid to touch it.” Hadiza B., 13 “They told me to blow up a hospital, to go in the mix of patients and workers and detonate a bomb.” Maimuna, 16

Hassan’s wife, Fatima G., 19, said she had been abducted by Boko Haram, held for about six months, and forced to marry a fighter. One day, militants gathered a group of women hostages and told them to parade before them as they barked orders. It seemed to be some kind of test for obedience, she said.

Not long after, she said, a fighter put her on the back of a motorbike and sped toward Maiduguri. On the way, he told her she was going on a suicide mission. But they came upon a firefight between militants and soldiers instead. In the chaos, she escaped.

Now, in her daily life in Maiduguri, she is fearful of women. “It’s not like anyone is wearing identification,” she said. “There’s no way to know who is who.”

The girls who were sent on suicide missions now try to blend into teenage life in Maiduguri. Most had painted nails, tiny rhinestone studs in their noses and curls of henna on their feet. Their long headscarves covered patterned or sparkly dresses and braided hair.

Nearly all had their schooling interrupted by the war. They are eager to return. They dream of becoming teachers, doctors or lawyers.

They value their religion and say they were unconvinced by Boko Haram’s insistence that Islam supports suicide bombings. Some worry that God would have punished them had they accidentally set off the bombs attached to them.

In most cases, the girls told no one about their missions, other than the security forces who helped them. Some girls did not even tell their parents, frightened of being rejected. Those who did were told not to repeat their stories, for fear they would be labeled Boko Haram sympathizers.

The militants sometimes tried to trick the girls, hoping to convince them they would not be harmed in the attacks. Maimuma was told that the moment she hit the detonator, the bomb would leap from her body and land in the crowd. She didn’t believe it, especially after militants prepared her hair in a traditional burial style.

“I knew very well that bomb would kill me,” she said.

But there was little she could do. They tied an explosive belt around her waist and dropped her along a road. Follow it to where the soldiers are, they told her. Act like a woman, they said. Look attractive. Wait until you’re very close to them. Then press the button.

She tried to keep her composure until she was out of sight. The explosives were heavy and the detonator – a device that looked like a small radio – was hot against her waist, she recalled. She wanted to remove the belt, but was terrified of accidentally setting it off.

She began to cry. Some passers-by spotted her sobbing on the road and approached. She told them Boko Haram had tied a bomb under her gown. They sprinted away. Others approached, but they too fled when she told them her problem.

“They came one after another,” she said, almost laughing at the grim absurdity of the scene. “I tried to run after them and they told me they would kill me if I kept coming.”

After a few minutes, a group of soldiers arrived, telling her to keep her distance and put her hands in the air. A soldier came over to gingerly remove the device. It seemed to take forever. Her arms grew tired as she held them overhead. Finally, the belt was off.

Initially, Maimuma hid the episode from her family and friends, and she worried about being jailed if people found out. “Then I thought to myself, ‘Why should I be arrested for being forced to carry a bomb?’” she said. “I decided I was going tell everyone.”

When Maimuma hears about girls who set off bombs she is frustrated. There’s no question in her mind that they had no loyalty to Boko Haram. She thinks they were naïve, terrified and ultimately foolish for not realizing they had the option of surrendering to security officials, she said.

But that is risky, too. When Hadiza and the 12-year-old girl approached a checkpoint, she was scared of what the soldiers might do. Hadiza told the younger girl to wait by a tree in the distance while she explained their predicament to the soldiers. She knew the girl would raise suspicion because she was too young to be walking in the bush without a parent.

“She was such a small girl,” Hadiza said.

The soldiers believed her and helped the girls take off their explosives belts before splitting them up for questioning. Hadiza was eventually taken to a camp for displaced people. She still doesn’t know where her mother is, or if she is even alive. But her father showed up at the camp a few weeks after she did. When she told him what happened, he cried, both horrified and relieved.

“He would never reject me,” she said. “He was so happy I survived.”",Boko Haram strapped suicide bombs to them. Somehow these teenage girls survived.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/25/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-suicide-bomb.html

General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, reported a third-quarter loss of $3 billion on Tuesday, stemming primarily from a large accounting charge for the sale of its European operations.

Here are highlights of the G.M. announcement:

• The company said it took a $5.4 billion charge related to unrealized tax assets and pension costs associated with the sale of its Opel and Vauxhall divisions to the European automaker PSA Group.

• G.M. also said that its pretax income in North America fell 42 percent from a year earlier to about $2.1 billion, as it reduced production at several plants to account for lower sales of some vehicles and changeovers to new products.

• A year ago, the company earned $2.8 billion in the third quarter.

• G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the quarter reflected “solid results,” as the automaker continued its transition away from underperforming international markets such as Europe, and focused more resources on new technology such as electric-powered and self-driving vehicles.

• Investors reacted positively to the earnings report, with shares up 4 percent in premarket trading. G.M. has the highest valuation of American automakers.","General Motors Posts a Loss From Asset Sale, but Shares Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/general-motors-earnings.html

But after the Yankees were eliminated last weekend, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi.
He largely absolved Girardi for leading the Yankees to just one playoff appearance — a wild-card berth in 2015 — since the previous one, in 2012.
“Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?
Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadn’t made the playoffs in two to three years?","That Yankees team, with so many players who had not been tested, exceeded most expectations this season and chased the Red Sox to the next to last day of the regular season for the division title. Ultimately, the Yankees settled for a wild-card berth before embarking on an inspiring run to the cusp of the World Series.

Girardi’s unrelenting manner — be it his rigorous preparation, his unwillingness to concede any cause or his sometimes contentious back and forth with the news media — was reflected in this club, which staged numerous comebacks this season and then twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short in the second instance.

But it was during the postseason run that Girardi came under fierce criticism for his managing. In the Yankees’ Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, he declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call by the plate umpire — a decision that helped open the doors for a decisive Indians comeback.

Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day — “I screwed up,” he said repeatedly at a news conference — was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games against the Indians to advance to the A.L.C.S. against the Houston Astros.

Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after Game 2 seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that he might not necessarily want to return as manager in 2018.

And last Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.

“I’ve had 10 great years here,” he said. “I feel extremely blessed. God has been good to me, and we’ll see what the future holds.”

Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship for the last decade. Though they rarely socialized together, they spoke almost daily during the season.

“I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him,” Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season. “There’s an openness that is encouraged here. I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes you’ll have disagreements on players’ capabilities that I’ve acquired or strategies that he’s employing.

“You’ve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and I’m proud to say we have that,’’ Cashman added.

But after the Yankees were eliminated last weekend, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi.

“I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short,” he said.

At a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued — the new managers of the Yankees’ two rivals, Mickey Callaway of the Mets and Alex Cora of the Red Sox, are viewed as strong communicators — Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front. He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchez’s inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi in the past.

And in the wake of Girardi’s botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman “liked’’ a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back. Chapman later said he inadvertently “liked” the post.

Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Joe Torre as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994. But after a lavish spending spree, the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series — the 27th in franchise history — in a new stadium.

That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi. He switched to No. 28 — from No. 27 — because he continued to want a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees have accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.

But with players who were the foundation of their championship years — Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera — aging and retiring, the Yankees were unable to win another under Girardi’s leadership.

In an interview before the start of the season, the Yankees’ principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, said that the team had not developed enough talent in recent years. He largely absolved Girardi for leading the Yankees to just one playoff appearance — a wild-card berth in 2015 — since the previous one, in 2012.

“What did I look at?” Steinbrenner said. “Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi? Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadn’t made the playoffs in two to three years? Had he lost control of the team? Did the players no longer respect him? Is it a serious situation in that regard? And the answer to that in my opinion was no.”

Steinbrenner added: “So, I try to be a pretty even-keeled thinker. I’m objective. That’s my nature. That’s the way I come to decisions. There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still aren’t winning. So how well does that work? I don’t know. I’ve got to take a look at any renewal of a contract with any employee and do the best I can to analyze it. Is this person the right fit? Or is this person being detrimental to the organization?”

Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family. He skipped a game this season at Tampa Bay to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he has made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives. Girardi’s son, a sophomore in high school and a baseball player, occasionally works out with Yankees coaches before games.

Girardi, who had a four-year, $16 million contract, said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning. Girardi said he wanted to understand how the grind of the baseball season impacted his children and his wife.

“I’m not living my kids’ lives; I’m not living my wife’s life,” Girardi said during the playoffs. “I’m living, in a sense, my life, so I don’t know what changes for them.”

Now, however, much has changed for Girardi. He is no longer the Yankees’ manager.",Joe Girardi Is Out as Yankees’ Manager,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/baseball/joe-girardi-fired-yankees.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

The books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

However, McCain ran for president in 2008 with Sarah Palin as a running mate and that should count for something.

Trump, of course, spent much of his career pretending to be himself before the cameras. That’s the thing about reality TV — it’s actually happening, but you’re also making it up. Jeff Flake and his buddy were alone on the desert island with a camera crew. And, according to some reports, the producers decided who to fire on “The Apprentice.”

The president tends to be extremely agreeable when he’s playing chief executive at meetings. He had a gathering with Republicans to talk about tax cuts and received a standing ovation. “I called it a love fest,” Trump said later. This is the same guy who got along super-well with some Democratic senators at a dinner not too long ago. They discussed taxes, too, and agreed about everything.

But nothing’s necessarily going to last once people leave the room. This week Trump tweeted a denunciation of any Republican tax bill that would modify the popular 401(k) program, vowing, “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” On Wednesday he said it was something his party could use for “negotiating.”

This is a man whose strong suit is supposed to be deal making?

Early in this presidency, optimists believed that when Trump suddenly veered wildly from one position to another it was because of canny tactics. Now optimists believe that he’s just … really forgetful.

It’s tough, as everybody knows, to come to a bipartisan agreement on anything in Washington these days. Way harder than when Jeff Flake was trying to get milk from a coconut with Martin Heinrich. Now, if the two parties are ready to come together, they can’t be sure the president won’t rewrite the script and denounce them for betraying the middle class.

I know many of you are exhausted with the continuous wave of crazy-person stories pouring out of the White House. Perhaps you would feel better if you believed that Donald Trump does not so much lie as re-run reality on a different camera. He said this week that he was “extremely nice” to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, one of the four soldiers killed in Niger. Myeshia Johnson said that the president was unfeeling and appeared not to know her husband’s name.

Trump claimed he got all the names right because he has “one of the great memories of all time.” It is possible that’s the way he recalls the scene. In the real world, he seems to naturally say things that are off-kilter. And there are possibly days that he calls his oldest daughter “SriLanka.” Or “Mary Sue.”

While there have been some widely cited examples of egregious behavior — the editor in chief of a right-wing tabloid said Ms. Argento “must have liked it” — these are exceptions. The bulk of the Italian press has been on Ms. Argento’s side. It has, rightly, treated her gently: The newspaper La Stampa published a 2,000- word interview with her, in which she denied that she’d maintained a five-year relationship with Mr. Weinstein; the interviewer never challenged her on this revision. Prominent male columnists have come to Ms. Argento’s defense — this, in a country that has a total of zero national newspapers edited by women and zero female columnists in its main national papers.

Where the reaction to Ms. Argento’s story has been truly vicious has been on social media. And there, it has primarily come from women.

There was the woman who wouldn’t believe Ms. Argento because she did not find her likable when she was competing on “Dancing With the Stars”; the one that claims “Asia asked for it” because she once filmed a scene in which she French-kissed a dog; the one who says — as if it matters — “I’ve simply never liked her.” (I won’t link to the likes of them here.)

What this tells us about Italian feminism isn’t clear, but it’s certainly ugly.

There’s something under-ripened about the state of feminism in my country. In other countries, to proclaim oneself a feminist is taken to mean that you are a person who defends the rights of women to live as they like, to have equal rights and opportunities, and to be in charge of their sexuality. In Italy, those who call themselves feminists treat what is supposed to be a fundamental component of one’s worldview as a sort of battle between high-school cliques: I will fight for your rights — as long as we’re friends. If a sexual assault victim has been unfriendly, we will side with the next one, the one who answers our phone calls. Our sympathies are determined not by who has suffered but by who has invited us to her dinner parties.

I’ve seen this face of Italian “feminism” before, in other episodes, and it has a genuinely stifling quality. A continuing public debate, for instance, over whether surrogacy should stay illegal in Italy — a topic worthy of serious, engaged discussion — long ago devolved into something more like a catfight. In the case of Ms. Argento, there are plenty of real discussions to be had: about the line between a relationship gone wrong and harassment, about the statute of limitations, about power plays and workplace relationships. We are not having those discussions.

Perhaps it has something to do with the broader place of women in Italian public life, where there’s a sense that we have to fight for scraps; there’s only room for one sort of feminism here, and it’s mine (or my friends’). Surely it’s no coincidence that the most significant Italian author of the past few years is Elena Ferrante, whose Neapolitan novels series, in the words of the scholar Tiziana de Rogatis, illustrates “the terrible amalgam of envy and elective recognition which inevitably constitutes the friendship between two women, two subservients in search of their emancipation.”

Or perhaps it has to do with — Italian cliché though it may be — our history with the Mafia. Our attitude toward life mimics the Corleone family’s: Our family, our friends, our clique will always come before abstract concepts of right and wrong. It’s a variation on “the devil you know”: The patriarchy you know will always be more appealing than a triumphant feminism in which none of your acquaintances are involved.

In 1902, an 11-year-old girl named Maria Goretti, the daughter of a farming family living outside of Rome, was approached by a neighbor with a knife, who threatened to rape her. Rather than submit, she let herself be stabbed to death. The Roman Catholic Church made her a saint. Sometimes it seems she’s the ideal paradigm for Italian feminism today: The only woman everyone here can agree is a victim is the one who got herself killed.

But American citizens have been footing the bill for members of President Trump’s cabinet to crisscross the world on government planes.

So far, the fallout has been fierce: At least five cabinet secretaries are under review by inspectors general for their taxpayer-funded travels, and the House Oversight Committee is reviewing all travel by senior administration officials.

The travel of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came under the scrutiny of the inspector general in August. While previous Treasury secretaries have been known to use military planes for overseas trips, they have generally flown commercial for domestic travel because of the exorbitant costs of operating government jets.

As a practice, Timothy F. Geithner, President Obama’s first Treasury secretary, flew commercially, always in coach, when traveling domestically, Jenni LeCompte, who served as Mr. Geithner’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said on Wednesday.

Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and a onetime Hollywood film financier, appears to break tradition. For example, it cost taxpayers $172,283 for Mr. Mnuchin to fly to Florida, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia on a military plane. It could have cost $3,402 — about 50 times less — if he had flown commercial.

Total 172,283 3,402 The price shown is the highest for booking a coach seat on expedia.com for a next-day trip in late October. Round-trip flights originated in Washington, D.C., except where noted.

Mr. Mnuchin has flown on commercial flights and has used Amtrak “a couple of times over the past several months,” according to a Treasury spokeswoman.

But this month, the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General reported that since March Mr. Mnuchin had used military aircraft for seven trips — four domestic and three overseas — for a total cost of more than $800,000. Flying commercial on all seven trips would cost at most about $22,700.

Total 631,959 19,265 The price shown is the highest for booking a coach seat on expedia.com for a next-day trip in late October. All flights were round trips from Washington, D.C.

There are a few reasons that government officials take military flights. In Mr. Mnuchin’s case, he has said that his requests for government aircraft were made in the interest of national security — military aircraft are equipped to handle secure communications for officials in flight.

Other Trump administration officials, like Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, have taken military or chartered flights because they had scheduling conflicts or commercial flights were not available to their destinations.

Tom Price, the former health secretary, resigned after racking up at least $400,000 in chartered flight fees.

It is usually the White House’s duty to approve a military flight when a cabinet member requests one, in large part because the trips are so expensive. But the inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin’s flights by the inspector general revealed that both White House and Treasury officials failed to meet the normally rigorous standards to get the costly flights approved.

“What is of concern is a disconnect between the standard of proof called for” by White House guidance “and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests,” according to a memo submitted this month by Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general.

It cost more than $26,000 to operate the plane for the round-trip flight Mr. Mnuchin took in August to visit Louisville and Fort Knox in Kentucky. The trip attracted attention after Mr. Mnuchin’s wife, Louise Linton, posted on Instagram a photo of herself disembarking a military jet.

As tall and commanding in a suit as he was in a uniform, Mr. Kelly has become a central figure in Mr. Trump’s orbit. After six months in the cabinet as secretary of homeland security, Mr. Kelly took over a turbulent and tribal White House last summer and by most accounts imposed more order on the building and staff, if not the Twitter-obsessed president himself.

Mr. Kelly’s focus on improving information flow and decision making in the West Wing gave the impression of a good soldier mainly concerned with process. But that obscured a player who expresses his own sharp views in selected areas, most notably immigration, where he shares Mr. Trump’s commitment to toughening the border and deporting many in the country illegally. His views were forged in part by his time heading the United States Southern Command, which oversees American military operations and security in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.

Mr. Kelly not only expressed willingness to curb refugees coming into the country — in the end, Mr. Trump lowered the cap to 45,000 — he embraced Mr. Trump’s various attempts to close the border to visitors from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. He aggressively turned up the heat on internal immigration enforcement, stepping up deportation of undocumented immigrants, even those without serious criminal records, reversing an Obama administration policy.

Under Mr. Kelly’s leadership, the Department of Homeland Security also went after undocumented parents who bring their children into the country. He directed immigration officials to lodge smuggling charges against the parents, saying they were putting children in danger.

“Kelly has been an enabler of Trump’s mission,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant homeland security secretary under Mr. Obama. “Judge him that way.”

His image as a steady, nonideological figure trying to restore order in the White House in the face of a radical president, she added, was not true. Mr. Kelly, she said, was not “the savior or the hostage.”

Other Democrats have expressed alarm at Mr. Kelly’s views on immigration. At a dinner including Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Kelly gave an extended critique of Mexico, calling it a third-world country in danger of collapsing the way Venezuela has and arguing that the United States needed to guard itself against that, according to people informed about the conversation.

But Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who recommended Mr. Kelly to Mr. Trump last winter, said the retired general’s background gave him an understanding of the dangers and drawbacks of unfettered immigration. “He knows a lot of the challenges that we face south of the border,” Mr. Cotton said, adding that the issue is “something that he’s lived on a firsthand basis for years.”

Like Mr. Panetta, he pointed to Mr. Kelly’s upbringing.

“I think he appreciates the struggles of America’s working class — the blue-collar workers over the last 30, 40 years, the kind of people who have to take a shower after they get off work, not before they go to work — and the impact that mass unskilled and low-skilled immigration has had on working-class wages in our society,” Mr. Cotton said.

As a cabinet officer, Mr. Kelly frequently lashed out at critics. In March, during a meeting with members of Arab and Muslim communities in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Kelly threatened to walk out after being posed hard questions about the travel ban and what participants saw as the targeting of Muslim Americans at ports of entry, according to people in attendance.

During a speech in April, Mr. Kelly rebuked members of Congress who complained about what they called overly aggressive immigration enforcement.

“If lawmakers do not like the laws they’ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws,” Mr. Kelly said defiantly. “Otherwise, they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.”

That drew a rebuke from Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “I don’t think it’s correct for you to tell members of Congress to shut up,” he said.

Mr. Kelly has also engaged in testy public debates with Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California. During a June meeting, Ms. Harris and Mr. Kelly engaged in a contentious back-and-forth as she questioned him about Trump administration threats to cut off funding for so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

All of that foreshadowed his attack last week on Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who publicly accused Mr. Trump of insensitivity when he called the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, who was killed this month in Niger. Mr. Kelly called her an “empty barrel” and told an unflattering story about her that was proved untrue by videotape of the event he mentioned.

Mr. Kelly decided himself to head out to the White House briefing room to defend the president, colleagues said, and most of his remarks reflected on his own experience as the father of a slain Marine and the nature of military service. He brought tears to the eyes of other White House aides, who afterward traded emails expressing admiration for Mr. Kelly’s passionate defense of Mr. Trump. It was only afterward that they began to see how the attack on Ms. Wilson came to overshadow the emotion of the first part of his speech.

Mr. Kelly was surprised by the criticism of his speech, colleagues said, but he has not apologized to Ms. Wilson for making false statements about her. White House officials said they opted against it to avoid extending the story.

Mr. Panetta said Mr. Kelly’s attack on a congresswoman reflected his lack of experience in high-level politics. “He knows where the land mines are in the Marines, but he doesn’t know where the land mines are in politics,” Mr. Panetta said. “And he’ll make mistakes as a result, and he certainly made mistakes last week in going after people in that news conference.”

But, he said, it was authentic: “As somebody who worked with this guy, a lot of what he got up to say is a reflection of who John Kelly is.”","Pitched as Calming Force, John Kelly Instead Mirrors Boss’s Priorities",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/trump-kelly.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Now, if you’re a United States senator, that’s a good place to find yourself.”

“He’s very popular in my state,” Mr. Graham continued. “When I help him, it helps me back home. And I think it probably helps him to be able to do business with an old rival who’s seen as a deal maker.”

To Republican critics of Mr. Trump, Mr. Graham is risking his reputation with such a calculus.

“Lindsey Graham knows better,” said Peter Wehner, who advised former President George W. Bush and is a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times. “Deep in his heart, he must know that Donald Trump is fundamentally unfit to be president, and he has to pretend that Trump is. And when you engage in a game like that, there’s often a cost to it.”

Mr. Graham is willing to take the risk. Twice in the last two weeks, he has been the president’s golf partner. (Mr. Trump is better, he says.) There have been one-on-one huddles in the Oval Office. And two days before the series of phone calls last week, Mr. Trump brought Mr. Graham along for a 15-minute helicopter flight from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the White House after a trip aboard Air Force One.

Few people ever get to join the president on Marine One. Likely no one has been invited to fly as a guest aboard the presidential helicopter after calling the commander in chief “the world’s biggest jackass,” as Mr. Graham once said of Mr. Trump. (Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the White House, responded by calling Mr. Graham “an idiot.”)

Somehow, though, a president who is famous for nursing grudges appears to have put the past behind him. And despite their differences — on immigration, race relations and isolationism — Mr. Trump and Mr. Graham have become Washington’s oddest odd couple, working together to repeal the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes and increase military spending.

“We have become friends while working to get health care and tax cuts for the American people,” Mr. Trump said in an email response to a question about their relationship. “Senator Graham is a fighter and a good person.”

That hasn’t always been Mr. Trump’s opinion of Mr. Graham. This summer, after the senator criticized the president’s comments about the racial violence in Virginia after the death of a protester, Heather Heyer, Mr. Trump lashed out.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists, and people like Ms. Heyer,” the president said on Twitter. “Such a disgusting lie. He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!”

Some Republicans said they were not entirely surprised by Mr. Graham’s embrace of the president.

“He’s being very pragmatic,” said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican consultant who is also an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s, adding that the senator was engaged in “a delicate dance.”

“I don’t give him any demerits on supporting him where they agree on policy,” Mr. Murphy said.

Health care has been one of those areas. Mr. Graham first opposed, then supported, the Senate’s unsuccessful effort to pass a narrow “skinny” repeal of the Affordable Care Act this summer. Frustrated and unwilling to give up, Mr. Graham used a private meeting in the Oval Office to urge support for a plan that relies on block grants to states.

When that plan stalled, the private meeting gave it new life, according to former Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has been helping develop the block grant proposal.

“We were getting nowhere until Lindsey met with Trump, and Trump said, ‘Hey, you’ve got to start working with these guys,’” Mr. Santorum recalled. “They were paying us lip service until Trump said, ‘Hey, I want this to happen.’ ‘As Lindsey got Trump more engaged, the White House got more engaged.”

Mr. Graham said he was trying to help Mr. Trump turn his “message into legislative success,” adding: “I think what he sees in me is a guy that is willing to try to find a way to make something happen. I’m willing to do things that sometimes other Republicans won’t.”

But Mr. Wehner cautioned that Mr. Graham must be careful.

“There’s a rule of thumb when it comes to Donald Trump: Everybody who gets close to him or supportive of him in one way or another is stained by him,” he said. “I suspect that Lindsey Graham is going to find that out the hard way. He’ll be used.”

The senator insists he is frank with Mr. Trump when he disagrees with him. For instance, Mr. Trump wants to do away with the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires a 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation. Mr. Graham wants to keep it. “We argue about this all the time,” the senator said.

Looking ahead, Mr. Graham envisioned working with the president on issues as varied as an immigration overhaul — Mr. Trump has “credibility no one else has” — and a minimum-wage increase, which Mr. Graham says he intends to introduce when the Senate considers revamping the tax code. He said Mr. Trump “loved” the idea.

Mr. Graham’s Republican colleagues in the Senate, meanwhile, are keeping close watch on the newfound friendship.

“Lindsey and the president are the most interesting couple in Washington,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is Mr. Graham’s co-sponsor on the health care measure. “They kind of fuss with each other, and then they go play golf.”

Mr. Corker offered another possible reason for their bonding: “Lindsey’s fun!”

Mr. Graham says much the same about the president: “He’s a lot of fun. He’s just like me. He’s just a B.S. artist on the golf course.”","As Other Republican Senators Bolt, Lindsey Graham Cozies Up to Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-lindsey-graham-best-friends.html

Not long ago, a group of friends and I began reminiscing about memorable dinner parties we’d attended. Almost at once I was flooded with an overwhelming barrage of images. Like Proust, but more embarrassing. There was that time my hosts served an omelet topped with ice cream and old coffee grounds — oh, and we were in a treehouse. Or that memorable occasion on which I was asked to give my boss a birthday dinner, cut my fingertip off with a mandoline and served everyone with a bloody bandage. Or that fancy dinner I gave where a bunch of crashers showed up, smoked weed out of corncob pipes and then left, taking an entire homemade pie with them. I shouldn’t even mention my brief mania for giving “theme” dinners in which the theme was known only to me: the Prematurely Bald Men Party; the Dinner at Which Everyone’s Boyfriend Is Named Dave; the All-Strangers Spaghetti Gala. Perhaps the most memorable of all, though, was a dinner party I had when I was 18, mostly because it was the first I ever executed completely on my own. I feel, in a way, that it was formative and that all dinner parties since then have been influenced in some way by the events of that evening.

It was the summer before college, and I was living by myself at my grandparents’ summer house on Long Island. I was working two jobs: one as a clerk at an antiques shop and another as a waitress at a vegetarian restaurant. Despite — or because of — the fact that I didn’t really have any friends in the vicinity, I decided to give a dinner party. I guess the access to a kitchen went to my head; probably also the crumpled paper bag of tip money that I kept under my bed, which made me feel rich.

There were plenty of young people working at the restaurant, but they mostly thought I was uptight (I was), and my one appearance at an after-work bonfire had been a notable failure. (I spent a lot of time wandering around the dunes by myself.) I was friendly with two other outcasts: a part-time masseuse in her 40s who had an irritating habit of saying she had attended “a little school in Cambridge” and had lent me a Van Morrison mixtape, and a Hare Krishna who wore a monkey-shaped backpack, often believed customers were in love with her and swigged Southern Comfort in the walk-in refrigerator. I invited them both.

But Devenski struck out Puig to complete the victory after 4 hours 19 minutes, handing the Dodgers just their second loss of this postseason.

“It was probably as nerve-racking as it was in the stands as for everybody else,” Springer said. “When the last out is made you finally breathe.”

Two games may be a small sample size, yet one conclusion can be drawn in this series: These are two well-matched teams that have the potential to play more dramatic games like Game 2. Even the calmest of fans would have had trouble watching Wednesday’s game without fraying some nerves.

“Two teams that competed for 27 outs,” Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. “An emotional roller coaster.”

The teams will now fly to Houston with the best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece. They will return to action on Friday, with Houston’s Lance McCullers Jr., a hero of Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. against the Yankees, slated to start Game 3 opposite Yu Darvish of the Dodgers.

The unseasonably warm weather in Los Angeles — it was 93 degrees at first pitch — should have been a clue that no margin would be comfortable. Balls that might have normally died at the warning track turned into game-changing hits.

“Dodger Stadium is pretty famous for, at night, the ball not carrying,” said Verlander, who had pitched brilliantly this postseason. “Doesn’t seem like the case the last couple of nights.”

Verlander, staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to Alex Bregman’s single in the third inning, was mowing through the Dodgers lineup with ease early on. But with two out in the fifth inning, Verlander gave up his first hit to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, who tied the score at 1-1 with his first major league home run since July 26.

Seager provided what felt a decisive blow an inning later. Seager, last year’s National League Rookie of the Year, hurt his back in the Dodgers’ division series against the Arizona Diamondbacks and missed the entire N.L.C.S.

With two outs in the sixth, Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor drew a walk, and then Seager smashed a go-ahead, two-run home run and screamed in delight.

Then the Astros proceeded to slowly chip away. Facing the Dodgers’ stout reliever Brandon Morrow in the eighth inning, Bregman smacked a ball down the right-field line that hit the edge of Puig’s glove as he dived for the ball. Puig, a strong defender, flung his glove into the ground in annoyance after the play.

Nursing a two-run lead, Roberts called for Jansen, his closer, for the kind of two-inning save Jansen has handled well.

This time was different. The second hitter Jansen faced, Correa, smacked an outside cutter up the middle for a run-scoring single that trimmed the Astros’ deficit to 3-2, snapping a streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings by the Dodgers bullpen.

“I’ll take Kenley any day of the week with a one-run lead going into the ninth inning,” Roberts said.

The next inning spelled more trouble for the Dodgers. Gonzalez was a key cog in the Astros’ season, yet he had not driven in a run since the first game of the division series. But he drilled a 94 m.p.h. cutter, Jansen’s trademark pitch, over the center-field wall for a game-tying blast.

It was the first earned run Jansen, the best closer in baseball, had allowed in the postseason since Game 3 of a division series in 2016.

“It was just flat,” Jansen said. “Give credit to Marwin Gonzalez. He didn’t miss the one pitch that was flat the whole night.”

In the top of the 10th, Altuve and Correa provided a 5-3 lead by feasting off Dodgers reliever Josh Fields, who had been used sparingly this postseason. Altuve brought chants of “M.V.P.” when he blasted a solo home run to left-center field to lead off the 10th inning.

Correa followed with his own shot, flipping his bat far into the air before he began his home run trot. The Astros’ dugout bounced up and down as the home crowd sat stunned.

“I loved it,” said Puig, who is well known for his own home run celebrations. “He threw it higher than I normally do, and that’s way you should play in the World Series.”

Puig replaced the Astros’ euphoria with anxiety when he hit a solo home run off Giles in the bottom of the 10th. Normally emphatic on the field, Puig simply placed his bat on the ground before running the bases.

With blood pressure high everywhere, Logan Forsythe drew a two-out walk and advanced to second base on a wild pitch. Hernandez then tied the game with a single, Forsythe beating Josh Reddick’s throw to home plate.

As if that were not enough drama, Hinch brought in Devenski. And before he threw a pitch, Devenski fired a pickoff attempt to second base, hoping to nab Hernandez. It was wide, and if it had not hit the umpire Laz Diaz, there might have been another play at the plate. Instead, it was a dead ball.

“Laz was perfectly positioned right where we wanted him,” Hinch said with a smirk after the game.

This all set the stage for a delirious 11th inning. McCarthy had not pitched since Oct. 1, and was making his postseason debut. He coughed up a single to Astros outfielder Cameron Maybin.

Up came Springer, who struck out four times in Game 1 but was determined to slow his heart rate down in this moment. He did, slamming a ball to right-center field for a two-run lead, and the Astros held on to win a game for the ages.",Astros Even World Series With Dodgers in a Home Run Derby,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/baseball/astros-world-series-game-2.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But the hardest decisions on how to mitigate the costs of the proposal have yet to be made.

The blueprint, as unveiled, would cost the Treasury more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to estimates by tax-writing experts. Now Congress must find a way to force those proposals into a $1.5 trillion budget hole.

Disagreements on how to do that have begun spilling into public view. In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, Mr. Trump and the House’s chief tax writer, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate issue.

Republicans hope that by the end of the year, they will be able to deliver to Mr. Trump the first significant revamping of the tax code since the Reagan administration, a feat that would show that unified Republican government can take on a big challenge and produce success.

But overhauling the tax code is an exceedingly difficult task, as evidenced by the decades that have passed since it was last achieved. And in the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Republican lawmakers already failed in their long-promised quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an outcome that makes the tax effort even more critical to the party’s fortunes.

The budget resolution approved Thursday, for the 2018 fiscal year, ostensibly maps out spending and revenue levels for the federal government. But its passage is meaningful largely because of the special procedures that it unlocks.

The budget measure contains parliamentary language that will shield a tax bill from a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, allowing it to pass with the approval of only 50 senators in a chamber where Republicans hold 52 seats. It also could pave the way for lawmakers to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.

In order to allow the tax effort to move along quickly, Republicans in the House agreed to pass the budget plan that the Senate approved last week.

The House had passed its own budget measure earlier this month, but by agreeing to the Senate plan rather than trying to meld the two documents, the timeline for passing a tax measure can be sped up.

In the end, the eagerness to tackle the tax overhaul ended up trumping other matters — including fiscal concerns that have been a central issue for many conservative Republicans.

For one thing, the House’s previous budget blueprint would have called for a more aggressive approach on cutting spending. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with legislation that would produce about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome.

But she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“Put simply, we have the opportunity to make history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three decades,” she said. “President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly.”

Democrats continued their drumbeat against the tax effort, warning that Republicans were preparing to cut taxes for the rich.

Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the budget measure was “not a real effort at responsible budgeting.”

Ms. Pearson said she was uncertain what such a large pool of money would pay for, but she said the asylum seekers’ safety would be difficult to ensure unless Australia made it more of a priority.

“Australia is walking away and leaving the P.N.G. government in charge, so when things go wrong, then P.N.G. will get the blame,” Ms. Pearson said, referring to Papua New Guinea. “But paying the P.N.G. government to take over operations on Manus doesn’t absolve Australia of its responsibilities to these men.”

Manus is one of two offshore centers where hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers from Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and several other countries have been housed for roughly four years, since being detained at sea while trying to reach Australia. The other center is on Nauru, a tiny island nation that is even more remote than Manus.

Supporters of Australia’s refusal to accept seaborne asylum seekers argue that it has significantly reduced the maritime trafficking of migrants in crowded, rickety boats, which has often led to deaths at sea. But the United Nations and several human rights groups have repeatedly criticized Australia for the harshness of its approach.

The Australian government has been trying for years to get other countries to accept the refugees. Officials say the Manus center is being closed because of a ruling last year by Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court, which determined that the detention of refugees and asylum seekers there was “illegal and unconstitutional.”

The United States had agreed to consider taking some of the refugees, under a deal reached near the end of President Barack Obama’s administration. President Trump called the agreement “dumb” soon after taking office. So far, only about 50 refugees have been relocated to the United States after extensive screening, about half of them from Manus and half from Nauru, according to Human Rights Watch.

With the Manus center’s closing looming, Australian immigration officials have been seeking alternatives. The government recently offered refugees on Manus a chance to move to Nauru, for example, while they wait to hear whether the United States will accept them. But only two refugees have expressed an interest in going.

Human Rights Watch investigators said that many of those on Manus were suffering from trauma, not just from experiences in their home countries but as a result of their detention, during which fellow asylum seekers have killed themselves or been beaten or killed.

“It’s hard to believe the situation could get worse, but the proposed shutdown of the main facility would expose the refugees and asylum seekers to even greater harm,” Ms. Pearson said.","Closing Manus Island Center Would Hurt Refugees, Australia Is Told",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/australia/australia-manus-refugees.html

WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices.

The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion.

But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google.

“The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,” Mr. Pai said.

The last of the documents were required to be released 25 years after the law was signed, but the incumbent president, in this case Mr. Trump, can order some withheld in response to concerns by the intelligence agencies. White House officials said he had not made up his mind whether to do so.

Historians and conspiracy investigators are eager to see what the documents may yet reveal about Lee Harvey Oswald and any ties he may have had to the Cubans, Soviets, C.I.A., F.B.I. or mafia. Some hope for a better understanding of Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban Consulate in the weeks before the assassination at Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.

Still, some specialists on the killing warned against expecting any stunning revelation. “I don’t think it will turn the case on its head,” said Gerald Posner, author of “Case Closed,” the 1993 book that concluded that Oswald indeed killed Kennedy on his own.

“We’re not going to find some secret memo from J. Edgar Hoover drawing out the escape path for Lee Harvey Oswald,” he said. “The public expectations are very high — they’ve heard about secret files, they know they’ve been locked up for all these years. The average person may think there’s a bombshell in there.”

But Mr. Posner said the files might draw a fuller picture of the early 1960s beyond the specific questions about the assassination. “This is all about the Cold War and spooks and spies and Mexico City,” he said. “This is about a time when we know the government was in league with the mob to kill Castro. Cold War scholars and historians may find this as interesting as Kennedy assassination researchers.”

According to the archives, 88 percent of the documents in the collection created by the 1992 law have been released in full and another 11 percent have been released with portions redacted. Just 1 percent have been withheld in full until now. Most have remained secret because they were declared “not assassination related” or “not believed relevant.” Officials said many of those were documents created as late as the 1990s to describe how intelligence collection worked.

Jefferson Morley, an author who spent years suing the C.I.A. for documents related to the Kennedy assassination, said he thought it likely that Mr. Trump would defer to some agency demands and withhold a portion of the archive. But he said he nonetheless hoped it would answer some questions for researchers that linger after nearly 54 years.

“There won’t be any smoking gun,” said Mr. Morley, editor of the assassination website JFKfacts.org, who re-examined the period for his new book, “The Ghost: The Secret Life of C.I.A. Spymaster James Jesus Angleton.” “But it will fill in the picture of the pre-assassination surveillance of Oswald,” especially during his visit to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City.

Mr. Morley said that the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. were well aware of Oswald, a former defector to the Soviet Union, before the killing. “The idea that Oswald came out of the blue and shot the president is false,” he said. “The C.I.A. had a deep file on him.”

Mr. Morley also said that with the potential release of what may total more than 100,000 pages, no one should expect instant answers on what they contained. “There will be good stuff in there, but you’re not going to find it in the first two hours,” he said.

He noted that while the documents have not been previously made public, they all were seen years ago by the J.F.K. Assassination Records Review Board and were unlikely to significantly affect the official story. He cautioned against conspiratorial thinking that runs against the evidence, which he finds persuasive, that Oswald alone killed Kennedy.

“I can understand why people are curious,” Mr. Holland said. “But the level of distrust in this country is such that people will believe anything. The problem is really with us.”

Indeed, the Kennedy assassination has continued to intrigue and puzzle the American public long after most of the main players have died. While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, most people have never accepted the official version of events. A poll by Gallup in 2013, at the time of the 50th anniversary, found that 61 percent of Americans still believed that others besides Oswald were involved — and that was the lowest percentage of skeptics found in nearly a half century.

Being enveloped by French territory gave Llivia certain tactical advantages as it faced many of the same hurdles as other parts of Catalonia to carry out a vote declared illegal by the Spanish government.

On referendum day, when a mysterious internet shutdown hit the Spanish enclave, Llivia’s mayor decided to use the French internet connection so the vote could proceed, said Laurent Leygue, the mayor of the neighboring French town Estavar.

“As a precautionary measure, they even took the ballots from Llivia to France to count the votes,” said Mr. Leygue, who joined the cheerful crowd on referendum day.

Given their unusual position, Llivia’s residents have long maintained a strong sense of independence.

“This can partly be explained by the peculiar history of the town,” said Marc Delcor, 35, the director of the municipal museum, which is home to the remains of the medieval Esteve Pharmacy, one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe.

Supporters of the separatist movement in Livia even broke a Guinness World Record by lighting about 82,000 candles in the form of the Estelada, the pro-independence flag, just before the referendum was held.

“It was a beautiful, very unique moment,” Ms. Cortizo said. “The whole village was there to sing ‘Els Segadors,’ the official national anthem of Catalonia.”

In the tumultuous aftermath of the vote, Ms. Cortizo was among the around 200,000 people who demonstrated in Barcelona in support of the two secessionist leaders jailed following an order by a Spanish court.

“We brought the 82,000 candles” to the demonstration, Ms. Cortizo said. “We won’t stop protesting until they are released and until we are independent.”

After the referendum, the struggle over Catalonia intensified in an often confusing exchange between the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. After weeks of equivocating, Mr. Puigdemont told the Spanish authorities that Catalan lawmakers might vote for independence. That was not good enough for Mr. Rajoy, who announced on Saturday that he would remove Catalonia’s leadership.

Llivia is also a neighbor to Catalan-speaking areas in France and Andorra. Brice Lafontaine, a spokesman for Unitat Catalana, a party representing the Catalan minority in France, said the party had met with Mr. Puigdemont in August. “I told the president that should it come it, we stand ready to provide the Catalan leaders with all kinds of logistical support, including hospitality,” he said.

The party campaigns for greater autonomy from Paris, though as Mr. Lafontaine pointed out, “French Catalans are not seeking independence, just the recognition of our culture.”

Inside a small pastry shop on Avenida Catalunya, the main artery running through Llivia, some wondered why Mr. Puigdemont did not declare independence, especially after claiming that the referendum had overwhelmingly passed.

“He didn’t say anything really,” said Olivia Morlot, a French national who has lived in Llivia since 2001. “He just threw the ball into Spain’s court.”

Others, like Ester Gonzales, who was born and raised in Llivia, saw the Catalan leader’s approach as “a necessary step toward independence.”

“We need to be patient,” she said. “We understand that independence won’t just happen overnight.”

In Hostal Rusó, a small hotel in the historic center, locals gathered to watch Mr. Puigdemont speak before the regional Parliament on Oct. 10.

“Of course we would have preferred if independence had officially been declared,” Xavier Martinez, 51, said afterward. “But still, President Puigdemont spoke wisely.”

“If independence had indeed been declared,” Mr. Martinez added, “we would find ourselves facing a political dead end.”

That may yet be the case.

“Now the Spanish are going to undermine our claim for independence,” Ms. Cortizo sighed while watching the events unfold on television.

“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Photo

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

Photo

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, Epic’s former publicity director and now heads an agency whose clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”",Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/style/sade-sade-sade.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work. Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions. While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself. We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about. But do they also think better?

Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure. For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.

During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday. Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.

Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour. The exercise was gentle — a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling — and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks. They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.

The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.

He also paid to use some venues, and paid people like food-truck owners who took meals into isolated neighborhoods that had received little or no other support.

The money came from donations to World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit association of chefs that Mr. Andrés established in 2011 after he traveled to Haiti to help that country recover from an earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people.

Popular chefs like Mario Batali, Eric Ripert and Guy Fieri and celebrities including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Bourdain began sending money early. Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs’s widow, gave $1 million after she visited. Several business provided support, including Goya Foods, whose helicopter ferried supplies to remote areas.

Last Saturday, World Central Kitchen signed a $10 million contract with FEMA to produce 120,000 meals a day for two weeks. Other pieces of Mr. Andrés’s operation will likely feed people through Thanksgiving. And other organizations will continue to distribute millions of shelf-stable “meals ready to eat” and boxes of canned food, dried meat, beans and rice.

The Red Cross said Tuesday that since the storm struck, it had distributed 1.4 million pounds of pantry items and 540,000 meals and snacks to 40 communities. Every day up until Wednesday, it was handing out 400 of Mr. Andrés’s sandwiches and as much fruit.

“The Red Cross is working very closely with the entire response community, including government agencies, other nonprofit groups, faith-based organizations, area businesses and others,” said Elizabeth Penniman, vice president for communications. “We are pleased that Chef Andrés is playing such an important role there as well.”

FEMA said that at least eight other organizations are providing emergency food aid in Puerto Rico, including World Vision International, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Puerto Rico State Guard and the Church of Scientology.

With help from the Detroit Historical Society and the Knight Foundation, the theater’s roving production of “Detroit ’67” has traveled to museums, high schools and community centers in the metropolitan region.

“Detroit ’67” is one of three plays inspired by the city; “Paradise Blue,” the second, about an arts-rich African-American neighborhood demolished at midcentury for freeway construction, will be produced at the Signature Theater Company in Manhattan in the spring.

“Skeleton Crew,” the final work in the trilogy, centers on the closing of an automobile plant and its impact on four workers during the 2008 recession. It runs through Oct. 29 at the Detroit Public Theater’s 150-seat space inside the Fisher Music Center; the Detroit Free Press described it as “maybe the best play you’ll see this year.”

The theater was founded in 2015 by Courtney Burkett, a native of the city who had worked in theater here and in New York; Sarah Clare Corporandy, who also serves as managing director at Chautauqua Theater Company in upstate New York, but returned here for this challenge; and Sarah Winkler, a native New Yorker with more than two decades as an actress and producer Off Broadway, who moved here when her husband took a job in Michigan. All three share the title producing artistic director.

“We felt like there was not an anchor for theater serving the city,’’ Ms. Burkett explained, noting the presence of major cultural institutions like the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and Detroit Institute of Arts.

A theater like this “could not have existed 10 years ago,” she added. “Now that the city’s stabilizing and even thriving in so many ways, our artists are also thriving and getting the attention they always deserved.”

Among the challenges is ensuring that, as white women, they remain connected to a city that is more than 80 percent black. (Matrix Theater Company and the African-American focused Plowshares Theater Company both have long histories here.)

In an email, Ms. Corporandy said: “Producing theater in a city that is predominantly African-American means we need to make sure that our stories speak to everyone, to the public we want to serve.”

“We are also very aware of the privilege we come to the table with,” she added, “and we want to be sure that we are leveraging that privilege to give back to this city that we all love, not take from it.”

The Detroit Public Theater annual budget is a relatively modest $1 million; its costs include renting space inside the symphony’s hall. The leaders hope to raise enough money to have a permanent home eventually; in the meantime, they believe that showing work like Ms. Morisseau’s is vital to the theater’s becoming better known to Detroiters, suburbanites, and visitors intrigued by the city’s much-touted comeback.

This playwright was a natural choice for the inaugural 2015-16 season, according to Ms. Burkett. (It presented “Detroit ’67” in a coproduction with Baltimore Center Stage.) And the leaders intend to bring other Michigan artists into the fold, including the playwright Noah Haidle, whose “Birthday Candles” will have its world premiere as the final show this season.

Debbie Erb, the chairwoman of the theater’s board, said leaders want to keep the shows “really accessible.” Ticket prices top out at $45, with group and student discounts and pay as you go options during previews.

Another goal is to “keep actors who are from the Detroit area in Detroit,” Ms. Erb said. “Because why should they have to go to Chicago or New York to earn a decent living?”

Ms. Morisseau admits that until recently she was better known outside her hometown than inside. “Even starting from Detroit,” she said, “local theaters didn’t know who I was until really, really huge things happened for me.”

Clearly that is changing. Ella Joyce, a Detroit native now living in Los Angeles, plays Faye, the lead character in “Skeleton Crew.” She was excited to return for the role. “I don’t think Dominique is just Detroit’s greatest playwright,’’ she said on opening night. “I think she is one of America’s greatest playwrights.”

Ms. Joyce said friends from grade school turned up at performances of the play and came up to speak with her afterward, even bringing childhood photos to remind her who they were.

Writing about the people of Detroit, particularly African-Americans, is crucial to Ms. Morisseau’s work. And while she now lives in Los Angeles, serving on the writing staff of Showtime’s “Shameless,” she believes her work brings Detroiters alive, especially when it is performed by local actors.

“Something kind of magic and organic comes out of the mouth of a native Detroiter when they’re saying my words,’’ she said. “It’s like we speak the same language.”

Earlier this month Ms. Morisseau came to see “Skeleton Crew” with her husband and an entourage of dozens, including her mother, who still lives in Detroit.

“When you are sitting around with half your family that inspired your work, it’s profound and exciting, but it is also overwhelming because these are the people that know it best and that live it,” she said.

It’s for this reason that Ms. Morisseau is not only glad to see her work produced inside the theater, but brought to the public as well.

“Asking communities from all over to not just go to midtown or downtown Detroit to see shows, but come out to the neighborhood where what happened in these neighborhoods happened to someone you know,’’ she said.

“That to me has power, in the best way, to affirm, to vindicate, to humanize and to heal.”",Putting Detroit’s Finest in Detroit Public Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/theater/putting-detroits-finest-in-detroit-public-theater.html

He was stationed in Jacksonville, Fla., when, on a training flight, the plane he was in clipped wings with another plane. The other plane landed safely, but he and his instructor had to bail out.

“It wasn’t uncomfortable except that I went through the top of a Florida pine tree,” he said.

Mr. Weitz, known by the nickname P. J., served as a pilot in the Navy in Vietnam before being selected by NASA for the astronaut corps in 1966.

He was the pilot on the 1973 mission to the Skylab space station, working under Commander Charles Conrad Jr., with Joseph P. Kerwin rounding out the crew. Skylab, the first American space station, had been sent up on May 14, and the three men were to blast off the next day and board it. But a heat shield designed to protect the lab from the sun was damaged during launch, so the crew waited while NASA engineers devised a makeshift repair for them to implement.

Ellen Ochoa, director of the Johnson Space Center, said in a statement, “P. J.’s role on the first Skylab mission helped save NASA’s first space station.”

Two other manned missions visited the station later that year, conducting experiments involving solar observation, the effects of microgravity on humans, and much more. After the last astronauts left in February 1974, Skylab continued to orbit until 1979, when it took a much-publicized but ultimately harmless dive back to Earth, disintegrating as it re-entered the atmosphere.

Mr. Weitz’s wife, the former Suzanne Berry, whom he had married in 1956, was not surprised at the fix-it abilities he demonstrated on the Skylab mission.

“He’s very handy around the house,” she told The New York Times in an interview in June 1973. Shortly before he blasted off for the space station, she said, he was on the roof replacing shingles.

Mr. Weitz returned to the military after that flight and retired in 1976. But he returned to NASA as the space shuttle era began.

On April 4, 1983, Mr. Weitz led a crew of four that took Challenger on its maiden voyage, landing it successfully at Edwards Air Force Base in California on April 9. After the ship exploded almost three years later, the shuttle program was suspended while NASA investigated the cause and did a lot of soul searching about its processes and structure.

Mr. Weitz was among several idle astronauts given management responsibilities; he became a deputy director of the Johnson Space Center, retiring from that post in 1994.

One concern after the Challenger explosion was that NASA had been undertaking too many flights too quickly. Mr. Weitz acknowledged that problem in an interview on the CBS News program “Face the Nation” in 1986.

“In the past I firmly believe that the system has come to succumb, probably subconsciously, to the pressures of schedule,” he said. “And I think one of the things we ought to see that we don’t do again in the future is set ourselves up where we are susceptible to such pressures.”

Suzanne Weitz died last year. Mr. Weitz’s survivors include a daughter, Cindy Difranco; a son, Matt; and a sister, Evelyn Richards.

During his two missions, Mr. Weitz spent 33 days in space, always with a touch of awe. In a 1983 interview with The Times, he recalled that during his Skylab stay, he never tired of looking at the view of Earth.

“Nearly all my time was spent at the window,” he said.","Paul Weitz, Astronaut on Skylab and Challenger, Dies at 85",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/paul-j-weitz-dead-commander-of-shuttle-challenger.html

One barber in the bazaar remembers when one of Mr. Khalili’s commanders came for a haircut. He had long disheveled hair, and hanging from each side were several grenades.

Another time, the barber said, another of Mr. Khalili’s fighters walked into the shop in a hurry. In his hand he had a tiny plastic bag containing four head lice. He handed the bag of lice to the barber and, with a smirk on his face, said: “I am going to the front lines, and you take care of these. If they get skinny or fat by the time I come back, you know what will happen.”

His lifetime voting record has averaged high marks from libertarian and conservative groups, including 95 percent from FreedomWorks, 93 percent from the American Conservative Union, 97 percent from Americans for Prosperity and 73 percent from Heritage Action.

In his 2012 Senate campaign, Mr. Flake’s endorsements included former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the National Rifle Association and FreedomWorks.

Mr. Flake’s support for immigration, which in his Tuesday retirement speech he characterized as a traditional conservative position, has roiled some of his fellow Republicans over the years.

Breitbart News characterized him as a supporter of “amnesty.” The conservative commentator Ann Coulter listed him among “our stupidest Republicans” and proposed that someone challenge him in the primary race.

Estimated number of warheads in the nuclear stockpile

Estimated number of warheads in the nuclear stockpile

The United States nuclear arsenal consists of 4,000 warheads, plus more than 2,000 warheads awaiting dismantlement. This number came into focus recently after a report that President Trump said in July that he wanted a huge increase in the country’s nuclear capability.

So, are 4,000 nuclear warheads enough?

In fact, that is far more than the country could ever need. The nuclear stockpile is so large, and its payload so enormous, researchers determined that the United States could kill large parts of the populations of more than a dozen countries using less than half its arsenal.

While the United States has reduced its nuclear stockpile from the peak of 31,255 warheads in 1967, there are still far too many. Even more troubling, Mr. Trump can unilaterally order a nuclear strike at any time. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, has called the president’s threats toward other countries reckless, saying they could set the nation “on the path to World War III.”

Every effort must be made to avoid the use of nuclear weapons. Reducing the nuclear stockpile is one important step. But legislators can go even further by requiring the president to seek a declaration of war from Congress before launching a first nuclear strike, as Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Ted Lieu of California, both Democrats, have proposed.

Below, the U.S. nuclear arsenal – and the devastation it could inflict under the president’s sole discretion

America’s nuclear stockpile expanded under the grim rationale of “mutually assured destruction,” the Cold War-era strategy aimed at deterring countries from using nuclear weapons because they would be annihilated in a counterattack.

Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara defined the strategy as the ability to kill one-quarter of a country’s population in a nuclear attack. The Natural Resources Defense Council used this measure to calculate the nuclear yield required to “decimate” several countries, providing a sense of the payload unleashed in such an attack.

Guaranteeing “mutually assured destruction” would require launching dozens, if not hundreds, of warheads on a target’s densest population centers. The N.R.D.C. calculated such an attack on China would kill 320 million people by targeting 368 population centers around the country – a scenario of such vast carnage, it can scarcely be imagined. Of course, just a single nuclear warhead dropped nearly anywhere on the planet would have devastating consequences.

The group also measured the effects of a similar attack on the United States. In such a scenario, major American population centers, including New York and Los Angeles, would be targeted. The N.R.D.C. estimated it would take 124 warheads, each with a yield of 475 kilotons, to kill one-quarter of the United States population.

Declining Stockpiles

The United States and Russia have always been the biggest nuclear powers by far. They have dismantled tens of thousands of warheads since 1986, when their combined inventory peaked around 70,000. Even so, the combined total still stands around 8,300 warheads and more than 5,000 awaiting dismantlement. The other countries with nuclear weapons – France, China, Britain, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea – altogether have a small fraction of that amount, about 1,100.

In 2013, President Barack Obama proposed that the United States and Russia reduce their deployed nuclear warheads – ones that are available for immediate use – to 1,000 each, one-third fewer than the current target of 1,550 deployed warheads set under their 2010 nuclear arms control treaty. But Moscow balked at negotiations. Other experts have argued that the United States could do with still fewer.

But few will visit Connecticut, where practicing witchcraft became a crime punishable by death in 1642, decades before it was outlawed in Salem.

The Connecticut Colony sent colonial America’s first condemned witch — Alse Young, a resident of Windsor — to the gallows in 1647. A total of 11 people, nine women and two men, were executed by 1662. The men were the husbands of the convicted women. In total, 35 residents were accused of witchcraft. Fearing for their lives, many left their communities.

By 1750, witchcraft was no longer on the books as a crime.

“Not much comfort to those hanged,” said Anthony Griego, a retired New Haven police officer who lives in Hamden, Conn., and is a member of a group called CT Witch Memorial. The middle word of the organization’s name is an acronym for Witch Interrogations, Trials & Colonial Hangings.

Mr. Griego said he learned of Connecticut’s witch trials 20 years ago and was surprised that no one had sought to clear the names of the victims, who he said were treated unfairly “by a judicial system made of men who felt divinely inspired.”",Where Was the First Woman Condemned for Witchcraft?

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

The legislative skirmish could also imperil the agenda of Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor, who has a significant lead in the polls.

Should Mr. Sweeney lose, Mr. Murphy’s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15, provide more funding for Planned Parenthood and legalize marijuana would face a much more difficult legislative path, not just because the Democratic advantage in the Senate would shrink, but because Mr. Sweeney is an adroit power broker.

Mr. Murphy, who has the support of Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union, has chosen not to take sides, a stance which some Democratic leaders have privately complained about and could lead to a strained relationship if Mr. Murphy is elected governor.

“This is one where folks don’t always, where three parties, don’t always come out to the same conclusion,” Mr. Murphy said, referring to himself, Mr. Sweeney and the union. “I’m on the line with him, on the ballot with him, and trying to get him elected, and, to his credit, he’s trying to get me elected.”

Mr. Murphy would not say if he would ask the teachers’ union to stop campaigning against Mr. Sweeney.

“The one thing I’ve done explicitly is to be there beside him, and that’s the reason I was texting him today,” Mr. Murphy said about Mr. Sweeney. “Because I said, ‘Listen I want to come down and campaign with him, go door to door, be visible and be seen with him.’”

Mr. Sweeney said he believed that Mr. Murphy had sought to quietly reach out to the union.

“He told me he tried,” Mr. Sweeney said. “So I’m going to take him as his word, even though there have been publications and people saying that he didn’t. Because he said he did. And I want to work with Phil next year.”

Other Democrats have jumped into the fray. Last month, 16 Democratic state senators signed a letter to Marie Blistan, the president of the union, condemning its strategy.

“It’s inconceivable to us that the N.J.E.A. is supporting Republican extremist Fran Grenier, an avowed ally of Chris Christie and Donald Trump, both of whom have demonized teachers and unions throughout their political careers,” the letter said.

The teachers’ union claims that its effort to unseat Mr. Sweeney is driven by its members.

“Our members made it extremely clear that they want to see a change of leadership,” said Steve Baker, the union’s director of communications. “Clearly, Steve Sweeney is very, very well financed. He has the support of a lot of people who have been able to put a lot of money into his campaign, and in order to run a strong campaign, we’ve had to also step up and be willing to invest in that endorsement that our members made.”

Mr. Grenier did not respond to emails requesting comment.

As the race enters its final days, the teachers’ union has continued its advertising blitz. Since Sept. 27, Garden State Forward, the super PAC run by the union, has spent nearly $3 million on television advertisements, including $600,000 to broadcast one attack ad during a single week, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks ad spending.

To put the roughly $3 million worth of television commercials in context, that is more than Murphy’s campaign has spent on broadcast ads throughout the state during the general election, according to Advertising Analytics.

Mr. Sweeney said the union has also distributed pamphlets critical of him to legislators and candidates in other districts, a move that he interpreted as the union issuing a warning about what happens when an elected official crosses the labor group.

“This is sending a message to the other legislators,” Mr. Sweeney said.

The bad blood between Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union stems from disagreements over pensions. In 2011, Mr. Sweeney pushed a bill that became law limiting state contributions to pension and health benefits. Last year, Mr. Sweeney promised to support a constitutional amendment that would require the state to make full pension payments every quarter.

For the teachers, this was unforgivable.

Despite the onslaught, Mr. Sweeney said he was confident that he would prevail. As for the future of his relationship with the teachers’ union, Mr. Sweeney was uncertain.

“The bigger question is how do they figure on going forward with me,” he said. “I’m not a grudge guy by any means. But they’ve made this pretty personal.”",N.J.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

Much of the income inequality in the county, which is still acutely felt, is due to the aftereffects of the systematic racism of apartheid, which ended in 1994. Decades of work to abolish that system culminated in the swearing-in of Nelson Mandela as the nation’s first black head of state.

If you’re looking to experience the essentials of that history, a visit to Soweto is a must. Just a 25-minute drive from downtown, Soweto (which stands for South Western Township) was a major center of apartheid resistance in the ’70s and ’80s. I went along on a half-day Soweto tour booked through the Curiocity Backpackers hostel (350 rand) with about a dozen other people and found the experience more than worth the effort.

Our guide, Semphiwe, was sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, giving us all names in Zulu or Xhosa and ribbing us if we couldn’t pronounce them properly. He was from Soweto, and extremely proud of it, noting that it has over a million residents. And it was the only place, he said, where you could, at one point, find two Nobel Peace Prize winners (Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu) living on one street. “And they say it’s not safe!” he said, feigning exasperation.

We first stopped by Kliptown, one of Soweto’s poorest areas, and the Little Rose Center, a school and youth center. The overwhelming poverty of the shanties and tin-roof shacks of Kliptown was sobering — we spent roughly 30 minutes winding through the mazelike, dirt roads, distinguished only by the odd spray-painted wooden board or the rusted-out iron coils of a mattress.

We also saw the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in the Orlando West neighborhood (admission, 30 rand), which documents the killing of 12-year-old Pieterson by police, a key moment during the 1976 Soweto Uprising; and we saw the Apartheid Museum (85 rand), about 10 miles east of Orlando West, which captures the nuances and the horrors of that system. A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to Mandela, including old letters and personal effects as well as a replica of his tiny cell on Robben Island.

Another benefit of riding the Shosholoza Meyl was having a sharpened sense of movement and travel. Harry Emanuel, a fellow passenger, noted that border crossings are more meaningful when done by land. “On a plane you just stamp your passport,” he said. “Physically crossing you actually get a sense that, oh, this is a big deal.”

Meals, generally an attempt at something upscale, were good overall. A dinner might start with soup followed by a hake filet, leg of lamb, then tiramisù, and finally a plate of cheese and biscuits. It was not quite gourmet, but on par with, say, first-class airline food. Service was friendly and helpful.

Trains force your brain to slow down. With no internet access and the knowledge you’ll be on a train for an entire day, you have to mine your creative resources. I played a game of Scrabble — in Afrikaans, no less — with a friendly woman named Lueen and her two friends. My traveling companion and I sat for hours after dinner quizzing each other on world capitals. I finished an actual book for the first time in longer than I care to admit. It was wonderful and sad — wonderful to recapture this organic way of having fun, and sad to realize I’d likely soon be back to my old ways.

I also spent a decent amount of time just looking out the window, as the scenery gradually morphed from flat grassland to sharp mountain peaks. I usually travel by plane, an environment where people are usually slightly harried and irritated. Here, it was the opposite: We chatted, drank coffee, relaxed and counted ourselves lucky to take part in such a special journey.

I caught Mr. Stander, the train’s employee, gazing out the window several times. A 40-year veteran of the industry, from a small township four hours east of Cape Town, he seemed to be showing no signs of tiring of his job. “Like I say,” he said, “Here you do not need a TV.”",A Meditative Train Ride Through South Africa,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/travel/south-africa-train-johannesburg-soweto.html

It seemed like there was more to this narrative. I decided to learn as many as possible of the stories of the girls who had been sent on suicide missions and then found a way out. I interviewed 18 of them for today’s story, with photos of the girls by Adam Ferguson.

My amazing fixer and I consulted aid workers and security forces, who helped us locate the girls during two separate reporting trips to Maiduguri. Finding a safe place to interview and photograph them would be a challenge regardless of the topic. Maiduguri is a bustling city — full of teahouses, meat stalls and busy people going about their day — that feels a lot safer than it probably is. And foreign journalists draw a lot of attention.

We were at risk, but we were especially worried about the girls. If Boko Haram found out these girls had failed to detonate their bombs, they could possibly be killed. And if regular people discovered they had spent time with Boko Haram, even as hostages, they could be stigmatized as sympathizers. We settled on a quiet park, a hotel room, an empty restaurant.

Adam’s job was particularly difficult. Imagine being tasked with taking portraits of girls whose faces, we felt, should not be shown?

The girls did not request anonymity, but based on the advice of our local fixer, we obscured their faces and did not use their full names. The girls seemed relieved to have the chance to tell their stories.

I knew from my experience reporting on the insurgency that these girls had been through a string of horrible circumstances, beginning with their capture. Some had family members killed before their eyes. Fighters stuck one girl in a room with corpses, and when militants asked about her strength, she presumed they wanted her to clear the bodies. But they wanted her to carry a bomb.

Far from willing participants, each girl said that the armed militants had forcibly tied the bombs to them — many times after they had refused to have sex with their captors.

I tried to get the girls to explain their suicide missions. “What happened when Boko Haram told you to carry a bomb?” I asked. Their stories flowed.

Every one of the 18 had a narrative worthy of a dissertation on the horrors of war. Some of the girls cried as they recalled their terror. Some told their stories in squeaky voices that revealed their young age. Others were fierce, proud of how they had saved lives by not carrying out their missions.

As a reporter, my job isn’t to take sides. But I couldn’t stop myself from believing these girls were heroes. Think of the lives saved by not detonating a hidden bomb at a crowded marketplace or manned checkpoint as they had been ordered to do.

I asked the Nigerian military whether bomber girls who surrender themselves are rewarded. Why not give them cash? Why not offer scholarships?

A military spokesman said girls who surrender their bombs are celebrated. But that wasn’t the case for any of the girls with whom I talked. After they surrendered, each had been detained, some for months, while officials tried to determine whether they were loyal to Boko Haram. I asked each girl at the end of her interview what she wanted to be when she grew up. They were still mostly children, after all, and I thought that ending with a question that focused them on the future might leave them with a sense of hope. One of the girls told me she was desperate to go back to school; the war had interrupted her education. Eventually, she wants to become a lawyer. “I want to fight for people’s rights,” she said.","18 Escaped Girls, 18 Interviews",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/insider/boko-haram-suicide-bombers.html

Not likely, but that’s not my point. It’s easy enough to poke a sharp stick in the chief justice’s late-acquired worry about the Supreme Court sullying its hands in politically fraught cases. What about Citizens United, one might ask, or Shelby County v. Holder, with the chief justice’s majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 dismantled the recently reenacted Voting Rights Act? That’s not my point either. “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late,” Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote. He might have said the same for the judicial modesty the chief justice seemed to be advocating when it comes to addressing gerrymanders.

I’d like to take seriously the chief justice’s evident worry about the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and play it out a bit. The concern is not a new one for John Roberts. It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the public’s view.

“It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,” he said then, adding: “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.”

So I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: “The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.”

And assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal. The gap isn’t huge — 30 percent “too conservative” to 23 percent “too liberal” — but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant. In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, “too liberal” outstripped “too conservative” with a gap of 17 percent. Gallup’s analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third. In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.

The chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the court’s modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them. There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the court’s liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure. That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.

I assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument. And I’d like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart. Whatever happens with this case — a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately — there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.

In the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the court’s hands on these issues. Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases. It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina. In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings. These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.

The Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court. When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Court’s door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the court’s interests are best served by sitting it out?",Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Court’s Legitimacy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/politics-supreme-court-legitimacy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Unfortunately, Jeff Flake is only the latest example of a Republican whose willingness to speak out against his party’s current standard-bearer has cost him politically.

The president has spent weeks impugning Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for pointing out that Mr. Trump is “debasing” the nation. Mr. Trump, as a candidate and as president, has also repeatedly and viciously attacked Senator John McCain, a war hero who has sacrificed more for the United States than most of us can even imagine.

Republican leaders have offered occasional defenses of their colleagues from these attacks: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called Mr. Flake “a very fine man” of “high principles” on Tuesday. But they have largely remained on the sidelines as Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked those few Republicans who have dared to call for civility and compromise.

The consequences of this could be grave.

If the Republican Party under Donald Trump has no room for independent-minded conservatives, and if, in the coming years, senators like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are replaced by fringe conservatives handpicked because of their blind loyalty to this president, it will be too late for responsible conservatives to salvage the party they’ve built over generations.

As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m particularly worried by the prospect of Mr. Trump’s narrow, nationalist “America First” foreign policy replacing the vision of lawmakers like Mr. McCain, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake who have pushed for strong American global leadership based on human rights, the rule of law and strong international agreements. I sincerely hope that Republican leaders recognize this before it’s too late.

As for Democrats, there should be no sense of satisfaction in what is happening to the Republican Party. The balance of two functioning political parties has been essential to our country’s success. In fact, we should take this moment to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: How much do our own party’s internal battles resemble the fight happening within the Republican Party? As Democrats call for independence and pragmatism from Republicans, we should be asking ourselves how tolerant we are of dissent within our own party and how much we are really willing to reach across the aisle.

Senator Flake finished his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday by quoting Abraham Lincoln, who reminded Americans on the eve of the Civil War that “we are not enemies, but friends” and “though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” Mr. Flake wisely warned Republicans and Democrats that our bonds are dangerously strained. Now is the time to ensure they don’t break.

Perhaps my husband, a biographer who has spent much of his professional life searching for documents, had not been able to stand seeing the journals sitting out with the trash? Or I had misremembered, wishing I’d thrown them out but not quite able to?

In any event, there they were and we were awash in memorabilia. It was a life phase that no one had told us about: one in which a massive wave of objects, each representing a distinct shard of time, broke over us.

It arrived carrying with it the weird, disquieting distortions that all too often accompany memory. Our brains focus easily on the present and on the deep past, but the stuff between is elastic, dilating and contracting unpredictably. Whole swaths of time simply don’t compute for us. Whenever I’m faced with a standard online form requiring my birthday, I stare in bafflement as I scroll down the long column of years.

The reappearance of my diaries was disorienting. They didn’t feel like a quaint remnant of the past. They felt deeply, unpleasantly familiar: the baby-blue, fake-leather cover with “My Diary” stamped in gold letters with its little lock and key. My self-conscious 12-year-old entries seemed as if I’d written them yesterday: “I see myself with complete clarity reading this page … thinking how long ago that was when I was merely a schoolgirl not even in high school. I’m already that person of the future.”

Oh yeah? Well, here I am and I remember all too well being that annoying person writing in the diary.

So why save these remnants? In the past, relatives faded graciously into oblivion. Becoming dead and then even deader, as they were no longer known by anyone living. Their descendants easily maintained the illusion that their ancestors had never been real, breathing people like themselves. The ancient couples were quaint in the stiff, sepia photos posing in their Sunday best or in jerky 16-millimeter home movies. Or there were no images at all and they simply got out of the way when their time was over. They ghosted themselves.

To make matters even more complicated, our recent relatives, armed with endless videos, create their own highly edited narratives — virtual motion pictures — preserving what seems to them most engaging, flattering or fun. You won’t find their pictures of them eating lunch at their desk, sleeping contorted in the confines of an overnight flight, waiting on a subway platform or watching TV reruns. It’s all been a great holiday!

Will new generations need storerooms for this ever-increasing load of familial documentation? Actually, we may be the last one to have our experiences annealed to physical objects. In the future, descendants as well as historians will be able to experience their subjects’ lives virtually in real time through emails, texts, Facebook entries, Instagrams, videos. It’s exhausting to contemplate. TMI.

Yet for now, these lingering objects haunt us. Undoubtedly my patient was right. When we discard a person’s accumulated possessions, we are throwing out the record of a life. The soft thump of the garbage bags on the landing tells of a small, soft death. Is it necessary? Yes. But it’s an erasure that’s irrevocable.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

Being enveloped by French territory gave Llivia certain tactical advantages as it faced many of the same hurdles as other parts of Catalonia to carry out a vote declared illegal by the Spanish government.

On referendum day, when a mysterious internet shutdown hit the Spanish enclave, Llivia’s mayor decided to use the French internet connection so the vote could proceed, said Laurent Leygue, the mayor of the neighboring French town Estavar.

“As a precautionary measure, they even took the ballots from Llivia to France to count the votes,” said Mr. Leygue, who joined the cheerful crowd on referendum day.

Given their unusual position, Llivia’s residents have long maintained a strong sense of independence.

“This can partly be explained by the peculiar history of the town,” said Marc Delcor, 35, the director of the municipal museum, which is home to the remains of the medieval Esteve Pharmacy, one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe.

Supporters of the separatist movement in Livia even broke a Guinness World Record by lighting about 82,000 candles in the form of the Estelada, the pro-independence flag, just before the referendum was held.

“It was a beautiful, very unique moment,” Ms. Cortizo said. “The whole village was there to sing ‘Els Segadors,’ the official national anthem of Catalonia.”

In the tumultuous aftermath of the vote, Ms. Cortizo was among the around 200,000 people who demonstrated in Barcelona in support of the two secessionist leaders jailed following an order by a Spanish court.

“We brought the 82,000 candles” to the demonstration, Ms. Cortizo said. “We won’t stop protesting until they are released and until we are independent.”

After the referendum, the struggle over Catalonia intensified in an often confusing exchange between the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. After weeks of equivocating, Mr. Puigdemont told the Spanish authorities that Catalan lawmakers might vote for independence. That was not good enough for Mr. Rajoy, who announced on Saturday that he would remove Catalonia’s leadership.

Llivia is also a neighbor to Catalan-speaking areas in France and Andorra. Brice Lafontaine, a spokesman for Unitat Catalana, a party representing the Catalan minority in France, said the party had met with Mr. Puigdemont in August. “I told the president that should it come it, we stand ready to provide the Catalan leaders with all kinds of logistical support, including hospitality,” he said.

The party campaigns for greater autonomy from Paris, though as Mr. Lafontaine pointed out, “French Catalans are not seeking independence, just the recognition of our culture.”

Inside a small pastry shop on Avenida Catalunya, the main artery running through Llivia, some wondered why Mr. Puigdemont did not declare independence, especially after claiming that the referendum had overwhelmingly passed.

“He didn’t say anything really,” said Olivia Morlot, a French national who has lived in Llivia since 2001. “He just threw the ball into Spain’s court.”

Others, like Ester Gonzales, who was born and raised in Llivia, saw the Catalan leader’s approach as “a necessary step toward independence.”

“We need to be patient,” she said. “We understand that independence won’t just happen overnight.”

In Hostal Rusó, a small hotel in the historic center, locals gathered to watch Mr. Puigdemont speak before the regional Parliament on Oct. 10.

“Of course we would have preferred if independence had officially been declared,” Xavier Martinez, 51, said afterward. “But still, President Puigdemont spoke wisely.”

“If independence had indeed been declared,” Mr. Martinez added, “we would find ourselves facing a political dead end.”

That may yet be the case.

“Now the Spanish are going to undermine our claim for independence,” Ms. Cortizo sighed while watching the events unfold on television.

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Twitter will ban Russia Today and Sputnik, the two Kremlin-backed international news outlets, from advertising on its platform, a company official said on Thursday.

The decision marks one of the most aggressive moves by an American social media company against the Russian outlets, which United States intelligence officials have linked to a wide-ranging Kremlin effort, both covert and overt, to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

Twitter’s ban comes as United States authorities are pressuring Russia Today to register as a foreign agent under a World War II-era law intended to stop Nazi propaganda.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said in a blog post announcing the ban.

The ban will not apply to any other advertisers, Twitter said. Russia Today and Sputnik will be allowed to retain their Twitter accounts.

Twitter said it had earned $1.9 million in advertising revenue from Russia Today since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.",Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia-today-sputnik.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

These so-called shallow discharges mean you don’t use a full charge cycle every time you top off your phone after carrying it for a few hours or plug in your laptop after working on the couch for the afternoon. In reality, the biggest enemy of modern batteries is temperature. The cooler you can keep your battery, either while charging it or while it’s in use, the more you can prolong its life.

Myth 3: More megapixels mean better cameras

When small, portable point-and-shoot cameras took off and larger, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras became more affordable, there was a brief rush among manufacturers to push out models with greater numbers of “megapixels,” the unit of capacity used to define how much information a digital camera’s sensor can capture. Unfortunately, because those numbers dazzled spec-hungry consumers and could be used to market cameras, shoppers began to assume that more megapixels meant you were buying a better camera. And you can’t really blame them — marketers latched on to the idea, and even now, in modern smartphones, the first spec anyone mentions about the built-in camera is the megapixels.

All of this led to the “megapixel myth,” which has persisted for almost a decade. While most budding photographers understand that more isn’t always better in a camera, shoppers looking for a good smartphone camera, and the phone manufacturers themselves, haven’t seemed to learn the lesson.

Megapixels still count — they do tell you how powerful a camera’s sensor is, which is important for professionals or anyone who needs to print out physical photographs (when translated to paper more pixels per inch can mean more detailed prints), but it doesn’t necessarily tell you how good the photos taken by that camera will be.

To find that out, look past the specs (again!) and to reviews. Even better, look for examples of photos taken with a certain phone or camera and compare them to those from other popular models — or even the one you already have. Look for reviews that mention a camera’s lowlight performance and, perhaps most important, get familiar with your camera’s options. The best photos come from someone who knows how to tweak the settings for the perfect shot.

Myth 4: “Planned obsolescence” is why your phone slows down right before a new model comes out

It happens every year or so: Just before the latest and greatest phone comes out, your phone suddenly starts running slowly. Maybe it starts freezing, or the apps you use get sluggish. Either way, if you can relate, you can probably also understand the common feeling that this is all a plan by tech companies to force you into upgrading — a trick called “planned obsolescence.” While that’s a real problem in some specific cases, assuming it’s the reason everyone’s old phones get slow before new ones are announced is, well, a bit of an oversimplification.

In reality, it’s not a conspiracy, and it’s not some corporate trick to force you into the newest tech, or trap you on the consumerist treadmill. It’s just a side effect of an ever-evolving and ever-improving industry. As those new phones are released, they come with more memory, better screens, faster processors and other specs that, in general, you shouldn’t care about — unless developers start building their apps around them. When they do, they optimize their apps for the newer devices, leaving your older ones in the dust.

So as apps are updated to make use of all of the features on those new devices, they seem to slow down on older phones. And unless the developers care enough to make sure your older phones are properly supported, the problem only gets worse over time. The annoying end result may be the same, but you can at least rest comfortably knowing there’s no massive conspiracy (here, anyway) to make you keep spending money.

Myth 5: Extended warranty plans are worth your money

It’s tough to buy anything at this point without being offered an extended warranty. Whether you’re shopping online or in a brick-and-mortar store, retailers often dangle third-party “protection programs” and “service plans” in front of you, promising that, for a few extra bucks, they’ll replace or repair your purchase if damaged over the next few years. The problem with these offers is that they’re almost always unnecessary — or worse than what you could get otherwise with a little savvy shopping.

In many cases, the pricey extended warranty runs right alongside the existing manufacturer’s warranty, which means you may be paying twice for coverage the phone’s maker already provides. So be sure to research the warranty that comes with your device. Similarly, if you use a credit card, you may even have extended warranty protection through the card’s issuer — check with that company before you add the pricey phone to your cart.

Finally, consider how much the extended warranty costs versus the actual total of the gadget you’re buying. You may be better off taking the money you would have used on the warranty plan and stashing it in a savings account as a “rainy day fund.” Then, if you do need to pay for a repair or replacement, you can use your own cash instead of having to jump through the hoops of getting service from the company managing the protection program.",Five Tech Myths People Still Believe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/smarter-living/five-tech-myths-people-still-believe.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In 2016, California wildlife officials recorded the highest ever number of stranded otters, 474. That’s up from 299 a decade earlier.

Many of the otters are mortally wounded by sharks. Some show evidence of disease, and others of poisoning linked to the algal blooms that have also been killing sea lions and menacing the state’s fishing industry.

The blooms occur naturally, but researchers believe they are being intensified by runoff that pushes waste and fertilizer into the Pacific. They release a toxin called domoic acid that winds its way through the marine life food chain.

Melissa Miller, a Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian who has overseen hundreds of otter necropsies, said more research was needed to fully understand how domoic acid was harming the otter population.

But she added, “I think we can safely say domoic acid is a big deal in otters. The hard part is how big of a deal.”

Otters are regarded as a keystone species, which means they are essential components of their ecosystem.

That they’re struggling should sound alarm bells not only about potential harms to marine life, but to humans as well, wildlife experts say.

“I see them as sort of a proxy for the bigger issue of land-sea pollution,” said Dr. Miller.

And don’t forget, she added, “We eat a lot of the same things that otters eat. And we clearly see that some of the things that otters are getting are associated with the food that they’re eating.”

A benefit concert for Northern California fire victims is to be headlined by the Bay Area bands Dead & Company and Metallica.

The concert, under the banner Band Together Bay Area, was announced Wednesday as communities continued to reckon with the destruction of more than 8,000 homes and other structures.

The financial impact of the wine country fires is not yet fully known. Moody’s, the credit rating agency, estimated insured losses would total at least $4.6 billion.

The concert will be held Nov. 9 at San Francisco’s AT&T Park with tickets from $50 to $200. Also performing will be Dave Matthews and G-Eazy, an Oakland rapper.

“The recent tragic events up in Napa County, Sonoma County and Mendocino have left us all saddened, left us all flabbergasted and trying to figure out how in some way we could bond together and help,” said Lars Ulrich, Metallica’s drummer, in an announcement video.

All proceeds will go to Tipping Point Community, a nonprofit in San Francisco that works with the poor.

Separately, the concert organizers said $6.5 million in relief aid had been raised from a number of Bay Area businesses, including the San Francisco Giants, Google and Salesforce.

Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia). In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people.

“This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything,” said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper. “The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.”

Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage. The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull.

After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.

Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.

Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.

They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.

The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. “Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’” said Dr. Goff.

He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. “Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.”

Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.

But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.

Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.

“Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,” he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. “Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.”

The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.

His remarks echo the concerns of Japanese and other automakers in Britain, like Germany’s BMW, which makes the Mini in the country. They worry that Brexit could add to their costs and complicate the flow of vehicles, components and employees between Britain and the Continent.

Indeed, if the British government does not manage to negotiate barrier-free access to the European market after Brexit, vehicles made in the country “may face an import tariff” of perhaps 10 percent, according to Peter Wells, a professor at the Cardiff Business School. That could hurt the competitiveness of mass-market manufacturers’ Britain-based operations.

Toyota, he said, may be particularly vulnerable because it manufactures both cars and engines in Britain. A high proportion of British content might put the company’s vehicles into a foreign-made category elsewhere in Europe.

So far, carmakers in Britain have been patient, and moved ahead with investments necessary to keep their plants on track.

Toyota, for instance, said in March that it would invest 240 million pounds, or $315 million, to upgrade its plant in Burnaston, England, with the British government kicking in a further £21 million for items like training and research.

Overall investment, though, appears to be sliding downward.

According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a trade group, publicly announced investments in the British car industry fell to £1.7 billion last year, from £2.5 billion in 2015. That trend appears to be accelerating, with the figure totaling £647 million in the first half of this year. The trade group attributes the falling numbers to the carmakers holding back from commitments until they see how Brexit is likely to play out.

“I think the issue is clarity more than anything else,” Mr. Wells said. Without knowing what sort of arrangements will emerge from Brexit, he added, the industry would find it difficult to plan ahead and make long-term investment decisions.

Car manufacturing in Britain employs about 170,000 people, according to the trade group. Largely because of the stakes involved, the government has provided aid to Toyota and other companies, and is backing research into electric, hydrogen-powered and self-driving vehicles.

Still, negotiations between Britain and the European Union have been agonizingly slow so far, with both sides seemingly unable to move into the meat-and-potatoes talks that will address the terms that businesses based in Britain will face after Brexit.

Companies like Toyota, however, are quite clear in describing their needs.

The Uzbek opening helps Afghanistan, too, in enhanced trade; next month, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, will pay the first state visit by an Afghan leader to Uzbekistan since the American invasion in 2001.","The opening is one of the more improbable developments in the politics of the former Soviet states, among which Uzbekistan, the third-most-populous former Soviet country, has long been written off as a black hole of repression and poverty.

It has caught many political observers off guard, not least because of the person championing the program, President Shavkat M. Mirziyoyev. A former Soviet apparatchik, Mr. Mirziyoyev served for 13 years as prime minister to the mercurial and heavy-handed Mr. Karimov, who in his final years had taken to imprisoning even members of his own family.

“This is the moment of hope,” Steve Swerdlow, a researcher with Human Rights Watch and a longtime critic of Uzbekistan’s political system, said in an interview. The rights group plans to publish a cautiously upbeat report on Uzbekistan, the first in years, on Thursday. “The question now is how structural and sustained this will become.”

Some see in the opening only a feint toward liberalism, intended to dupe international observers just long enough to lift trade embargoes imposed on cotton, a major export commodity.

Mr. Swerdlow, for example, has called attention to the arrest last month of a dissident writer, Nurullo Otahonov, after he returned from exile hoping to take advantage of the thaw. “It’s two steps forward, one step back,” Mr. Swerdlow said.

Still, the thaw, if it persists, could redraw the political map at the center of Asia. Uzbekistan is an important supply route for United States military operations in Afghanistan, a potential trading partner with Afghanistan and a steppingstone for overland trade between China and Europe — a role it has played since the days of the fabled Silk Road.

The thaw is all the more surprising because another powerful figure, Rustam R. Inoyatov, the head of the domestic intelligence agency, the S.N.B., the main successor to the K.G.B. in Uzbekistan, remains in place. It was Mr. Inoyatov who reportedly had persuaded the aging Mr. Karimov to prosecute his own daughter, Gulnara Karimova, on extortion and embezzlement charges and to imprison a nephew in a psychiatric clinic. The nephew has since been released; the daughter remains in detention.

Behind-the-scenes tension between Mr. Mirziyoyev and Mr. Inoyatov over the scope of the thaw has now become the main narrative thread of Uzbek politics, analysts say. For now, Mr. Mirziyoyev seems to have the upper hand.

“What is kind of fascinating is we don’t know the extent the current leadership wants to reform, how far they will go,” said Sean R. Roberts, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University and a close observer of Uzbekistan. “One of the characteristics of Uzbek politics is it is extremely opaque.”

Pressing economic woes seem to be part of the motivation. Uzbekistan, with a population of 34 million and a high birthrate, is unable to provide enough jobs for a bulging youth population, Mr. Roberts said.

“Economic concerns drove him to decide they had to delicately dismantle Karimov’s system,” he said of Mr. Mirziyoyev. “It’s possible they want enough reform to open their economy for foreign investment, without opening the political sphere.”

Still, Mr. Roberts said, Uzbekistan’s liberalization represents some of the first positive political news out of Central Asia in years. “It’s been quite some time,” he said.

The authorities are, for example, pointing to a recent acquittal in a criminal case, something virtually unheard-of in Uzbekistan, where judges traditionally rubber stamped decisions made by prosecutors. That is one reason the prisons are overflowing.

In foreign policy, the new government has sought to tamp down seemingly senseless conflicts with its neighbors over water and borders. The Uzbek opening helps Afghanistan, too, in enhanced trade; next month, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, will pay the first state visit by an Afghan leader to Uzbekistan since the American invasion in 2001.

The Uzbek government in September lifted restrictions on exchanging foreign currency, eliminating a black market and opening the way for foreign investment.

After years of criticism for bringing in the cotton harvest with forced labor, including by children, the government demonstrably called back students from the fields midway through this year’s harvest, though young-looking fieldworkers were still seen in some fields on a recent visit.

The government is replacing the cult of personality that swirled around the former president with a new national idea it calls “Enlightened Islam,” focusing on Islamic modernization, referring to the scientific accomplishments in algebra and astronomy achieved in Central Asia in past centuries.

“We are opening to the world,” Aliyor N. Tilavov, a department head in the Uzbek Foreign Ministry, said in an interview about the political and economic program.

Still, a heavy-handed police surveillance system tracking people suspected of Islamist extremism has not been fully dismantled. There are still no independent nongovernmental organizations or political parties.

And the government has released only 16 political prisoners so far out of a population that runs into the thousands, human rights groups estimate, more than all other former Soviet countries combined.

Mr. Bekjanov, a tall, strapping grandfather, bore the brunt of the old system. Human Rights Watch called him the world’s longest-imprisoned-journalist; he was convicted of a number of trumped-up charges, including terrorism, while he was writing for the opposition newspaper Erk, or Freedom.

He is now enjoying his newfound freedom, and he said he did not carry a grudge. “The man I am angry with is dead,” he said.

If the reformers triumph in what he sees as a struggle with the unreformed security apparatus, he said, Uzbekistan could see real change.

But he does not plan to return to journalism. Instead, he is writing a book, which he will call — after the story of his life and the name of one of the prisons where he spent 18 years — “Goodbye to Youth.”","Once Closed and Repressive, Uzbekistan Is Opening Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/asia/uzbekistan-politics.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But after the Yankees were eliminated last weekend, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi.
He largely absolved Girardi for leading the Yankees to just one playoff appearance — a wild-card berth in 2015 — since the previous one, in 2012.
“Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi?
Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadn’t made the playoffs in two to three years?","That Yankees team, with so many players who had not been tested, exceeded most expectations this season and chased the Red Sox to the next to last day of the regular season for the division title. Ultimately, the Yankees settled for a wild-card berth before embarking on an inspiring run to the cusp of the World Series.

Girardi’s unrelenting manner — be it his rigorous preparation, his unwillingness to concede any cause or his sometimes contentious back and forth with the news media — was reflected in this club, which staged numerous comebacks this season and then twice rallied from two-games-to-none deficits in postseason series only to ultimately fall short in the second instance.

But it was during the postseason run that Girardi came under fierce criticism for his managing. In the Yankees’ Game 2 loss in the division series against the Cleveland Indians, he declined to ask for a replay review of a hit-by-pitch call by the plate umpire — a decision that helped open the doors for a decisive Indians comeback.

Girardi, who made a rare admission the next day — “I screwed up,” he said repeatedly at a news conference — was afforded a reprieve when the Yankees rallied to win the next three games against the Indians to advance to the A.L.C.S. against the Houston Astros.

Still, the withering criticism that was directed at him after Game 2 seemed to affect him deeply and, for the first time, raised the notion that he might not necessarily want to return as manager in 2018.

And last Saturday night, after the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros, Girardi had an almost fatalistic tone as he discussed his baseball future.

“I’ve had 10 great years here,” he said. “I feel extremely blessed. God has been good to me, and we’ll see what the future holds.”

Though Cashman and Girardi have divergent personalities and far different interests, they had generally enjoyed a strong working relationship for the last decade. Though they rarely socialized together, they spoke almost daily during the season.

“I think he knows that he can speak his mind in a constructive way with me, and I can speak my mind in a constructive way with him,” Cashman said at the start of the 2016 season. “There’s an openness that is encouraged here. I acquire the talent, and Joe deploys the talent, and sometimes you’ll have disagreements on players’ capabilities that I’ve acquired or strategies that he’s employing.

“You’ve got to be able to work through those in a healthy manner to have a successful manager-general-manager relationship, and I’m proud to say we have that,’’ Cashman added.

But after the Yankees were eliminated last weekend, Cashman was vague in his assessment of Girardi.

“I think everybody did everything they possibly could to get where we wanted to go, to be the last team standing, and we fell short,” he said.

At a time when the ability to relate to players is becoming more valued — the new managers of the Yankees’ two rivals, Mickey Callaway of the Mets and Alex Cora of the Red Sox, are viewed as strong communicators — Girardi may have had some difficulties on that front. He became so frustrated this season over catcher Gary Sanchez’s inattentiveness in blocking pitches that he publicly called him out, a rarity for Girardi in the past.

And in the wake of Girardi’s botched replay decision, closer Aroldis Chapman “liked’’ a social media post that urged the Yankees not to bring Girardi back. Chapman later said he inadvertently “liked” the post.

Girardi, who was chosen over Don Mattingly to replace Joe Torre as manager, had a rocky first season in 2008, when the Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time since the strike-aborted season of 1994. But after a lavish spending spree, the Yankees made an immediate turnaround and won the 2009 World Series — the 27th in franchise history — in a new stadium.

That championship also meant a change of uniform for Girardi. He switched to No. 28 — from No. 27 — because he continued to want a visible reminder of the number of championships the Yankees have accumulated, along with the inference that another one would surely come soon enough.

But with players who were the foundation of their championship years — Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera — aging and retiring, the Yankees were unable to win another under Girardi’s leadership.

In an interview before the start of the season, the Yankees’ principal owner, Hal Steinbrenner, said that the team had not developed enough talent in recent years. He largely absolved Girardi for leading the Yankees to just one playoff appearance — a wild-card berth in 2015 — since the previous one, in 2012.

“What did I look at?” Steinbrenner said. “Was any of what was going on the fault of Joe Girardi? Was Joe Girardi the fact we hadn’t made the playoffs in two to three years? Had he lost control of the team? Did the players no longer respect him? Is it a serious situation in that regard? And the answer to that in my opinion was no.”

Steinbrenner added: “So, I try to be a pretty even-keeled thinker. I’m objective. That’s my nature. That’s the way I come to decisions. There have been plenty of owners that have fired managers left and right and still aren’t winning. So how well does that work? I don’t know. I’ve got to take a look at any renewal of a contract with any employee and do the best I can to analyze it. Is this person the right fit? Or is this person being detrimental to the organization?”

Girardi, who has three children, has long touted the importance of family. He skipped a game this season at Tampa Bay to attend the high school graduation of his oldest daughter, and he has made it comfortable for players and coaches to leave the team for significant events in their lives. Girardi’s son, a sophomore in high school and a baseball player, occasionally works out with Yankees coaches before games.

Girardi, who had a four-year, $16 million contract, said last week that he would meet with his family after the season to gauge how they felt about him returning. Girardi said he wanted to understand how the grind of the baseball season impacted his children and his wife.

“I’m not living my kids’ lives; I’m not living my wife’s life,” Girardi said during the playoffs. “I’m living, in a sense, my life, so I don’t know what changes for them.”

Now, however, much has changed for Girardi. He is no longer the Yankees’ manager.",Joe Girardi Is Out as Yankees’ Manager,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/baseball/joe-girardi-fired-yankees.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

At Barrington Court in Somerset, where parts of the television series “Wolf Hall” had been filmed, volunteers didn’t mind as our son endlessly toddled up and down a wood-paneled hallway. On our most recent trip in August to Winston Churchill’s family home Chartwell, our son was delighted by the play kitchen in the child-sized playhouse that Churchill built for his own daughters and that the National Trust recently stocked with toys.

As the mother of a now inquisitive preschooler with ninja-like skills at leaping onto antique chairs and fast fingers eager to touch everything new that reaches him, I appreciate even more the risks involved with welcoming children into these homes.

Denise Foster, a manager on a National Trust team to improve visitors’ experiences and a self-described “history nerd,” spent the past seven years working on ways to offer better services for families.

She recognizes that when parents work, these visits are “precious family time where you are building memories together.” Ms. Foster has made sure the cafes have child-sized cutlery and high-chairs that pull up to tables, well-conceived playgrounds, step stools in bathrooms and extra events during school vacations. Volunteers who used to act as guards protecting artifacts are now encouraged to welcome families.

We have an annual family membership that covers more than 500 properties (114.60 pounds, or about $151). Royal Oak Foundation, the U.S. arm of the National Trust, lets visitors buy membership before their trip. We even use National Trust properties as rest stops on long car trips. We broke up one journey and had lunch at The Vyne — a 16th century Tudor Palace in Hampshire, less than an hour’s drive from Heathrow Airport. There our son ran around the grounds and sized up the playground. The grounds we strolled around Dyrham Park, just north of Bath, let our son marvel at herds of deer.

Ms. Foster recognizes that there are limits to how child-friendly she can make homes filled with priceless paintings and furniture. So at homes like at Avebury in Wiltshire, better known as the home of Stonehenge and where the National Trust had produced a television show with the BBC called “The Manor Reborn,” the National Trust kept the replicas after filming finished and welcomed children to play.

2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horror’s rise at the box office over the decades. This year, led by “It” and “Get Out,” really has outpaced all others.

This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves. Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror. Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo . The runaway success of “ It ” (more than $300 million and counting) and “ Get Out ” ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally. “Happy Death Day” was No. 1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit “Saw” franchise, “Jigsaw” (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.

How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades? Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genre’s rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade. Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie. He tried to bring some clarity with a new list. “When ‘It’ came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo,” he wrote in an email. “That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.”

We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror. Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn “The Exorcist” into a $983 million earner).

The 1970s

Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million

In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of “The Exorcist” in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade. That movie aside, horror didn’t make much of an impression that year. And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal. The popularity of “Halloween” in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force. And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of “The Amityville Horror” ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of “Alien” ($80.9 million). That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.

The 1980s

Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million

The slasher genre came into its own in the ’80s, with the introduction of Jason in “Friday the 13th” (1980) and Freddy in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for “Friday” and $370.5 million for “Elm Street”). 1987 was one of the decade’s most profitable. “Elm Street” was in its third installment ($44 million), “The Lost Boys” added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of “Predator” (a movie that probably wouldn’t have existed without the success of “Alien”) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).

The 1990s

Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million

The early part of the ’90s saw few major horror blockbusters. Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late ’80s as the reason for the dip. In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video. “A B-side horror film like ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’ might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late ’80s or early ’90s,” he said. “It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.” Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the “Scream” franchise ($331.7 million). And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via “The Blair Witch Project,” a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.

The Aughts

Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million

The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of “Scream” popularity. While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody “Scary Movie” pulled in $157 million. (It ranked No. 9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama “What Lies Beneath” at No. 10.) Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the “Saw” films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far. And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend. 2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of “Friday the 13th,” a sequel to a reboot of “Halloween” and the sixth entry in the “Saw” series. But the jaw-dropper that year was“Paranormal Activity.” A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.

The 2010s

2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (“Get Out,” “Split,” “Happy Death Day”). But the biggest story is the tremendous run of “It.” That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform. Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend. The real number was $123 million. He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title. “When it came to ‘It,’” Mr. Loria said, “it was just really difficult to track the word ‘It’ across social media to get the snapshot we needed.”",2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/top-horror-movies-box-office-it-get-out.html

The decision marks one of the most aggressive moves by an American social media company against the Russian outlets, which United States intelligence officials have linked to a wide-ranging Kremlin effort, both covert and overt, to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

In 2016, California wildlife officials recorded the highest ever number of stranded otters, 474. That’s up from 299 a decade earlier.

Many of the otters are mortally wounded by sharks. Some show evidence of disease, and others of poisoning linked to the algal blooms that have also been killing sea lions and menacing the state’s fishing industry.

The blooms occur naturally, but researchers believe they are being intensified by runoff that pushes waste and fertilizer into the Pacific. They release a toxin called domoic acid that winds its way through the marine life food chain.

Melissa Miller, a Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian who has overseen hundreds of otter necropsies, said more research was needed to fully understand how domoic acid was harming the otter population.

But she added, “I think we can safely say domoic acid is a big deal in otters. The hard part is how big of a deal.”

Otters are regarded as a keystone species, which means they are essential components of their ecosystem.

That they’re struggling should sound alarm bells not only about potential harms to marine life, but to humans as well, wildlife experts say.

“I see them as sort of a proxy for the bigger issue of land-sea pollution,” said Dr. Miller.

And don’t forget, she added, “We eat a lot of the same things that otters eat. And we clearly see that some of the things that otters are getting are associated with the food that they’re eating.”

A benefit concert for Northern California fire victims is to be headlined by the Bay Area bands Dead & Company and Metallica.

The concert, under the banner Band Together Bay Area, was announced Wednesday as communities continued to reckon with the destruction of more than 8,000 homes and other structures.

The financial impact of the wine country fires is not yet fully known. Moody’s, the credit rating agency, estimated insured losses would total at least $4.6 billion.

The concert will be held Nov. 9 at San Francisco’s AT&T Park with tickets from $50 to $200. Also performing will be Dave Matthews and G-Eazy, an Oakland rapper.

“The recent tragic events up in Napa County, Sonoma County and Mendocino have left us all saddened, left us all flabbergasted and trying to figure out how in some way we could bond together and help,” said Lars Ulrich, Metallica’s drummer, in an announcement video.

All proceeds will go to Tipping Point Community, a nonprofit in San Francisco that works with the poor.

Separately, the concert organizers said $6.5 million in relief aid had been raised from a number of Bay Area businesses, including the San Francisco Giants, Google and Salesforce.

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

“Do I look like a gangster? I’m a businessman!”

Such is life in the world of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, an installment in the long-running video game series that was released 13 years ago today.

Photo

The Grand Theft Auto franchise, an action-adventure series in which players pursue a life of crime, has stretched over 20 years and more than a dozen titles.

With 250 million units sold, it’s one of the most successful franchises in video game history, behind only famous names like Mario and Pokémon.

The games are known for their nonlinear, open-world style, which allows players to cause random mayhem in fictionalized versions of U.S. cities.

As such, the games have long been accused of glamorizing violence. (In 2009, Guinness World Records labeled Grand Theft Auto the most controversial video game series ever, citing more than 4,000 news articles.)

Even so, the series has been a critical success — several titles are among the best-reviewed games of all time — and celebrated for its soundtracks, its voice acting and the sly humor it applies to U.S. culture.

As one character notes, guns blazing, “Ain’t the American dream grand!”

Lawmakers are pushing for regulations for technology companies for the first time in years, encouraged along by big tech’s broad assortment of rivals. For several weeks, a group of companies including smaller tech companies and entertainment and retail businesses has informally begun regular meetings and conference calls to compare notes about Google, Facebook and Amazon and to find a way to join in a stronger opposition force.

“Before, any negativity was a risk for the media business because if you were critical, you could be defined as not getting it and being old school,” said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. “But now the halo is a bit off these companies.”

In recent years, lawmakers have held up technology companies as the epitome of American ingenuity and felt that voters did not want the government to slow them down. That attitude was hardened in 2012, after lawmakers suffered a bruising defeat in a bill to strengthen antipiracy rules for internet companies. The proposals set off huge online protests, aided by the big technology companies, that helped stop the legislation.

“Over the years, I’ve watched as the major tech companies not only sought to protect the unlevel playing field they already had, but have used their political influence to expand it to disadvantage businesses with which they compete,” said Jim Cicconi, who recently retired after years overseeing lobbying at AT&T. “Now I think policymakers are seeing the consequences.”

But even as they sense an opportunity today, the rivals say that challenging the internet companies remains a daunting task. They doubt they can put a dent into the online ad duopoly of Facebook and Google. It will also be difficult, they say, to restrain Amazon’s fast movement into new markets, given the company’s willingness to lose money to gain a foothold.

Internet companies are deploying some of the largest armies in corporate America to battle on Capitol Hill. House and Senate staffs say lobbyists for the big technology companies have swarmed their offices in recent weeks. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sharply increased their lobbying spending — a combined $14.2 million in the third quarter, up from $11.9 million a year earlier. Facebook, which has faced the most scrutiny over the election, increased its third-quarter lobbying budget this year by 40 percent, to $2.85 million.

“It is unfortunate that companies that have been slow to innovate in a changing consumer-first marketplace are looking for wins through regulation or by scoring cheap political points,” said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google.

The tech giants are also lodging a strong defense against the newly proposed regulations. Facebook and Google hired high-profile political operatives to thwart changes in election disclosures at the Federal Election Commission and have deployed lobbyists to water down a bipartisan bill introduced last week that would require social media platforms to disclose the financing behind political ads.

Still, their rivals say that for the first time in many years, criticism of Silicon Valley is getting a receptive audience.

The clearest opening has been in an unpopular battle that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have waged against a bill aimed to curb sex trafficking. The bill would take away some legal protections for sites that knowingly host content that promotes sex trafficking, a move that the internet companies warn could stifle free speech, even though it would largely exempt the big tech companies from liability. Disney, Oracle and 21 Century Fox have endorsed the legislation.

The tech companies initially pushed back vigorously against the bill. In recent weeks, though, some of them have softened their stance, saying they hope to seek a compromise.

“It’s past time to dispel the myth that big internet firms cannot or should not be accountable for their business,” Chip Smith, the executive vice president for global public affairs at 21st Century Fox, “and that includes the personal data they collect and the content and behaviors they promote and profit from online.”

The tech companies are playing defense on other fronts as well. In September, Yelp said it had filed a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. In the complaint, Yelp argued that Google had violated a promise it made to the commission in 2013 that it would not reuse the content of competitors for its own advantage.

Representative Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, recently wrote the commission to ask it disclose information about why it closed its case on Google in 2013. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has asked the agency to reopen its investigation in light of new evidence that surfaced in the case led by European regulators.

In July, the News Media Alliance, which represents 2,000 news organizations including The Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, began advocating for antitrust exemptions that would allow the companies to collectively bargain with Facebook and Google for ad revenue. On Tuesday, David Chavern, president of the group, argued at a House hearing that digital platforms like Google and Facebook should follow the same rules that broadcast and print news organizations do.

“In the fall, you will see us getting increasingly vocal about Google and Facebook and the future of the news business,” Mr. Chavern said in an interview before the hearing.

Even nonprofit consumer interest groups are taking advantage of the situation. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, who is a longtime critic of Google’s collection of personal data, has pushed for online privacy rules and restrictions for self-driving vehicles. He has struggled to get attention in the past, but that is not much of a problem now.

5) 10 A.M. Pastry Fight

Take the subway to the Jiriho z Podebrad station, where you’ll find one of the city’s best farmers markets in full swing in front of the remarkable Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord, a 1932 modernist construction by the Prague Castle architect Joze Plecnik. For an old-school breakfast, stop by the Antoninovo Pekarstvi, a bakery offering excellent kolace (22 koruna), the traditional Czech pastries that inspired the kolache trend in Texas and elsewhere. Then buy a brown-butter (56 koruna), maple-bacon (54 koruna) or vegan chai (56 koruna) doughnut from the new Donut Shop, and sample a similar tale of international pastry conquest in reverse.

6) Noon. Shots and Streetwear

The party-friendly Vinohrady and Zizkov neighborhoods around Jiriho z Podebrad square are known for great bars, but the area also has several alternative clothing boutiques. The new NeverEnough shop sells funky T-shirts from brands like Berlin’s The Dudes, Warsaw’s Turbokolor and Paris-based Yeaaah! Studio, as well as its own line of hoodies. An in-house bar offers cocktails and shots of Bulleit rye. Nearby, Sugar Bat sells women’s rockabilly, goth and swing fashions, including crinoline petticoats (around 1,000 koruna) and an array of vintage-inspired dresses. Farther north, the Botas 66 shop on Krizkovskeho sells footwear modeled on the classic Botas sneakers of Communist Czechoslovakia, a perfect match for a new backpack (1,750 koruna) from the Borivojova street showroom of cult Czech brand Playbag.

7) 2 P.M. Turning Japanese

Two stops on the tram or one stop on the subway will get you to the 2016 arrival Momoichi, a Japanese-inspired “coffetearia” in an airy space carved out of one of Prague’s charismatic 19th-century apartment buildings. Try the fluffy, Hokkaido-style milk bread toast, with rose hip and fragrant orange-blossom jams (130 koruna). More substantial meals include an eye-opening bowl of spicy laksa noodles, redolent with coconut milk and chiles (245 koruna).

8) 3 P.M. Local Designs

Don’t worry about walking off lunch just yet: Next door, the year-old Book Therapy offers Prague’s best collection of reading material on art, architecture and design, most of which is in English. For a local souvenir, ask for the coffee-table volume on the great photographer Josef Sudek (1,699 koruna) or Vladislav Rostoka and Dusan Junek’s “Typografikum,” a masterpiece of graphic design (1,890 koruna), or choose from the small collection of home furnishings, like the set of hand-turned wooden bowls from the east Bohemian town of Dobruska (699 koruna).

9) 4 P.M. By the Bite

Until recently, the area to the north of Wenceslas Square and east of the trendy shopping on Na Prikope street has been relatively uninteresting. But new attractions like Spejle are luring people to Jindrisska street. Spejle takes its name from the skewer used to serve almost everything it offers. Ask for a glass of a dry Czech white wine from a producer like Horak (90 koruna) and pair it with any of the dozens of tapas-style dishes, all priced at 29 koruna per skewer. You can sample Czech classics in just a few bites: Traditional recipes include gingery roast duck with braised red cabbage, and juicy baked bucek, or pork belly, with a dollop of mashed potatoes and apple-horseradish sauce.

10) 6 P.M. Compare and Contrast

Find more funky design across the street at Freshlabels, with two shops around the corner from each other. On Jindrisska, the main outpost stocks obscure European clothing brands, including colorful footwear by Sweden’s Happy Socks and Komono watches from Belgium, as well as jackets, coats and eyewear. A few steps away on Panska street, the Freshlabels backpack store stocks some 300 cool bags, like the “paper” knapsacks from Berlin’s Ucon Acrobatics. Walk around the corner to the Passage of Czech Design, on the ground-floor passageway of the Czech National Bank building. This long walkway was recently converted into a gallery, displaying the work of both up-and-coming and established Czech designers.

11) 8 P.M. Italian Empire

For centuries, Prague has benefited from Italian influences. One of the most important today is the mini-empire of chef Riccardo Lucque, who owns several standard-setting restaurants. His most recent has changed the atmosphere on somewhat rundown Havlickova street, installing the comfortable bistro and deli La Bottega Linka in the overlooked area just north of the Masarykovo Nadrazi train station. Main courses include excellent fresh pastas, chops and roasts, though the kitchen seems to come into its own with seafood: juicy, lightly seared scallops with crisp pancetta and a tangy Caesar salad, and perfectly roasted whole turbot or John Dory.

None of these certified running guide dogs has yet to take part in a race, but on Oct. 29 Mr. Panek and Gus hope to reach this milestone when they run the Poland Spring Marathon Kickoff, a five-mile race in Central Park, without human assistance. This will also be a first for the race’s organizer, New York Road Runners, which after much discussion agreed to officially allow Gus to run.

On a recent sunny afternoon, Mr. Panek was sitting in Tavern on the Green with Gus napping by his feet, cooling off after a six-mile jog around the Central Park loop.

“Gus sets the pace,” he said, “and I follow him.” Trotting at a nine-minute-mile clip, Gus, 5, is trained to avoid obstacles, slow down for congestion and, above all, keep Mr. Panek safe. Gus runs only when he feels confident there’s no danger, and he is trained to ignore commands that seem risky.

Moving with abundant caution and focus, he is unfazed by the steady flow of bicycles, horses, pedestrians and other dogs streaming past in both directions. As they run, Mr. Panek, who is tall with a graceful stride, often says “yes,” a keyword command that assures Gus everything is going well. And he praises him, saying, “Good job!” and “Good boy, Gus!” as the dog navigates the route while dressed in his own running gear — a specially designed harness that offers greater mobility than his usual one.

Guiding Eyes estimates that it costs about $50,000 to raise and train each dog (as well as provide lifetime care), with all funding coming from donations. Just one-third of the Labrador retrievers and German shepherds it breeds end up graduating from the guide dog program. Some that don’t make it enter other lines of work, such as bomb detection.

In contrast to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon took repeated turns at playing the madman. In 1969, during negotiations with North Vietnam, he sent a squadron of 18 nuclear-armed B-52s toward Moscow and staged a worldwide nuclear readiness alert, all to appear so unbalanced that the Soviets would pressure Hanoi to give in. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war,” he told his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman.

Historians continue to debate how effective Nixon’s maneuver was; the Soviet Union was taken aback, but then again the American role in the war lasted three and a half more years. But it’s also important to remember that Nixon was not in fact a madman and chose his “irrational” moves with precision. An old foreign-policy hand, he knew exactly whom he was dealing with in Moscow and Hanoi, and could predict with reasonable accuracy how they would react. Yet even then, the results were inconclusive.

Put differently, the short history of nuclear confrontation demonstrates that effectively controlling the risks of nuclear war depends acutely on the personality of a particular president. It matters greatly that the world assumed Nixon was rational, and that many in the world harbor concerns about Mr. Trump. There is a crucial difference between playing against type to introduce new doubts and playing to type to reinforce existing ones. For example, critical to Nixon’s strategy was what he said to Haldeman — that he’d been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in. But does anyone think Mr. Trump would do the same?

Consider the discombobulated way his administration has approached North Korea. Some members of his national security team are apparently trying to apply the sort of approach that the Cuban missile crisis enshrined, emphasizing diplomatic and economic pressure and characterizing military measures as a last resort. But Mr. Trump himself has frustrated and undermined them, doubling down on his own wayward improvisations by belittling Mr. Kim personally and proclaiming he “won’t be around much longer.” Meanwhile, he has undercut American diplomatic efforts on issues from the Iran nuclear deal to trade negotiations.

His threats to North Korea aren’t a case of temporary madness; they’re standard operating procedure. It’s hard to see the North Koreans backing down in hopes that Mr. Trump will return to reason and be a stable, rational negotiating partner.

The real risk here is that Mr. Trump does not actually understand the scope of the challenge he faces on the Korean Peninsula — and that he may in fact mean what he says in his threats. Any of the United States’ three basic offensive options — an all-out preventive attack on North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities; a limited attack on those sites; or surgical special operations to overthrow or “decapitate” the regime — could set off North Korean artillery barrages against the people of Seoul (and the nearly 30,000 American military personnel in South Korea) and wider war in the region, potentially up to the nuclear level.

Mr. Trump may be clueless about nuclear strategy and incapable of empathizing with the South Koreans. But even he should blanch at immersing the United States in a destructive, unnecessary and ignominious war in Asia.",The Madness Behind Trump’s ‘Madman’ Strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/the-madness-behind-trumps-madman-strategy.html

Court papers unsealed on Wednesday accuse both Mr. Spota and Mr. McPartland of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.","In an indictment unsealed on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Central Islip, N.Y., federal prosecutors accused Mr. Spota, 76, and Christopher McPartland, 51, one of the district attorney’s top deputies, of participating in that cover-up. Federal prosecutors accused them of holding a series of meetings and phone conversations with Mr. Burke and other police officers in which they agreed to conceal Mr. Burke’s role in the assault and to impede the federal investigation.

Mr. Spota remains in office, but he had already announced that he would not seek re-election in November. Mr. Spota has been district attorney since 2002, and he initially earned praise for pursuing corrupt officials in local towns, and for spearheading an inquiry into how Roman Catholic Church officials on Long Island had protected pedophile priests.

Mr. Spota and Mr. Burke had been close for years. They met in the late 1970s, when Mr. Burke, then a teenager, was the star witness in a murder case involving a 13-year-old boy whose body was found with six rocks jammed down his throat. Mr. Spota, then an assistant district attorney, prosecuted the case.

Mr. Burke went on to become a police officer, and after Mr. Spota was elected district attorney he brought Mr. Burke to his office as a top investigator, and later pushed him as a candidate to become the top uniformed officer on the county police force, which is overseen by a civilian commissioner. With Mr. Spota’s backing, Mr. Burke became the chief in 2012.

He was initially a relatively popular figure: a gregarious lawman, complete with mustache and lit cigar, who spoke of bringing modern police management techniques to the department.

But Mr. Burke also launched a number of questionable investigations, some involving dubious surveillance methods. A federal prosecutor in late 2015 described one of his acts — having a GPS device installed on the car of a rival police official — as “something out of the K.G.B.”

And Mr. Burke seemed eager to pick arguments with federal agencies. He withdrew his detectives from a federal task force focused on gangs, a decision that in retrospect is all the more troubling, as M.S. 13 has been blamed for 17 murders in one recent 18-month stretch in Suffolk County.

Investigators, along with the Suffolk County district attorney’s office, at one point spurned help from the F.B.I. amid an investigation into a serial killer who was dumping the bodies of murdered prostitutes along a desolate stretch of roadway near Gilgo Beach.

But it was not one of these high-profile cases that led to his undoing. Instead, it was his decision to confront and rough up Mr. Loeb, the heroin user who had stolen the bag of pornography and sex toys from his car. Initially, Mr. Loeb was prosecuted in Suffolk County, where Mr. McPartland, a high-ranking lawyer in Mr. Spota’s office, handled the case. Later, the prosecution of Mr. Loeb was handed off to a special prosecutor, an assistant district attorney in Queens, who secured a conviction.

Court papers unsealed on Wednesday accuse both Mr. Spota and Mr. McPartland of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. But the papers, filed by federal prosecutors, offer little detailed information beyond accusing Mr. Spota and Mr. McPartland of pressuring several unnamed witnesses to lie to federal agents, to give false testimony under oath, and to withhold information from grand jurors.

“Instead of upholding their oaths, these defendants allegedly abused the power of the Suffolk County district attorney’s office,” Bridget M. Rohde, the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Mr. Spota entered a not guilty plea.

Outside of the federal courthouse in Central Islip, Mr. Spota’s attorney, Alan Vinegrad, asserted his client’s innocence.

“Tom Spota committed no crime,” Mr. Vinegrad said. “In fact, for many years of a very long and distinguished career, Tom had worked hard to investigate and prosecute crime, and deliver justice to the residents of Suffolk County. Tom categorically denies the government’s charges, and he looks forward to vindicating himself in court.”",Suffolk Prosecutor Charged With Obstructing Police Assault Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/nyregion/spota-district-attorney-suffolk-indicted.html

You’d be surprised how often identity theft comes down to misplaced or stolen documents. A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.

The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.

Wirecutter recommends the Amazon Basics 12-Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder, which can also handle CDs and old credit cards.

Tools to Keep Those Cables Under Control

Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They’re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.

Wirecutter’s favorites — and mine — are Velcro One Wrap Thin Ties. A pack of 100 is only $10, and you can reuse them over and over.

And while you’re getting all of those cables in order, also think about picking up an extra laptop charger and charging cable. The last thing you want is to get home, open your laptop to work and realize you forgot your charger at the office or in another room.

A Quality USB Headset

Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don’t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you’ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.

Wirecutter likes the Jabra UC Voice 550 Duo, which is light enough to wear for long periods, and also offers superior voice and sound quality. It’s also easy to set up: Just plug it in to your computer and it’s ready to use.

A Lap Desk, for Those Couch Working Sessions

I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that working from home sometimes means working in bed or working from the couch in front of the TV. (Call it an office perk.)

When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn’t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.

Wirecutter recommends the Lapgear XL Executive Mahogany Lap Desk, which is not only comfortable but also as attractive as its name suggests.

In contrast to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon took repeated turns at playing the madman. In 1969, during negotiations with North Vietnam, he sent a squadron of 18 nuclear-armed B-52s toward Moscow and staged a worldwide nuclear readiness alert, all to appear so unbalanced that the Soviets would pressure Hanoi to give in. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war,” he told his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman.

Historians continue to debate how effective Nixon’s maneuver was; the Soviet Union was taken aback, but then again the American role in the war lasted three and a half more years. But it’s also important to remember that Nixon was not in fact a madman and chose his “irrational” moves with precision. An old foreign-policy hand, he knew exactly whom he was dealing with in Moscow and Hanoi, and could predict with reasonable accuracy how they would react. Yet even then, the results were inconclusive.

Put differently, the short history of nuclear confrontation demonstrates that effectively controlling the risks of nuclear war depends acutely on the personality of a particular president. It matters greatly that the world assumed Nixon was rational, and that many in the world harbor concerns about Mr. Trump. There is a crucial difference between playing against type to introduce new doubts and playing to type to reinforce existing ones. For example, critical to Nixon’s strategy was what he said to Haldeman — that he’d been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in. But does anyone think Mr. Trump would do the same?

Consider the discombobulated way his administration has approached North Korea. Some members of his national security team are apparently trying to apply the sort of approach that the Cuban missile crisis enshrined, emphasizing diplomatic and economic pressure and characterizing military measures as a last resort. But Mr. Trump himself has frustrated and undermined them, doubling down on his own wayward improvisations by belittling Mr. Kim personally and proclaiming he “won’t be around much longer.” Meanwhile, he has undercut American diplomatic efforts on issues from the Iran nuclear deal to trade negotiations.

His threats to North Korea aren’t a case of temporary madness; they’re standard operating procedure. It’s hard to see the North Koreans backing down in hopes that Mr. Trump will return to reason and be a stable, rational negotiating partner.

The real risk here is that Mr. Trump does not actually understand the scope of the challenge he faces on the Korean Peninsula — and that he may in fact mean what he says in his threats. Any of the United States’ three basic offensive options — an all-out preventive attack on North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities; a limited attack on those sites; or surgical special operations to overthrow or “decapitate” the regime — could set off North Korean artillery barrages against the people of Seoul (and the nearly 30,000 American military personnel in South Korea) and wider war in the region, potentially up to the nuclear level.

Mr. Panetta said Mr. Kelly’s attack on a congresswoman reflected his lack of experience in high-level politics.","“He is a Marine first and foremost,” Mr. Panetta said. “In addition to being a Marine, he was born and raised in Boston” among blue-collar families with traditional views about God and country. “You combine those two and you realize” that he “shares some of these deep values, some of which Trump himself has tried to talk about.”

As tall and commanding in a suit as he was in a uniform, Mr. Kelly has become a central figure in Mr. Trump’s orbit. After six months in the cabinet as secretary of homeland security, Mr. Kelly took over a turbulent and tribal White House last summer and by most accounts imposed more order on the building and staff, if not the Twitter-obsessed president himself.

Mr. Kelly’s focus on improving information flow and decision making in the West Wing gave the impression of a good soldier mainly concerned with process. But that obscured a player who expresses his own sharp views in selected areas, most notably immigration, where he shares Mr. Trump’s commitment to toughening the border and deporting many in the country illegally. His views were forged in part by his time heading the United States Southern Command, which oversees American military operations and security in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.

Mr. Kelly not only expressed willingness to curb refugees coming into the country — in the end, Mr. Trump lowered the cap to 45,000 — he embraced Mr. Trump’s various attempts to close the border to visitors from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. He aggressively turned up the heat on internal immigration enforcement, stepping up deportation of undocumented immigrants, even those without serious criminal records, reversing an Obama administration policy.

Under Mr. Kelly’s leadership, the Department of Homeland Security also went after undocumented parents who bring their children into the country. He directed immigration officials to lodge smuggling charges against the parents, saying they were putting children in danger.

“Kelly has been an enabler of Trump’s mission,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant homeland security secretary under Mr. Obama. “Judge him that way.”

His image as a steady, nonideological figure trying to restore order in the White House in the face of a radical president, she added, was not true. Mr. Kelly, she said, was not “the savior or the hostage.”

Other Democrats have expressed alarm at Mr. Kelly’s views on immigration. At a dinner including Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Kelly gave an extended critique of Mexico, calling it a third-world country in danger of collapsing the way Venezuela has and arguing that the United States needed to guard itself against that, according to people informed about the conversation.

But Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who recommended Mr. Kelly to Mr. Trump last winter, said the retired general’s background gave him an understanding of the dangers and drawbacks of unfettered immigration. “He knows a lot of the challenges that we face south of the border,” Mr. Cotton said, adding that the issue is “something that he’s lived on a firsthand basis for years.”

Like Mr. Panetta, he pointed to Mr. Kelly’s upbringing.

“I think he appreciates the struggles of America’s working class — the blue-collar workers over the last 30, 40 years, the kind of people who have to take a shower after they get off work, not before they go to work — and the impact that mass unskilled and low-skilled immigration has had on working-class wages in our society,” Mr. Cotton said.

As a cabinet officer, Mr. Kelly frequently lashed out at critics. In March, during a meeting with members of Arab and Muslim communities in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Kelly threatened to walk out after being posed hard questions about the travel ban and what participants saw as the targeting of Muslim Americans at ports of entry, according to people in attendance.

During a speech in April, Mr. Kelly rebuked members of Congress who complained about what they called overly aggressive immigration enforcement.

“If lawmakers do not like the laws they’ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws,” Mr. Kelly said defiantly. “Otherwise, they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.”

That drew a rebuke from Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “I don’t think it’s correct for you to tell members of Congress to shut up,” he said.

Mr. Kelly has also engaged in testy public debates with Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California. During a June meeting, Ms. Harris and Mr. Kelly engaged in a contentious back-and-forth as she questioned him about Trump administration threats to cut off funding for so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

All of that foreshadowed his attack last week on Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who publicly accused Mr. Trump of insensitivity when he called the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, who was killed this month in Niger. Mr. Kelly called her an “empty barrel” and told an unflattering story about her that was proved untrue by videotape of the event he mentioned.

Mr. Kelly decided himself to head out to the White House briefing room to defend the president, colleagues said, and most of his remarks reflected on his own experience as the father of a slain Marine and the nature of military service. He brought tears to the eyes of other White House aides, who afterward traded emails expressing admiration for Mr. Kelly’s passionate defense of Mr. Trump. It was only afterward that they began to see how the attack on Ms. Wilson came to overshadow the emotion of the first part of his speech.

Mr. Kelly was surprised by the criticism of his speech, colleagues said, but he has not apologized to Ms. Wilson for making false statements about her. White House officials said they opted against it to avoid extending the story.

Mr. Panetta said Mr. Kelly’s attack on a congresswoman reflected his lack of experience in high-level politics. “He knows where the land mines are in the Marines, but he doesn’t know where the land mines are in politics,” Mr. Panetta said. “And he’ll make mistakes as a result, and he certainly made mistakes last week in going after people in that news conference.”

But, he said, it was authentic: “As somebody who worked with this guy, a lot of what he got up to say is a reflection of who John Kelly is.”","Pitched as Calming Force, John Kelly Instead Mirrors Boss’s Priorities",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/trump-kelly.html

“We are also so different now,” Mr. Kail said.
“There is a lot of pain,” Ms. Vardalos said.","This wasn’t the first time that someone in the Newman Theater had reacted emotionally to a monologue by Ms. Vardalos or one of her three castmates, in the play she adapted from Cheryl Strayed’s book of the same name, based on her long-running online advice column, “Dear Sugar.” It is now in its second iteration at the Public after a critically acclaimed run last fall. (Ms. Strayed now collaborates with Steve Almond on the Sweet Spot column for the Thursday Styles section of The New York Times and its accompanying podcast Dear Sugars.)

Earlier that evening, in fact, another young woman, sitting in the third row, started crying at the point when Sugar told of how her mother had never lived to see her granddaughter wear the red dress the two women had bought impulsively at a yard sale years earlier.

And she started up again — this time more loudly — near the end of the show when the character played by Teddy Cañez narrated the tale of a father who had lost his only son at age 22.

“I felt I had to carry her through the show,” Ms. Vardalos said. “We must listen constantly, not just to each other, acting and reacting, but also to what is going on in the audience. Because the audience becomes part of the performance.”

Any play is going to have its challenges, of course, from complicated monologues to quicksilver scene changes to the distractions of cellphones going off or someone snoring away in the front row. (“Oh, yes, I’ve seen that as well,” Ms. Vardalos said.)

But “Tiny Beautiful Things,” with its tales of untimely death, a miscarriage that still haunts years later and sexual assault — all taken from the letters written to Ms. Strayed and then her often deeply personal responses — has an emotional rawness that seems to grab audiences in unexpected ways. (Of course, not every story is a sad one: At least one monologue, about a sexy Santa, gets laughs every night.)

“If you have 300 people in the theater, then the odds are someone is there on the anniversary of someone they loved passing away, or maybe of a relationship ending,” said the director Thomas Kail. “So something that may mean nothing to you might resonate deeply with the person sitting behind you.”

After a recent Sunday matinee, four old friends — two visiting from Canada, two living in New York — gathered on the sidewalk outside the Public to reflect on the play they had just seen.

“It was like group therapy,” Carolyn McAskie, 71, said to her friends, laughing.

“I know,” responded Roxanne Carrillo, 65. “I believe it was 90 minutes, but it felt much shorter, like I had just left a 50-minute session with my shrink.”

On another night, Monique Bernstein, 28, stood in the lobby of the Public, holding a program for Ms. Vardalos to autograph while wiping away traces of the tears she had shed during the last extended monologue, about the father mourning his son.

“I had read the book and I loved it,” she said. “But there is something about seeing it with an audience, as opposed to just reading a book by yourself, that is sort of a bonding experience. Like there was a woman sniffling behind me, and I’m like, ‘I don’t feel so bad!’”

It’s been almost exactly a year since “Tiny Beautiful Things” was staged at the Public the first time around, selling out its brief run, and both Ms. Vardalos and Mr. Kail (a Tony Award winner for “Hamilton”) say they see small but significant differences in how audiences are now reacting.

The theater itself may be one reason the tears seem to be flowing so freely in the current production. Mr. Kail said the move to larger house — the original venue, the Shiva Theater, held 99 seats; the Newman, more than three times that — has made the experience more intimate, not less so, by letting the audience “slip into the anonymity of darkness.”

The Newman is both narrow and deep, with lights from the stage reflecting only on audience members in the first few rows.

“There is something about the length of the theater, and the darkness that unfolds, that allows deep reactions to come out,” Mr. Kail said. “And that was one of the questions we had when we first started working on this: Can we bring a group of people together, people who have never met, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the dark, and really get them to unlock?”

Mr. Kail said he was in the audience the night the young woman burst into her howl of anguish. “Each person on that stage, all four of them, were affected in their own way,” he said. “They each had to grapple with what it meant to hear someone who was clearly in pain. It opened up and expanded the show in ways I hadn’t seen on other nights.”

After each performance, Ms. Vardalos exits through the lobby of the Public, signing autographs, posing for selfies, even laughing and joking with people who might have been choking back tears in their seats a few minutes earlier but now are thrilled to meet the star of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.”

But not every night.

“Sometimes, I will have been so affected by what happens in the audience, that I don’t come out right away,” she said. “I need to just sit by myself. I know people are waiting — and as actors, we aim to please — but there are times I can’t come out. I just can’t.”

Both she and Mr. Kail say they believe that there is something beyond the changed physical space that is causing such profound emotional reactions this time around. And that is the country itself.

Deep wounds that remain from a divisive presidential election. White supremacists marching in Charlottesville. The massacre in Las Vegas. Hurricanes in Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico. The threat of nuclear war with North Korea. All are factors the two believe may make people hungry to find comfort in the theater.

“We are also so different now,” Mr. Kail said.

“There is a lot of pain,” Ms. Vardalos said. “And I think that Cheryl’s words are a salve for the pain we are going through.”","‘Cry as Loud as You Want.’ In This Audience, They Really Do.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/theater/tiny-beautiful-things-cheryl-strayed-public-theater.html

Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful.
For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.
Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government.
A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants.","Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year’s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.

On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five — Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.

But there is little to suggest we’ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants’ vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.

“Individuals, lawmakers, we’re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,” said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable — so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.

Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)

“Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,” Mr. Lynn said. “Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I’d bet a lot of money a year from now we’ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.”

Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we’ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They’re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.

They’re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence — a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.

But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets — Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.

Apple’s iPhone is the world’s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.

Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon’s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart’s sun.

Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five’s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.

“We’ve all become a bit cyborg,” writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in “World Without Mind,” one of several new books examining the giants. “What we need to always remember is that we’re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.”

The complicated nature of the Five’s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.

Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon’s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.

Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it’s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn’t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.

That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn’t done much in office to carry that out. Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.

Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.

“We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,” said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.

Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company’s culture — which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.

A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today’s tech giants. But that’s a big if.

“The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?” Mr. Reback said. “Had we been more diligent, we wouldn’t have nearly the problems we have today.”",Can Washington Stop Big Tech Companies?

Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

How can we recover?) and some that might occur only to her (What if an affair is good for a marriage?). She doesn’t dispense advice as much as scratch at orthodoxies, and pose questions with wit and a Continental exasperation with American mores. Our obsession with transparency, total disclosure and suffocating intimacy stanches desire, she argues — “fire needs air.” Furthermore, our expectations have gotten all out of hand. “Lovers today seek to bring under one roof desires that have forever had separate dwellings,” she writes.

There is an aura of Gulliver about her; it’s as if she can’t believe how small Americans have made their lives, how we’ve settled for coziness and peaceably binge-watching the weekend away. The matter of the erotic has gravity for her. Her parents were Holocaust survivors, and the only ones from their families to make it out of the camps. Later, they moved to a community of survivors in Belgium, where Perel distinguished between two types of people: those who were alive and those who didn’t die. Her parents “understood the erotic as an antidote to death,” she once said.

As a writer, Perel is nimble and playful, and she knows her way around a phrase. We can hear these qualities on the podcast, where her good ear and gentle teasing produce quick complicity with each client.

But as a thinker, she’s essentially a synthesizer — albeit a talented and confident one. “The State of Affairs” is a patchwork of (mostly attributed) common references. The concept she’s most associated with — that we are torn between our desires for adventure and security — comes from the work of the psychoanalyst Stephen A. Mitchell and others. The tone — wry, worldly, aphoristic — owes much to Alain de Botton and Adam Phillips’s amused laments on coupling and its discontents. But the biggest debt she owes might be to herself; she trots out some favorite jokes and epigrams from “Mating in Captivity.” On occasion, she dusts off and repurposes whole chunks of text with minor tweaks.

Perel writes: “Mine is not an evidenced-based scientific survey, nor is it a sociological study based on data collected by the various websites for people seeking affairs. Rather, my approach is akin to that of an anthropologist and an explorer. I talk to people, and I listen.”

This is true, but I’ve always found the pleasure of reading Perel or listening to her (when she’s not repeating herself) lies in how literary her approach is. In case studies, she gives us each partner’s account — and then unravels them, pulling on this strand and that, investigating the stories we tell about ourselves, where these stories come from and who they serve. On the podcast, we can hear her practicing a supple kind of literary criticism, on the fly, in front of the authors.

Her ambitions for clients and readers are literary, too — she wants them to develop more plots in their lives, more possibilities. She wants them to live without easy, limiting certainties: “Reconciling the erotic and the domestic is not a problem to solve; it is a paradox to manage.” And the script we have inherited when it comes to infidelity is pitifully narrow, its language cribbed from addiction and criminalization: “Clinicians often label the faithful spouse as the ‘injured party’ and the unfaithful one as the ‘perpetrator.’”

Perel takes a broader, global view. “An entire cultural framework shapes the way we give meaning to our heartbreak,” she writes. In her work in India, Argentina and across Europe, she’s seen a variety of responses to infidelity — indifference, outrage, tacit acceptance, vocal acceptance.

She has also seen a variety of reasons that people stray: “One person may cross the border for a simple fling, while another is looking to emigrate. Some infidelities are petty rebellions, sparked by a sense of ennui, a desire for novelty, or the need to know one still has pulling power.”

Like other writers on sex — Emily Witt and Dan Savage come to mind — Perel is inspired by communities of queer and polyamorous people; “monogamy’s dissidents,” she calls them, who are rethinking the boundaries of the couple. It’s an idea that’s easy to dismiss as outré but, Perel reminds us, so was premarital sex not so long ago.

This is the kind of maneuver that makes Perel so bracing to read, this quick pivot to remind us how culturally specific our traditions are and, in some cases, how new. She doesn’t peddle in bromides or offer a shoulder to cry on — she’s too busy trying to shake you to your senses, insisting on your agency, your vitality and your complicity in what happens in your marriage. She’s a tonic, and sometimes a tough one to swallow.

As Alexandre Dumas wrote, “The bonds of wedlock are so heavy that it takes two to carry them, sometimes three.” We’re lucky to have Perel help bear the burden — but also to challenge us, to ask us why we accept it as natural in the first place.",‘The State of Affairs’ Examines Our Cheating Hearts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/books/review-state-of-affairs-rethinking-infidelity-esther-perel.html

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

For a different example, look to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In the spring the museum erected an outdoor sculpture by the artist Sam Durant that replicated the gallows where 38 Dakota people were executed in 1862.

After an outcry that the work appeared to be a monument to a massacre, the museum convened a mediation session that included the artist, parks officials, museum staff members and, most important, Dakota elders. They decided to destroy the work by burying it, ceding any materials and intellectual property to the Dakota along the way.

Was that “censorship”? The work was removed, but in a creative way that arguably added more meaning to the work than it ever would have had it remained standing.

In some ways, the emptying out of “Theater of the World” also made it more meaningful. Huang Yong Ping, the Paris-based Chinese provocateur behind that work, has frequently been censored. His work “Bat Project II,” a reproduction of part of an American spy plane that crashed into a Chinese fighter, was withdrawn from the 2002 Guangzhou Triennial. The depression that the artwork left in the ground remained, however, as a haunting trace of the original work. Whether intentional or not, this sort of lasting reminder of a work should be an inspiration for how museums can handle controversial works: removal, but not erasure.

For another example, look to how artists responded to the Whitney Biennial. Parker Bright occupied the space in front of the Till painting on several days with text written across his shirt: “No lynch mob” and “Black death spectacle.” His intervention confronted viewers with the reality of a physical body, not just an abstraction of one.

A banner that Pastiche Lumumba hung from the High Line, which runs alongside the Whitney, drew attention to the way that history is not yet past: “The white woman whose lies got Emmett Till lynched is still alive in 2017. Feel old yet?” For observers like myself, this performance was more compelling than the original painting.

Social media has changed how we communicate, and social inequity continues to differentiate how we feel. These dynamics are changing the way we curate. For one thing, the work of exhibition-making no longer ends when the show opens. Instead, it continues as a process of listening, a public performance that goes on for months.

In some way, as curator Hera Chan points out, the dynamics of the platform economy threaten to make curatorial expertise obsolete. Who needs us when institutions can figure out, thanks to social media, crowdsourcing and machine learning, audience preferences quickly and accurately? The difficult question of who “we” are, when we are faced with a controversial artwork, is the curator’s only remaining raison d’être. Consider that exhibitions don’t have a standard rating system, like movies or music — at some level, we must believe that every show should be accessible to all of us. Like churches or public television in a different age, museums are now our civic institutions, where we go to argue about who counts as “us.”

The “should it stay or should it go” approach fumbles the opportunity to broaden and enrich what that “us” is. It’s a difficult question, and we will not agree, but even asking it together creates a kind of community. It falls to curators to facilitate this conversation. Institutions, following the lead of artists, should respond creatively to the call for censorship.

They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case.
In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota.
Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?

“I just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,” she said of her son’s punishment. “And pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.”","‘Willing to Do Everything,’ Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

In the hospital, Geraldine’s family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.
“People don’t know what they’re in for,” Geraldine’s daughter reflected after the funeral.
Geraldine’s family was kind enough to agree.","“We can place a long-term breathing tube in her neck and a feeding tube in her stomach,” I said, “but there are no cases in the medical literature of someone like her living independently again. The best we could hope for is a life of near-complete dependence.”

“When we first came to the hospital, doctors told us my mom might be brain-dead,” one of Geraldine’s daughters countered. “Now, she takes breaths on her own sometimes. She’s already improving.”

Just as Geraldine was stubborn and exceptional in life, her family believed she would be exceptional in beating her prognosis.

“It might be different if my mom was 70 or 80,” her daughter went on, “but she’s only 56.”

For Geraldine’s family, the immediate fear of watching her die outweighed the unfamiliar pain of sustaining her on machines and watching her disappear in a long-term care facility.

Our medical team had seen hundreds of people like Geraldine, most of whom returned to the hospital month after month to manage complications of immobility. Sparse cases of recoveries were overwhelmed by painful, expensive, drawn-out deaths, ones we would never wish for ourselves or our own families.

But for Geraldine’s family, every decision was new. For them, nobody was like Geraldine.

In every other part of medicine, doctors make recommendations for medications, lifestyle changes and surgeries. We don’t offer cancer patients six different chemotherapy regimens and ask them to weigh the pros and cons. Yet when it comes to end-of-life decisions, doctors are terrified of violating patient autonomy. We are scared of our own medical opinions.

Instead of saying, “I recommend...,” we often offer a platter of life-prolonging measures, most of which are unlikely to improve a patient’s quality of life, but which offer the possibility of hope. The patient’s heart will still beat. Her personality will be gone, but her chest will still rise and collapse. Families see an opportunity for loss to be delayed, perhaps even dodged. Then we are surprised when they take us up on the offer to prolong dying.

“I think she would want more time to try and recover,” Geraldine’s daughter said.

So we kept Geraldine alive. A plastic breathing tube sprouted from her neck and a feeding tube with peach-colored formula buried itself in her stomach.

In the hospital, Geraldine’s family learned the common complications of immobility: infection, blood clots and bedsores.

When the infection started, a fever sounded the alarm. We counted the possible causes. Geraldine had a breathing tube in her windpipe, a feeding tube in her stomach and an IV line in her neck, each an access road for bacteria. Lying in bed put her at risk for pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Like mosquitoes in standing water, infections proliferate when the body is still.

Geraldine’s blood clots weren’t a surprise. Medical students are inculcated with the famous triad of conditions that predispose patients to clots, and Geraldine had all of them. Her body was inflamed and torn from the heart attack, infections and procedures that caused her blood vessels to release molecules that helped blood to clot. Lying in a hospital bed, not moving anything unless it was moved, her circulation slowed. Pools of static blood dried into a thick paste in her blood vessels.

Thanks to aggressive nursing care, when Geraldine developed a bedsore it was managed at an early stage. But the term “bedsore” is an understated euphemism. It recalls the annoyance of a cold sore or the tenderness of muscles after the gym. The grotesque image of bone pressing through skin is hidden.

In people who are immobilized, bedsores develop under bony prominences like the heels and the skull. At first, the skin becomes red. If the bedsore progresses, the skin’s outer layer, then the inner layer, breaks down. Finally, in the most severe stage, bone, muscles and tendons are exposed. The entire process can happen in just a few days.

Sixty days after her heart attack, Geraldine was stable enough to leave the I.C.U. She was in a persistent vegetative state — unresponsive to external stimuli. She opened her eyes, as if she were about to say something, but nothing ever came out. Her gaze roved around the room. An ambulance took her to a long term care facility, where she was dependent on machines and people.

“When you first hear someone you love is sick, you think it’s a short term thing,” her daughter told me over the phone a month later. “It’s adjusting to the long term aspect that’s hard.” Geraldine’s daughter woke up at 5 a.m. every day to spend time with her mom before work.

“I think it’s more of a disappointment for my dad,” she said. “He told us that if he ever gets sick, he doesn’t want any of this.”

Geraldine’s family lived between hope and guilt, with the weight of each side in flux. “If my mom knew what we were doing right now, she’d probably be mad at us,” her daughter reflected a few weeks ago.

Yet in the same breath, her voice rose and she said: “My mom’s a fighter, so I think she would be happy with us giving her a shot. We’re hoping for this miraculous turnaround.”

It did not come. Geraldine died of sepsis earlier this month, after more than four months of care.

“People don’t know what they’re in for,” Geraldine’s daughter reflected after the funeral. “It hurt all of us to see her like that.”

In the final days of Geraldine’s life, a doctor asked if the family of another patient in the I.C.U. could visit Geraldine to see what prolonged dying looked like. Geraldine’s family was kind enough to agree.

The visiting family chose to transition their loved one to hospice care.",The Symptoms of Protracted Dying,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/well/live/the-symptoms-of-protracted-dying.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Life settlement still looks somewhat tricky to navigate, but it’s an option to keep in mind.","If a life-settlement company likes its odds of turning a profit, it will buy the policy, paying out more than the policy’s cash value — the amount received if the policy were canceled — but less than the face value, or death benefit.

The firm acquires the policy and continues paying the premiums. Then the company (or a big investor who buys bundles of policies) collects when the seller dies. It’s something like a reverse mortgage, but on your life instead of your house.

“There are so many seniors sitting on these assets, and they’re throwing them away,” said Chris Orestis, executive vice president of GWG Life, who points out that most Americans simply let policies lapse.

For now, life settlement remains a seldom-used option. About 1,650 Americans received settlements for their policies last year, according to statistics compiled annually by journalist Donna Horowitz for The Deal, a financial publication.

But the industry, which previously targeted the very affluent, has begun courting middle-class people who own policies with face values of $100,000 to $500,000. Moreover, in a business once heavily reliant on brokers as intermediaries, several companies now market directly to consumers — like Coventry, the largest life-settlement provider, which runs national TV ads.

GWG Life works with nursing homes and assisted living chains to reach people contemplating the daunting costs of long-term care. The policyholder can set up an irrevocable bank account to funnel the proceeds of the sale directly to a care provider.

The company’s strategy, as articulated by Mr. Orestis: “When a family walks into a community and says, ‘Jeez, we can’t afford this,’ everyone in the long-term care industry should say, ‘Do you have a life insurance policy?’”

Odds are, then, that you’ll be hearing more about this possibility. A business that began with so-called viatical settlements at the height of the AIDS epidemic is now coming after older adults.

Sometimes, selling makes sense. Older people may no longer need life insurance bought to protect a spouse who has since died or children who have reached financial independence. Perhaps rising premiums have become a financial struggle or other needs have grown more pressing.

At that point, most policyholders just stop paying premiums. They take the modest cash value, if there is any; if it’s a term life policy, there is no cash value. In any event, the insurer never pays a death benefit, an advantage the insurance industry has come to rely on.

“Insurance companies make money when people give up their policies,” said Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has written about life settlement. “Now the life-settlement guys are coming in and offering better deals.”

Why sell a policy for a fraction of what it would bring your heirs? One Texan who sold his policy to Abacus took his family on an around-the-world cruise, Mr. Jackson said. But most use life settlements not for luxuries or fantasies, but for medical treatment or living expenses.

How much a policy will fetch depends on its face value and premiums (settlement companies buy whole life, universal life, term insurance or hybrids), as well as on your life expectancy. That explains Mr. Jackson’s questions about my health.

The industry calls this “reverse underwriting.” When you buy life insurance, companies offer a better deal if you’re young and healthy. To get an attractive price when you want to unload that policy years later, it helps to be old and sick.

Life-settlement companies and their investors don’t want to hold onto your policy, paying the premiums, for more than seven to 10 years. “The longer your life expectancy, the lower your offer,” Ms. Horowitz said.

But if your policy looks profitable, a life settlement typically amounts to 20 to 30 percent of its death benefit. That may represent a better deal than simply surrendering a policy, but it isn’t necessarily smarter than keeping it in force.

If you need money immediately and have a policy with cash value, you can borrow against it. If high premiums have become problematic, your beneficiaries might want to take over the payments to receive the face value upon your death.

Moreover, while a death benefit flows to your beneficiaries tax-free, life-settlement proceeds are taxable, to the extent they exceed what you have paid in premiums. And owning or selling the policy could stall or complicate the process of qualifying for Medicaid.

Then there’s the question of how much a broker, who submits your information to several life-settlement companies, will take in commission — generally 20 to 30 percent of the price a company offers.

You could avoid that by approaching several settlement companies directly, going through interviews, supplying documentation and then comparing offers. But some policyholders will appreciate having someone shepherd them through the process, especially given the industry’s somewhat dodgy past.

Sellers found it hard to ascertain whether they were receiving a fair price, for instance, and how much of it a broker was pocketing, the federal Government Accountability Office reported in 2010.

In response, 43 states have adopted life-settlement regulations, usually requiring that companies be licensed and make consumer disclosures. “The industry cleaned itself up a lot,” Dr. Smetters said. “But caution is appropriate.”

State regulations differ, and it still requires legwork and fine-print reading to know how much you’ll walk away with and to determine what’s in your interest.

“You have to really understand the contract you’re signing,” Dr. Smetters said. “If I were doing this, I’d try to find out who the major companies are and call myself. But I’d also sit down with a fee-only financial adviser experienced in this area and do the analytics. Is this a good deal?”

So, caution advised. But simply walking away, surrendering a policy you’ve already paid a lot for, rarely represents the best option.

“If my policy is worth $100,000 the day I die, is it worth nothing the day before?” said Darwin Bayston, chief executive of the Life Insurance Settlement Association, a trade group. “The answer is no.”

After Mr. Jackson and I finished the interview, he cheerfully informed me, “There’s almost no probability we’d buy your policy.” My life expectancy, according to Abacus models, is another 280 months, or 23-plus years.

No life-settlement provider or investor wants to hold onto a policy and pay premiums for that long before seeing a payoff.

The premiums on my whole-life policy are low and won’t increase. So I’ll keep writing semiannual checks for now, hoping my family will pocket the death benefit.

Still, scary news from an oncologist or simply the passage of time could upend that plan.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

I have news for those solvers: Today’s puzzle is not that hard, which, of course, is a totally subjective call. I didn’t find it hard. But I’ve also been solving every single day for a very long time. Maybe I’m just on the wavelength of the constructor, Peter Wentz. But it’s easy to make this puzzle fall. Sorry. Maybe Saturday will be harder.

In Halloween-season viewing prospects, there’s good news and less-good news. The good news is that two stellar restorations of stone-cold horror classics were released recently. They are the amazing, amusing “The Old Dark House,” a 1932 horror comedy directed by James Whale, the maestro of “Frankenstein” and “Bride of Frankenstein,” and George A. Romero’s seminal 1968 “Night of the Living Dead,” which had a long road to a beautiful new version.

The less-good news is that these restorations are not yet available for streaming, but are likely to show up in time. The “Living Dead” restoration is distributed by Janus, whose stuff is regularly featured on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck and Kanopy. (In the meantime, if they show up at a theater near you, I implore you to go.)

Filmstruck is actually an excellent site for vintage horror this Halloween. Earlier this month the service featured premieres of six 1940s horror movies produced by Val Lewton for RKO Pictures. Lewton was a novelist-turned-producer of first-class taste, wide-ranging imagination and remarkable resourcefulness. In emphasizing that taste, critics have risked giving his nine RKO horror movies short shrift in terms of their potency in the fright department.

While some Lewton pictures are more conventionally “thrilling” than others — “The Curse of the Cat People” (1944) is an unusual kind of sequel and features a tone more poetic than spooky — most of the movies still carry strong scares. In the original “Cat People” (1942), the European immigrant Irena (Simone Simon), bride of a Norman-Rockwell-type all-American (Kent Smith) fears that her sexual awakening will turn her into a deadly feline creature. The scenes of Irena’s romantic rival Alice (Jane Randolph) seemingly stalked by a panther through Central Park and at an athletic club are still among the tensest ever executed in film.

Similarly, the director Jacques Tourneur, who was behind “Cat People” and “I Walked With a Zombie” (1943) gets an enormous amount of scare-mileage out of the sound of dripping water, a train going over a bridge and, finally, a bolted door and some terrifying sound effects in a stage-setting scene from “The Leopard Man” (1943). “Cat People,” “Zombie,” “Curse” and “Leopard Man” are all part of the Filmstruck package. The other two titles are “The Body Snatcher” (1945) and “Bedlam” (1946), both more horror-conventional in subject matter and star power. “The Body Snatcher” is derived from the Robert Louis Stevenson story and stars both Boris Karloff of “Frankenstein” and Bela Lugosi of “Dracula” fame — it’s one of only six movies the horror heavyweights made together. A spectacularly ghoulish story of grave robbers and medical demonstrations in 19th-century Edinburgh, it builds to a dizzying pitch of delirium. So does “Bedlam,” also starring Karloff, another grim period piece set in an asylum. Because the Lewton productions were low-budget pictures meant to fill out double-features, they’re pretty concise, with not many reaching the 90-minute mark. As such, the lot can serve as terrific Halloween binge-watching.",Streaming Halloween: Canon Classics and New Movies to Scream With,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/movies/streaming-halloween-canon-classics-and-new-movies-to-scream-with.html

SPECIAL POST — We’ve done a lot of celebrating this year, because 75 years of New York Times crossword puzzles — and we’re still going strong — is quite a lot to celebrate. One of the bright lights in this celebration has been the series of crosswords made by celebrity and veteran constructor teams, paired up by crosswords editor Will Shortz.

All of the celebrities that created puzzles for The New York Times were avid solvers, but none had undertaken the task of constructing a crossword before, except for former president Bill Clinton, who had a slight advantage after making one with constructor Cathy Allis (then Millhauser) for The New York Times Magazine in 2007 (answers to that puzzle are here). Each celebrity expressed surprise at how difficult it was to create a New York Times-worthy crossword, but they all had this in common: they stuck with it and they are now published New York Times Crossword constructors.

This list will be updated as more celebrity crosswords are published.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Men have sometimes been prone to disbelieve victims’ stories, and one of the most distasteful aspects of the Harvey Weinstein scandal was a rush to refocus blame by questioning why female victims didn’t speak up earlier or go to the police. That tendency to victim-shame is precisely why survivors are reluctant to speak up — and let’s remember that culpability lies with perpetrators, not victims.

One of the bravest voices has been Ashley Judd, who broke the ice by speaking up about Weinstein. So I asked Judd how men can help.

“Men being willing to have dialogue with their families and friends, and to disrupt sexist remarks, jokes and behavior, is integral to change,” she said. “Learning to let women speak up, and being open and teachable, is crucial. Imagine if we could simply say, ‘stop’ and ‘no,’ and men stopped? These micro interpersonal interactions hold transformative power.”

One unfortunate consequence of greater scrutiny of these issues is that male bosses are sometimes reluctant to have dinner or drinks with female employees, making it difficult for women to build social relationships with bosses and be promoted. I asked Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor, about this, and she said that the solution is obvious.

“More women in all positions of power,” she said. “And not as tokens.”

I’m sure that some men reading this are rolling their eyes. On Twitter, one person responded to my denunciation of sexual harassment with a snide, “Do you have a penis at all?” Sigh. We men simply have to understand that there is nothing manly about sexual assault.

Look, human relations are complicated, we are sexual creatures and it’s inevitable that there will be fine lines and misunderstandings. But a new ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 54 percent of American women report having received unwanted and inappropriate sexual advances — meaning that this is a huge national problem, and a challenge for us all. Civil rights weren’t just a “black problem,” the Holocaust wasn’t just a “Jewish problem” and sexual harassment and discrimination are more than just a “women’s problem.”

Men sometimes weigh in: As a father of a young daughter, I deplore. … But that sounds as if one cares about women only if one has made one, or as if one thinks of female colleagues as little girls. So let’s switch to this paradigm: As a human being, I want fellow humans treated fairly and decently, not poked with less respect than we would treat a pound of beef at the supermarket.

As he said at one point, putting the blame squarely on his Senate colleagues:

“And what do we, as United States senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we should speak and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to.”

He continued:

“And so, Mr. President, I will not be complicit or silent. I’ve decided that I would be better able to represent the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself of the political consideration that consumed far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles.”

He followed by pointing out that “it is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative” has a “narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party,” which has “given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment.”

First, it is true that Republicans in both the House and Senate have chosen career over country and have subordinated principle to party and power. They see in Trump a chance for a transactional relationship, each getting a bit of what they want, even though they know full well that Trump is unstable and unfit for the presidency.

Indeed, I’m growing increasingly angry with Republican lawmakers expressing grave concerns about Trump in private and on background, but biting their tongues in public.

It is no coincidence that the Republican legislators in Washington who have been most critical of Trump — Flake, Bob Corker and John McCain — are those who are definitely not seeking another term, or are unlikely to do so. Even George W. Bush criticized Trump (without saying his name), but he too has nothing to lose electorally.

Where are the real heroes, those with skin in the game and planning to keep it there? Where is the true courage? Well, not in the Republican Party. Political heroism and displays of principled valor have been banished from its ranks. In their stead stand the craven and the corrupt.

It is understandable for Trump to assume Republican senators adore him if, in public, they shower him with adoration. Three times, Trump has referred to getting a standing ovation at a lunch he had Tuesday with Republican senators.

When you bend to lick a boot you relinquish the posture required to stand and tell the truth.

But what is even more disturbing is the slide of the Republican Party toward a presiding sentiment of the “anger and resentment” Flake described. Make no mistake, Flake is no moderate simply because he opposes Trump as a person. He rarely opposes him legislatively.

What has happened is that the ground keeps lurching more rightward beneath Flake’s feet, toward fundamentalism and fanaticism. Indeed, Flake was a Tea Party darling who got scalped by Steve Bannon-ism.

Trump-era Republicans have accepted depravity and vitriol as the price they’re willing to pay to have a person willing to fight the people and institutions they distrust and detest. Encouraging violence isn’t disqualifying. Defaming Mexicans and Muslims is not disqualifying. Bragging about sexual assault is not disqualifying. Being a pathological liar is not disqualifying. Coddling white supremacists is not disqualifying. Attacking Gold Star families is not disqualifying.

None of it is disqualifying. To the contrary, it is supremely satisfying. the Moral Majority has become the iniquitous minority.

This Republican Party is the party of Trump and Bannon, not Flake and Corker.

As Corker correctly said of Trump on CNN:

“He purposely is breaking down relationships we have around the world that have been useful to our nation, but I think at the end of the day, when his term is over, I think the debasing of our nation, the constant non-truth-telling, the name calling … the debasement of our nation will be what he will be remembered most for, and that’s regretful.”",The Menace of Trumpism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/menace-trumpism-flake-republicans.html

You’d be surprised how often identity theft comes down to misplaced or stolen documents. A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.

The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.

Tools to Keep Those Cables Under Control

Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They’re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.

Wirecutter’s favorites — and mine — are Velcro One Wrap Thin Ties. A pack of 100 is only $10, and you can reuse them over and over.

And while you’re getting all of those cables in order, also think about picking up an extra laptop charger and charging cable. The last thing you want is to get home, open your laptop to work and realize you forgot your charger at the office or in another room.

A Quality USB Headset

Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don’t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you’ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.

Wirecutter likes the Jabra UC Voice 550 Duo, which is light enough to wear for long periods, and also offers superior voice and sound quality. It’s also easy to set up: Just plug it in to your computer and it’s ready to use.

A Lap Desk, for Those Couch Working Sessions

I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that working from home sometimes means working in bed or working from the couch in front of the TV. (Call it an office perk.)

When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn’t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.

They outlined Mr. Trump’s announcement on condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting his formal speech.

The president in August called the opioid crisis a “national emergency.” But he did not sign a formal declaration designating it as such, allowing the prospect to languish amid resistance in his administration about making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with a crisis that has shown no signs of abating. The crisis has claimed tens of thousands of lives — a death rate that one administration official noted Thursday rivals the number of Americans killed during the Vietnam War.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is not clear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out, including a drug czar to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of Health and Human Services who would tailor policies and identify funding streams.

Representative Tom Marino, the Pennsylvania Republican whom Mr. Trump had named to head his Office of National Drug Control Policy, withdrew last week after reports that he did the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in weakening law enforcement’s ability to curb drug sales in efforts to block black-market sales of opioids. The White House has yet to announce a new candidate.

And Tom Price resigned last month as health secretary after it was revealed he was flying on private jets paid for with taxpayer dollars; a nominee has not been named for that post either.

But proponents, including some anti-addiction groups and physicians, argue Mr. Trump’s action is an important symbolic step that would raise awareness and spark a new sense of urgency to deal with the opioid scourge.

The administration officials said a public health emergency declaration would quickly lead to crucial changes, including the potential to secure federal grant money and the expansion of access to telemedicine services, which would broaden the reach of medical treatment to rural areas ravaged by opioid use and where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump’s promises to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year.

As president, he formed an opioid commission in March and installed at the helm Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race. In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have prompted the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump has chosen.

Mr. Price had ruled out the idea of a national emergency, in part because of concerns about the potentially exorbitant costs to the federal government. Still, Mr. Trump surprised his advisers by telling reporters soon after his commission’s report that he was ready to take just such a step.

There have been few major actions to match those words, even as administration officials have worked feverishly behind the scenes to come to agreement on an opioid policy that would reflect the president’s position.

In the meantime, members of Mr. Trump’s opioid commission and lawmakers in both parties had grown impatient for action. On Wednesday, a group of Democrats led by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan released a letter they wrote to the president asking him to allow the government to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Declaring a state of emergency would give the secretary of Health and Human Services the power to seek such price reductions, they said.

Mr. Christie commended the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.",Trump to Declare Opioid Crisis a ‘Public Health Emergency’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

The books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

The Dinner That Fueled the Civil Rights Freedom Fighters

By Bee Wilson

Like any good soup, a bowl of Louisiana gumbo can uplift you even when there is nothing to feel uplifted about. On Sept. 17, 1960, a group of students in New Orleans, three black and one white, sat down at McCrory’s whites-only lunch counter and refused to leave until they were served. The students were convicted of criminal mischief, though that would be overturned by the Supreme Court in Lombard v. Louisiana (1963), a key moment in the fight against segregation. But before this historic meal came another: The sit-in was organized few days earlier over spicy gumbo at Dooky Chase’s Restaurant.

Gumbo makes people braver; it satisfies the soul and gets you talking, says Leah Chase, the legendary African-American chef of Creole cuisine, who is still cooking at 94. “Honey, this is where they planned the thing,” she says over the phone from New Orleans, her voice warm and musical. She remembers the young activists who belonged to CORE — the Congress of Racial Equality — eating a series of lunches and dinners that September in her restaurant’s upstairs room.

The leader was Rudy Lombard, 21, a fiery orator. Also there were Cecil Carter Jr., another black student; Lanny Goldfinch, a white student; and Oretha Castle, a courageous black human rights campaigner whose mother, Vergie, was the bartender at Dooky Chase. It was illegal at that time in the South for blacks and whites to eat in the same restaurant, but this danger didn’t deter the CORE students, who often spoke of sacrificing their lives for the cause. They shared seafood gumbo thickened with filé powder (ground dried sassafras leaves), fried chicken and Lombard’s favorite Italian salad of salami, capers and olives, with Lolis Edward Elie, a local lawyer. Over the food there were intense discussions about what they could and couldn’t do to advance their cause within the law. The activists toasted their plans with glasses of Barq’s root beer. According to Chase, “When they were working, they didn’t drink so much as a bottle of beer.”

In 1960, Dooky Chase was one of the very few dining places in New Orleans where black people could eat with heavy cutlery on pressed linen tablecloths. Growing up, Lombard once told a radio interviewer, he dreamed of eating somewhere like that. His mother worked as a cook for a rich family, and she worked across the street from a fancy restaurant called Pascal’s Manale. As a boy, Rudy longed to eat there. Chase gave him and the other CORE members a taste of that restaurant ease. He once said he saw the restaurant as “an incubator of black people’s aspirations.”

Another activist who regularly ate there was Raphael Cassimere Jr., an emeritus history professor at the University of New Orleans. Cassimere remembers meetings of the N.A.A.C.P., whose office was a few blocks away, where people got “all steamed up,” but as soon as everyone was sitting down with Chase’s gumbo, “you’d be laughing again.” This gumbo was like the food of Louisiana grandmothers, Cassimere recalls, except that “you could get it 24 hours. And it was cheap.” Sometimes, in an extra-generous mood, Chase didn’t charge at all. She fed many of the Freedom Riders, who took a series of perilous bus trips through the South in 1961, trying to use whites-only restrooms and restaurants along the way.

Sometimes the activists arrived at the restaurant dirty, right out of jail. “Poor darlings,” she says. “I used to feel so sorry for them.” Chase sent them around the corner to Vergie’s home to take a bath. And then she fed them.

The Dinner That Dashed Presidential Hopes

By Brenda Wineapple

In 1884, James Gillespie Blaine, a Republican senator from Maine, ate a dinner that helped him lose the presidency. Blaine is now nearly forgotten, but during the Gilded Age he was a star candidate for the White House from 1876 to 1892, even when he didn’t want the job — and despite the pungent whiff of financial scandal always trailing him. “Blaine, Blaine, the continental liar from the State of Maine,” opponents taunted him, while die-hard “Blainiacs” called him a gallant “plumed knight.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Whatever Blaine was, he had also been a speaker of the House, a secretary of state and a man who liked to eat. It was, after all, the period of the so-called Great Barbecue, when politicians and financiers and railroad buccaneers all splurged together, whether on the public trust or on oysters and Champagne. On Oct. 29, just one week before Election Day, when Blaine was poised to beat his Democratic opponent, Grover Cleveland, he accepted an invitation to a dinner in his honor at Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City. Since 1837, the wealthy and the notable had eaten there: Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon III, Jenny Lind and even Charles Dickens, who despised American cuisine. Delmonico’s seemed to rebut single-handedly the notion that American cooking, as one historian put it, insulted every sense but hearing.

The Delmonico family knew all about farm-to-table; they had bought over 200 acres in Brooklyn to grow fresh fruits and vegetables. (Regardless, the restaurant’s bill of fare was resoundingly French. Even the menu was written in it.) The name “Delmonico” came to symbolize luxury — and excess. At one particularly extravagant banquet, each woman discovered a gold bracelet folded in her napkin. And at the James Blaine dinner, while a full orchestra played patriotic tunes, the 200 guests were seated at huge tables covered with white cloths, tropical ferns and confections representing their occupations. On Blaine’s table was a model White House, apparently made of sugar.

Blaine never made it to the real White House. The day after his banquet, The Associated Press printed the elaborate menu, along with the guest list, which included the nation’s richest men, millionaires like Andrew Carnegie, John Jacob Astor and Jay Gould, who could afford a nine-course meal and, by implication, a nine-course president. They supped on “consommé à la Victoria” or “crème de volaille à la Berchoux” before choosing “kingfish à la Richelieu” or fried smelts for their fish course. For the course known as the “relevés,” they tucked into “selle de chevreuil à la Tyrolienne” (roast saddle of young venison surrounded by tartlets of sour-apple marmalade covered in puff pastry) or “filet de boeuf à la Clarendon.” Entrees followed: “ailes de volaille à la Lucullus” (chicken breast garnished with truffles and balls of foie gras), “ris de veau au chancelier” (sweetbreads in sauce) or “terrapène à la Maryland” (turtle stew). Not to be forgotten were side dishes like pommes à l’Anglaise (English boiled potatoes) and the roast course of canvasback duck. Desserts included prunelle jelly and chestnut soufflé, all attended by the appropriate wine. After dinner, the men were seen staggering to their carriages.

News of the dinner spread when another millionaire, Joseph Pulitzer, a Democrat, ran a front-page cartoon in his paper, The New York World. Titled “The Royal Feast of Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings,” it depicted a gaggle of portly plutocrats dining on “lobby pudding” and “patronage cake,” while a working family, at the foot of the table, held out a hand for scraps. In the background was a biblical inscription that referred to the handwriting on the wall. Cleveland supporters plastered posters of the cartoon on walls all over the state.

James Blaine lost New York by about only 1,000 votes, but that meant he failed to receive the crucial electoral votes he needed for the White House. And he never got any nearer to it — not as president anyway. But there are second acts in American life: After a long and conspicuous trip to Scotland with Andrew Carnegie, Blaine decided to throw his support in 1888 to Benjamin Harrison, who, once elected, made Blaine secretary of state again. By the next election, in 1892, Blaine’s appetite for presidential politics had dwindled, his gout had increased, and he quietly left the banquet.",The Dinners That Shaped History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/magazine/the-dinners-that-shaped-history.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Most designer coffee-table books are, to be honest, really just glossy accessories to egos and living rooms. This one may well be something different: once again a lightning rod for debate, and possibly censure, given the current conversation. Certainly it will raise questions that should be raised. Especially since, at 74, Mr. Klein, who has been busy building houses and designing uniforms for the Harlem Village Academies, is ready to think about many of them — if not to completely address the implications.

Why did you decide to finally publish a book?

People had suggested it for many years. Mrs. Onassis was the first one who asked me. God knows why. Anna Wintour had been pushing me to do it for a long time. But I don’t like looking back; I like to be in the moment, and think about the future. Plus I thought it might be emotional, and I didn’t want to go there. But I do a lot of speaking to students, and I realized they knew my name, but they certainly had no idea of the imagery we used. And I wanted them to be able to learn from that.

Do you think people will be suspicious of that imagery, given the current groundswell of discussion on women being put in uncomfortable situations?

I never thought publication would coincide with this conversation, though I also think it’s about time we had this conversation. But all of these images came from my life in one way or another, especially my life with Kelly [his former wife]. It was really a reflection of what was happening. The 1970s were a pretty crazy time in New York. There was Berlin in the 1920s, and Paris in the 1930s, and New York in the 1970s. The orgy campaign started with me thinking about Studio 54. People ask me if it was really like that. Probably, yeah.

The culture of the 1970s was one of the justifications Harvey Weinstein used for his behavior.

But what is happening in the culture does not give anyone the right to act in an abusive way. In terms of Harvey, not everyone did what he did in the 1970s and after. That’s not about culture; it’s about character. He used his position to take advantage of women right from the beginning.

Did you deliberately set out to be provocative?

When I was thinking about our campaign for our first fragrance, I was looking at the competition and they always had these young, pretty girls running through a field of wheat. And I just thought: “Is that why women buy fragrance? Because they want to run through wheat?” No. They buy it because they want to attract men, or they want to be attractive to themselves. So I always put men and women together. Is that being provocative? That is being realistic.

Photo

In those days I would look at Vogue, and it was thick with hundreds of pages, and I wanted my company to stand out. So I did six-, eight-page spreads — once I did a 27-page outsert. They weren’t always about sex, but they often went in that direction because that’s me. That’s who I am. I did what I did, and I put it out there for students.

How did you choose the images?

I picked the images the same way I always did: what got my heart racing. No matter which photographer was doing the shoot, we would discuss what we were trying to say, where we would shoot, who the model would be. In the early days, I would be on shoots, styling. Then I would edit the film at night. We always pushed to be more creative and exciting, and sometimes we went over the top. Sometimes we pushed the envelope too far. I understand that.

There was a shoot that got referred to as kiddie porn, for example. It was for jeans, photographed in what looked like a basement with knobby pine paneling and shag carpeting. We thought it was funny and provocative, but the Justice Department did not. They investigated us.

But it was during a year when everyone was talking about family values, and Bill Clinton, who was president, stood up and said he didn’t approve of the Calvin Klein ads. I ended up pulling the campaign and taking out a page advertisement in The New York Times trying to apologize. Steven Meisel shot it, and to this day he can’t get over the attacks. For me, it came with the territory.

You were used to it by then?

My feeling was: If you start to think about what everyone else might think before you design something or put an image out there, you’ll never get anything done. I built my company with my childhood friend — just like Donna Karan did and Ralph Lauren did — and we built it based on creativity, with the assumption that if people wanted what we created, it would be profitable.

That’s how we ended up working with Kate. I went to Paris to see how other designers did shows — I went to Chanel and a few others — and I saw all these women whom I had thought were really special, and they were in every show. So then I started to think: That’s not really so special. It was a period when lots of models were enhancing their breasts and doing crazy things to their bodies, and I found it pretty offensive. So I came back from Paris and thought: I have to do something different.

After a while Patrick Demarchelier called and said he thought he’d found someone like we’d been looking for, and he sent Kate over. She had some personal photographs that Mario Sorrenti, her boyfriend at the time, had taken of her. He wasn’t even a professional photographer then. So I asked to meet Mario, and then I gave him a camera and sent them off to an island together.

Did any of the reactions make you rethink your decisions?

The strangest reaction we ever got, to me, was for a children’s underwear shoot. Rosie O’Donnell denounced me on her TV show. She said, “I’ll never buy anything from Calvin Klein again.” I understand now that, at that time, everything I did was assumed to have an ulterior motive.

We tried to be sensitive. One time we did an underwear shoot with Christy Turlington, who was always very careful about how she was photographed and what was revealed. And the pictures were revealing. But they were not obscene. Anyway, we gave her all the negatives afterward, so they could never be used again.

Why did you stop?

I left because I thought I’d done everything creatively I wanted to do. I didn’t want to expand into areas that didn’t feel natural, and I didn’t want to design the same thing for the rest of my life. I had design studios for every collection, and I was there for the beginning and middle and end, and there’d be young people sketching and they would show me what they’d drawn, and I would say, “But we did this already.” And they’d say, “No, it’s new.” And I’d say, “But I remember it.” And I just thought, “If I don’t do it now, when?” I wanted to live a different way.

Now large corporations have gobbled up designers, and they stay two years and then move on. I think that’s unfortunate.

For the experiment, the scientists injected a modified rabies vaccine into the animals, where it entered the nervous system and brain. They then tracked and labeled connections between brain cells and learned that compared to the sedentary animals’ brain cells, the runners’ newborn neurons had more and longer dendrites, the snaky tendrils that help to connect the cells into the neural communications network. They also found that more of these connections led to portions of the brain that are important for spatial memory, which is our internal map of where we have been and how we got there.

This type of memory is often diminished in the early stages of dementia.

But these findings, while intriguing, involved animals that had been running for a month, which is the equivalent of years of physical activity by people. The researchers wondered whether such changes in neurons and connections might actually begin earlier and maybe almost immediately after the animals began to exercise.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Scientific Reports, most of the same researchers gathered a group of adult, male mice. (Males were used to avoid accounting for the effects of the female reproductive cycle.) The animals were injected with a substance that marks newborn neurons. Half were then allowed to run for a week on wheels in their cages, while the others remained inactive. Afterward, some were also injected with the modified rabies vaccine to track new synapses and connections between the neurons.

When the scientists then microscopically examined brain tissue, they found that the runners’ brains, as expected, teemed with far more new neurons than did the brains of the sedentary animals, even though the runners had been exercising for only a week.

Interestingly, these neurons also looked unique. They were larger and, as in the study of mice that ran for a month, displayed more and longer dendrites than similar neurons in the other animals. In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.

These young cells were better integrated into the overall brain circuitry, too, with more connections into portions of the brain involved in spatial and other types of memory. Most surprising to the scientists, these cells also proved to be less easily activated by neurochemical messages to fire rapidly, which is usually a hallmark of more mature neurons. They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.

What these differences in cell structure and connection mean for brain function remains uncertain, though, says Henriette van Praag, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health and senior author of this and the earlier study. Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.

But the current study “provides more pieces of evidence that brain cells produced under running conditions are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different” than other neurons, she says, “and these differences are evident very soon” after exercise begins.

Perhaps most important, the new brain cells in the runners tended to integrate into and bulk up portions of the brain that, if damaged by disease, are associated with early memory loss and dementia, she adds.

Of course, this experiment used mice, which are not people. While some past neurological studies with people have hinted that exercise might alter our brain structure in similar ways, she says, that possibility is still theoretical.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Among individual solvers, Japan’s Ken Endo was first, scoring 7,655 points, far ahead of Germany’s Ulrich Voigt (previous 11-time W.P.C. champion), in second place, with 6,782; and Kota Morinishi, also of Japan, in third, with 6,724. Each puzzle was worth 5 to 250 points depending on difficulty.","Japan Wins World Puzzle Championship, U.S.A.

This, she says, is why some Asian immigrant parents view their children’s future through such narrow lenses.","The GPS staff includes Ivy League alumni and full-time high school teachers; some tutors are both. Yan himself grew up in Flushing, attending the selective Da Vinci Science and Math Institute for high school. As an adult, he worked as a financial analyst until 2011, when, feeling a lack of purpose on Wall Street, he turned to the test-prep industry. “I felt like I was just part of the process,” Yan says about his former career. “But now I feel very proud when my kids get into a top school or get a very high SAT score. I see the results right away, and I feel more in control.” He floods local Chinese radio stations and newspapers with ads for GPS, but he estimates that a majority of his customers arrive through simple word of mouth. “Basically,” he says, “one person gets into Stuyvesant — all his relatives and friends ask where he went for prep.”

It was in a GPS Academy class for the city high-school test, three years ago, that Join Wang first met most of his close friends. That group, now juniors at Stuyvesant and Bronx Science, regrouped again this summer for SAT classes. “It’s kind of become a joke: ‘What are you going to do in the summer?’ ‘Go to prep,’” Wang says. “We all go to prep.”

Wang’s parents came to the United States from Fujian, China. He says it’s difficult to get them to open up about their past, but he knows his mother came from an affluent family of winemakers, while his dad grew up in the countryside. They started fresh here, teaching themselves English and saving money to help family members follow; now they run a laundromat business in Elmhurst, Queens. This summer, Wang and his two younger brothers shared a room with one bunk bed, taking turns sleeping on the floor’s bamboo mat. His parents were in the other bedroom, with his sister and youngest brother. If test-prep classes were ever a financial burden for them, they never showed it, brushing off Wang’s questions, he says, telling him: “You’re just a little kid. Calm down, and leave the finances to us.”

Yan says many of his customers struggle financially but will still pay thousands if it helps ensure that their children can get into a prestigious high school, which will, presumably, lead to a prestigious college. “It’s more like a culture thing, you know?” he says. “They would rather not get expensive sneakers, but they will try to put their kids in a very expensive prep school.”

Traces of the Asian tutoring industry have emerged in the United States after each wave of immigration from countries like China and South Korea, says Pyong Gap Min, a sociology professor at Queens College in the City University of New York. They began in the 1960s, Min says, after the repeal of longstanding exclusionary immigration laws — but it was in the 1980s that cities like New York first saw a notable presence of supplemental educational centers, following a swell of migration from China, Korea and South Asia. Min considers the test-prep centers of Flushing offshoots of their origin countries’ rigorous “cram schools,” called bǔ xí bān in China and hagwon in South Korea. This rigor is seen as necessary to keep up with national test-based systems like China’s, where a single exam determines university placement. “It’s Confucian to emphasize your children’s education,” Min says. “You go to China, Korea and Taiwan, there’s after-school programs that they transplanted here.”

The preparation certainly pays off; Asian students from varying backgrounds are now a majority in New York’s most competitive public schools. Stuyvesant is three-quarters Asian, and Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech’s shares are over 60 percent. This has come with its share of controversy; a federal complaint, filed by a coalition of advocacy groups in 2012, argued that the high-stakes, single-exam admissions process has a discriminatory impact on black and Latino children (who may find fewer resources and opportunities to prepare for it), and should consider a wider set of factors, like previous grades, interviews or teacher recommendations. (The Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights announced that it would open an investigation, though the current status of that investigation is unclear. Only the New York State Legislature — not New York City itself — can change the admissions policy for the schools.)

But David Lee — a Brooklyn Technical High School class of 1978 alumnus — argues that students at the three most competitive specialized schools are not necessarily economically privileged: About 40 to 60 percent of them qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. Lee is a leader of Coalition Edu, a group that defends the test-based admissions policy, joining a chorus of former students who say cultural values and an exceptional work ethic have pushed Asians of all income groups to excel in the specialized high school system.

Jennifer Lee, a professor of sociology at Columbia University, says such perceptions of Asian exceptionalism percolate in both liberal and conservative circles, with conservatives using Asian success as a main point in arguing against affirmative-action policies. But that shouldn’t suggest, she says, that other minorities don’t value hard work or education. She argues in “The Asian American Achievement Paradox,” her 2015 book with Min Zhou, that much of Asian-Americans’ educational attainment actually stems from a hyperselective immigration policy: A 2015 census report found that a majority of Chinese immigrants have college degrees, a distinction matched by fewer than one-third of Americans as a whole and only 16 percent of the population in China itself.

The fortunes of educated Asian immigrants become what’s known as “ethnic capital,” a stock of knowledge and resources that can trickle down — through networks ranging from test-prep centers to religious institutions to ordinary family and social connections in immigrant enclaves — and benefit less established families as well. According to David Lee, demand for supplemental classes is higher for Asian immigrant families that are not as wealthy: “They’re hungrier,” he says. “They need to have this as a steppingstone.” And since they’re often utterly unfamiliar with the American college-admissions process, having obtained degrees overseas or not at all, test-prep schools can be an essential tool. “So working-class families sacrifice what they have,” he says.

Join Wang still remembers the pressure of the city test in eighth grade, which had everyone competing for admission to Stuyvesant. He felt nervous during the beginning and the end of the exam and believes he was too careless in the middle. Rushing through without checking his work is, he says, “a pretty big problem for me.” Early the next year, when scores were revealed, his middle-school Spanish class became a flurry of children opening letters and discovering their test scores. Wang read “551” on his own letter — just a few points short, he’d later learn, of a score that could have won him a place at Stuyvesant. He was able to hold his tears back until a classmate noticed his downcast face and offered a hug. He politely declined. That’s when the sobs came. “It was kind of like anarchy,” he recalls. “They made sure to give it to us the last class in case this happened.”

The conversation with his parents that night seemed anticlimactic in comparison. “I got into Bronx Science,” he said, as if confessing to a small disobedience. “Oh, it’s not the end of the world,” his dad responded. But Wang couldn’t help feeling disappointed. “You know, they’re my parents,” he says. “I don’t want to make them sad or anything.”

Wang has never thought of his mother and father as “tiger parents,” that stereotype of the cold, disapproving Asian parents who demand success, on threat of denouncing their child as a dishonor to the family. Wang’s parents, he says, just want him to be happy. “But my dad also wants me to get into Harvard, just like every other Asian dad!” he says with a laugh.

His comments reflect the unspoken contract that the children of immigrants often perceive: Because our parents sacrificed so much for us, we will always be in their debt. Those expectations weighed heavily over my own hometown, Cupertino, Calif., an affluent suburb full of Asian immigrants working high-skill STEM jobs in Silicon Valley. Local parents poured exorbitant shares of their income into mortgages to secure their children spots in public schools regularly ranked among the nation’s best — and then poured even more into supplementary tutoring classes, music lessons, sports leagues and more.

I did not quite express the same gratitude for this as Wang does. I spent my time fuming over being born into a hypercompetitive bubble and missing out on the “true” high school experience. When the time came for summer SAT classes, I made a point of not paying attention or finishing the homework packets, out of sheer annoyance with my parents. I wished I could just live a “normal” life. But as soon as I escaped the Bay Area and moved to the Midwest, I saw that being normal was never entirely possible for me, whether socially or professionally. “The Asian American Achievement Paradox” touches on this, too: Despite supposedly positive stereotypes of Asians, we still face what Lee calls a “bamboo ceiling,” keeping us from leadership positions and from recognition in more subjective career fields — which tend not to favor a demographic that lacks networking connections and has long been imagined to be uncreative or submissive. This, she says, is why some Asian immigrant parents view their children’s future through such narrow lenses. “In order for their kids to succeed as minorities,” she says, “having the right credentials, scoring well and getting into a top school can achieve mobility in a field where you might be less likely to experience discrimination.”

There’s also the concept Lee calls “parental bragging rights.” When immigrants move to the United States, she points out, they often experience a drop in status — socially, professionally and legally. Some will never regain that stature, settling over the long term for more menial jobs. But they may attempt to recoup some standing through their children’s success. Chris Kwok, a 1992 Stuyvesant graduate who knows Wang from church, grew up in a working-class family in Flushing; in China, his father had been an engineer, but in Queens, he worked as a blue-collar city contractor, and Kwok’s mother was employed in a garment factory. For his first summer prep class, Kwok recalls: “I made no decision. It was just, ‘This is what you’re doing.’”

The programs he attended in the late 1980s, he remembers, were “terrible,” but at least half his classmates got into either Stuyvesant or Bronx Science, in part because the classes forced a certain kind of discipline. “My parents spent money that they earned,” he says. “The message is that you’re supposed to be paying attention to studying. If you didn’t, you know, you just felt guilty.”

Now that Wang is halfway through high school, he wonders at times where he will go from there. He admits that he would like to leave New York and try being independent for a while. But, he says, “my No. 1 priority is making my parents happy, because they have done so much for me. After that is what I like.”

On a recent Saturday, Wang was logging in to check his SAT results at a Thai cafe near his house, tapping at the screen as if playing some mobile game. “Oh!” he exclaimed, breaking into a sly smile at the score that emerged. “Checking my answers was so worth it.”

Was he going to celebrate? Wang wasn’t sure; it might be premature. His parents had already started him on private college counseling. He would have plenty of time to relax and pursue hobbies later, he said — once he had a solid job.

Mr. Puigdemont leads a fragile coalition of separatist parties that control 72 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament.

Last Saturday, Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister of Spain, announced that, using Article 155, he was preparing to take full control over Catalonia’s administration and to replace Mr. Puigdemont, along with Catalonia’s entire separatist leadership, in order to stop the region’s secessionism in its tracks.

The mounting pressures on both men were evident throughout a day of confusion in a crisis that has presented Spain with one of its gravest tests since embracing democracy in 1978.

Mr. Puigdemont clearly hoped that a pre-emptive call for elections would hold off Madrid’s intervention. Earlier on Thursday, the separatist leader scheduled, delayed and then finally canceled a televised address in which he had been expected to take such a move.

His delay was apparently designed to secure a firm pledge from Mr. Rajoy that Madrid would not impose the emergency measures, in return for Mr. Puigdemont’s calling off a unilateral declaration of independence.

But in the time leading up to Mr. Puigdemont’s scheduled lunchtime news conference, with no guarantee forthcoming and word leaking out of his expected move, separatists started gathering outside the Catalan government building to protest the prospect of a U-turn.

Without a guarantee from Madrid, Mr. Puigdemont faced instead broadening descent in his own ranks, with some members of his conservative party announcing that they would quit if the Catalan leaders opted for new elections rather than secession.

That raised the prospect of an internal revolt that could tear apart Mr. Puigdemont’s independence movement.

For more than two weeks, Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy had engaged in a game of chicken over whether the Catalan leader was ready to secede unilaterally, following a confusing address to the Catalan Parliament on Oct. 10 in which Mr. Puigdemont appeared to declare independence — only to suspend it a moment later.

The pressures on both leaders have by now become formidable. Mr. Puigdemont risks decades in prison for rebellion should he push ahead with his secessionist plan.

In Madrid, Mr. Rajoy has been under severe pressure from hard-liners in his conservative party not to relent in the effort to snuff out the Catalan rebellion.

Last week, Mr. Puigdemont warned in a letter to Mr. Rajoy that Catalan lawmakers would vote for a declaration of independence if Mr. Rajoy imposed direct rule on their region.

Mr. Rajoy’s call for Article 155 measures — never used before — would allow him to to impose direct rule and to take control of the autonomous region’s police force and broadcaster.

Even before Mr. Puigdemont’s news conference, some were calling him a traitor.

Gabriel Rufián, a Catalan separatist member of the Spanish Parliament, wrote “155 pieces of silver” in a tweet, a reference to Judas’s payment for betraying Jesus in the Bible.

Mr. Puigdemont’s government has been flouting Spain’s Constitution since early September, when separatist lawmakers voted on legislation to hold a binding referendum on independence on Oct. 1 as a key step toward statehood.

An alliance of separatist parties has controlled the Catalan Parliament since 2015, after winning elections, but with only 48 percent of the votes.

After the October vote, Mr. Puigdemont was under intense pressure to declare independence, since Catalans voted for secession in the highly controversial referendum, which was marred by clashes between the Spanish police and Catalan citizens.

The vote, however, took place without legal guarantees and with most Catalan opponents of independence staying away in protest. The referendum was declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

This month, a judge from Spain’s national court ordered prison without bail for two leaders of the Catalan independence movement, pending a trial for sedition.

Last weekend, Mr. Rajoy insisted that using Article 155 “was neither our desire nor our intention,” but instead the only way to to return Catalonia to legality and normality and to maintain a Spanish economic recovery “which is now under clear danger because of the capricious and unilateral decisions” of the Catalan separatist government.",Catalan Leader Will Let Lawmakers Decide on Independence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/europe/catalonia-spain-carles-puigdemont.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Always helpful to his readers, Grisham lays out the basics simply, including this list: “(1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.”

They’ve gone to a terrible school, and their legal training hasn’t prepped them for much.

Senator Bob Corker, the Republican head of the Foreign Relations Committee, was asked on Tuesday if President Trump was a role model for American children. “Absolutely not,” he replied.

A few hours later, another Republican senator, Jeff Flake, denounced the president.

Congressional Republicans seem to be revolting against Mr. Trump. But is that what is really happening?

And Xi Jinping, the leader of China, is consolidating his power.

On today’s episode:

• Glenn Thrush, a White House correspondent, says that Tuesday was “a day of historic insurrection by the Republican ranks,” but only on its surface.

They might say that they would have made a different choice had they known what we know now about the vulnerability of the teenage brain to cannabis. In the same vein, they could take the opportunity to note how very lucky they were that nothing went wrong, or to explain what did.

Parents sometimes worry that talking about their past use, or talking about illegal substances at all, might be taken as granting permission to experiment with drugs. If this is a concern, it can be addressed head on: “I did try pot, but I don’t want you to hear that as me saying that it’s O.K. for you. I want you to be smarter about it than I was.”

Other adults might welcome the opportunity to articulate the conditions under which they would give their blessing. For instance, the mother of a teenager in my practice said that she wouldn’t mind if her son tried marijuana, but only once he was in college, and only by smoking the supply of an uncle who grows his own. For parents who have no objections to cannabis use, questions about the past can open the door to discussions of what has changed in recent years, such as the growing availability of edible and concentrated forms of marijuana, and what hasn’t: recreational use of it is still illegal for minors in the United States.

Research consistently shows that adolescents take their parents’ guidance to heart even if they don’t always indicate as much. Regardless of the parent’s stance on marijuana use, it might be worth adding, “I’m asking you to be careful because I don’t want you to get hurt or find yourself on a path that you don’t mean to be on.”

The results of the same recent study on direct conversations about drugs suggest that personal or vicarious accounts of the downsides of substance use are especially compelling for teenagers. A parent who has a lot of stories to share might say, “Your grandparents were not paying attention when I was growing up and I got myself into situations that I should have never been in. When I became a parent I knew I wanted to do it differently. Let’s keep talking about this because I did enough learning for both of us.”

Some teenagers who ask about their parents’ past use are actually seeking the opposite of permission to try marijuana. They’re looking for reassurance that it’s O.K. not to. As one of my adolescent clients put it, “You can worry that you’re missing out on something — that it’s part of the ‘high school experience’ that a teenager is supposed to have.”

Mr. Hice addressed this concern by encouraging his son to see if he could have fun without using drugs and to “think about the pitfalls, your health, getting caught, getting expelled.” He also told his son that he watched his fraternity brothers closely both when they were high and also on the next day. From there Mr. Hice explained that, “it just didn’t look like the benefits outweighed the risks.”

Parents won’t always know what’s behind their teenager’s sudden interest in their personal choices and responding with either a detailed confessional or an abrupt, “That’s none of your business,” will probably make it harder to find out.

And adults who aren’t prepared to answer the opening question can still keep the lines of communication open, so long as “I’m not sure I’m ready to have this conversation” gently gives way to “but how come you’re asking?”","When Your Teenager Asks, ‘Did You Smoke Weed?’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/well/family/when-your-teenager-asks-did-you-smoke-weed.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The dinner parties started years ago in an unfinished loft in industrial Brooklyn: chickens cooked in a balky oven and served on a banged-up old table someone found on the street. My wife and I were unmarried then, childless, but already, it seemed, in the process of building a sort of home, the sort we wanted to live in, where there’s always something happening in the kitchen, always a lot of people bustling about and always an extra seat for whoever’s around: friends from college, from work, from the bar. We’d put the call out on a weekend morning: You free for dinner? Then make a salad to go with the meat, roast some potatoes with onions and rosemary, slide a few baguettes onto the table, serve a lot of wine. We did this often enough that the eating became not just simple sustenance but instead a kind of rolling weekly party of six people, eight, 10, informal and slightly disorganized, our room filled with conversation and good cheer. Eventually the calls started coming in rather than going out: You cooking tonight?

Later we cooked in an airy apartment a few miles north, next to a candle factory that filled the air with strange vanilla scents: big feeds of shredded pork or brisket and heaps of steamed greens, as babies slept in their car seats next to their parents’ chairs. We were a family by then, in fact as much as spirit. We moved the babies east, to a tiny old house on the end of Long Island where we would put a dozen or more people around a table for eight to eat epic meals of clams and corn, ribs and rice. Arms got tangled as people who sometimes hardly knew one another reached for the food. Someone put a name to that, to the way you’d have to snake your arm under someone else’s just to get to the butter, the salad, a bottle, the salt: the boardinghouse reach.

Table Talk Go for empathy when you talk politics. Showing how a political issue affects you intimately is more important than data and statistics. Try leading with a personal story.

We took the boardinghouse reach to dinners in Connecticut after that, where we simmered chili and cooked fragrant roast lamb and served it outside on a picnic table under towering oaks after picking up friends at the train. We took it to Maine, where we cooked on a wood stove and ate over a plywood table lighted with kerosene lamps: cod cakes, slaw, chicken paprikash. We reached across tables on sticky urban roofs under the night sky, in suburban yards under string lights, in rooms that were small and dingy, large and luxurious. We cooked for family real and imagined, usually casually, occasionally formally, ideally somewhere between the two. The point was just to cook — or, more accurate, the point was just to get people to gather around a table and eat, and to do so regularly enough that they knew that it would happen again soon.

Is that a proper dinner party, to eat that way? It is when the company’s good and you can have ice-cream sandwiches for dessert. There won’t be coasters for the cocktails, and you’ll need to hold on to your fork between courses — if indeed there are courses. Coats will be piled on a bed or draped over a banister in the hall. You may need to sit on a stool or a box. But there will always be candles set out and hot dogs in the back of the fridge if someone’s kid doesn’t like the mushrooms in the lasagna or the oxtails in the stew. A dinner party to me is just dinner, served to a crowd that can ebb or flood depending on the season or the weather, on whether a call went out or a work schedule changed.

This sort of entertaining requires flexibility in planning. When all are welcome, people bring other people. So you will want to ask your guests to bring beverages and flowers and other markers of good cheer. Asking helps underscore the message of the night: We’re all in this together. (I always ask for dessert.) To that end as well, don’t cook food that’s portioned as single servings — go with things that can easily be spread across more portions than you’d planned, in case someone brings a new girlfriend, some kid’s friends, somebody’s mom or dad. I like tacos for that, huge salads, lots of potatoes.

Table Talk To ensure a guest’s story becomes truly interesting, just ask two questions over and over: what and why. What exactly happened? What did that feel like? Seek emotional specifics. And then: Why? Why is this anecdote important? This is where the guest’s most thoughtful connection to a story lies.

For much the same reason, a dinner party of the sort I enjoy demands a casual approach to setting the table and to setting a time when you’re actually going to eat. You want to edge into the evenings slowly, engaging in a kind of hospitality that encourages repose rather than nervousness that you’re not going to know which fork to use when you eventually sit down. That takes a kind of confidence, the sort you gain only by practice. It requires that you act as a host. Make sure there is music playing, though not so loudly that you can’t hear people talk. Then, as people arrive, make sure they get a glass of wine or a beer or a rather larger cocktail than they’d make for themselves. Introduce the outgoing ones to people they don’t know; lead the shy to their friends or put them to work in the kitchen, peeling vegetables or stirring a pot. And soon enough it happens, right in front of you: Conversation burbles, runs to fishing and novels, to politics and farming, nearly always to real estate, always to laughs. I watch the energy build. It always builds.

And then, when there’s a good, convivial buzz in the air, I call everyone to attention and serve shellfish in the kitchen or out in the yard, steamed clams or shucked oysters or peel-your-own shrimp, meant to be consumed standing up, as if we were animals at a trough, though the sort of animals who drink prosecco with their feed. I do that because it’s delicious and different (we’re not sitting down?) and special, but also because I believe it acts as a kind of dinner bell in the universe, a dog whistle heard by only my knucklehead friends who said they’d be coming at 6 but then got caught up in replacing a water filter on the boat until well after 7.

Dinner at last! The candles are flickering, and everyone’s ready to eat, and you may find yourself nervous that you haven’t made enough food, particularly because you’ve seen the damage that the big fellow who came with Jim’s sister put on the clams. Never worry. Put everything out as a buffet, or arrange platters family-style at the table, and let your guests have at the feast. The modern parable of the loaves and fishes does not require a miracle, merely adherence to a social contract that makes everyone responsible for ensuring there’s enough food for all. I have served these meals for more than 20 years. There is almost always enough food for all. Indeed, and particularly for those just starting out, there are usually leftovers. The best dinner parties offer memories that last a long time, and a few extra meals besides.

Consumers, businesses and politicians have gotten accustomed to — some would say spoiled by — low interest rates.

The central bank’s benchmark interest rate is zero, and investors are so desperate for safe places to put their money that corporations like Daimler, the German automotive giant, have been able to issue bonds that pay no interest.

Low interest rates have also weakened the euro against the dollar and other currencies, a boon for exporters whose products are usually cheaper for foreign customers as a result. The euro will most likely rise as monetary policy returns to normal.

The eurozone economy is humming, but that may be no insurance against another crisis. Such events have occurred regularly since the world’s economic powers abandoned fixed exchange rates in 1973, a recent report by analysts at Deutsche Bank pointed out.

“It would therefore take a huge leap of faith to say that crises won’t continue to be a regular feature of the current financial system,” said the report, which listed the withdrawal of central bank support as one factor that could trigger the next meltdown.

To avoid provoking renewed turmoil, the European Central Bank is moving cautiously.

The central bank’s Governing Council stressed in a statement on Thursday that it “stands ready” to increase the asset purchases in response to worsening financial conditions or if inflation failed to rise.

“Ideally, the E.C.B. would like to announce tapering as noiselessly as possible,” analysts at Dutch bank ING wrote in a note to clients.

In addition, historically low interest rates will remain in place for the foreseeable future. The central bank has said it will not begin raising rates until it has stopped buying bonds, and only if the eurozone inflation rate is on track to hit the official target of 2 percent.

Still, some economists fear that the end of nearly free money will come as a shock for some weaker companies, free-spending consumers and overly indebted governments.

“The success of a relaxed monetary course is apparent not at the beginning, but when it ends,” Jörg Krämer, the chief economist of Commerzbank and a critic of central bank policies, said in a note to clients. “There are many risks involved, and the longer the E.C.B. delays before changing course, the greater they become.”","As European Central Bank Eases Emergency Measures, Risks May Lurk",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/european-central-bank-tapering-draghi.html

How will Mr. Flake’s decision not to seek another term affect the race in Arizona? According to Ms. Roberts, not having Mr. Flake as a primary opponent is bad news for the Bannon-backed candidate, Kelli Ward, whose “entire campaign was ‘I’m not Sanctuary Senator Jeff Flake.’” Now, Ms. Ward will probably be challenged by an establishment Republican with a better shot to win than Mr. Flake did. It is also bad news for the Democratic candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, who was hoping to run against Ms. Ward in the general election.

No industry in America spends more on lobbying than health care.

In 2016, the health care industry spent half a billion dollars on lobbying, with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health professionals making the largest contributions. In 2009, the year the Affordable Care Act was debated, health care lobbying exceeded $550 million. (Last year, by comparison, defense lobbying totaled $129 million, and the gun lobby spent just $10.5 million.)

Closely related to industry lobbying is the political maneuvering that congressional leaders use in an effort to pass legislation — specifically, targeted provisions known as earmarks, “sweeteners” or pork barrel spending.

The final version of the Graham-Cassidy health bill, for example, would have sent extra money to Alaska and Maine for the crucial votes of senators from those states, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. In 2010, Democrats hoping to secure votes from reluctant rural state senators added the “Frontier States” provision to the A.C.A., which increased Medicare payments to five states with low population densities.

We all know earmarks and lobbying influence policymakers and policy. In health care, this has critical implications: who gets care, how much they get, how we pay for it. But there’s little hard data on exactly who benefits and how large the effects can be. A new study illuminates the ways these political dynamics can change congressional and hospital behavior — and how they can increase health care costs for the rest of us.

Research by Zack Cooper, Amanda Kowalski and Jennifer Wu at Yale and by Eleanor Powell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed a provision in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (M.M.A.), known as Section 508, that helped secure Republican votes for the law’s passage.

The M.M.A., which created Medicare Part D and provided prescription drug coverage for seniors, was a political priority for President George W. Bush ahead of his 2004 re-election campaign. But fiscally conservative Republicans were hesitant to sign on to what amounted to the largest expansion of Medicare in its history, and the bill seemed unlikely to pass.

That’s when Section 508 was added.

The rate at which Medicare pays individual hospitals is determined largely by a hospital’s location and the labor costs, or wage index, in its area. Hospitals can, however, request to be reclassified into a different wage index area to raise their payments. Sometimes there are good reasons for this: Two hospitals might be competing in the same region, and because they’re separated by an arbitrary bureaucratic line, one gets paid more than the other.

But Section 508 waivers created new, more ambiguous ways that hospitals in specific districts could appeal their assigned wage index, and gave the executive branch considerable discretion about which requests would be granted and how big the pay increases would be.

The Section 508 waivers had large effects on how both politicians and hospitals operated. About 400 hospitals applied for a Medicare pay increase, and 120 waivers were granted. Hospitals in districts represented by a Republican member of Congress who voted for the M.M.A. were seven times more likely to receive a waiver compared with those in districts of members who voted against it. On average, these hospitals saw a 6.5 percent increase in Medicare payments, but the 29 hospitals with the biggest payment increases — “high 508 recipient hospitals” — received a 10 percent boost.

How did hospitals spend the extra money? Perhaps unsurprisingly, they started treating more Medicare patients — about 8 percent more per year. They also expanded nursing staffing by roughly a third, and invested in new technologies. But extra cash also meant big raises for hospital C.E.O.s: nearly half a million dollars per year at each hospital. Over all, “high 508 recipient hospitals” had $1.25 billion in additional spending from 2005 to 2010 — about 25 percent more than they otherwise would have. There was no evidence of improved quality or outcomes.

“If you told me in advance that we’d find this tight a link between Congress and hospitals, I would have been very surprised,” Mr. Cooper said. “We knew there was some connection, of course, but the more we kept digging, the stronger and more precise the link became.”

Section 508 payment changes were supposed to expire after three years. But hospitals with lucrative waivers had considerable interest in seeing the program extended, and worked together to form the Section 508 Hospital Coalition.

In the years between passage of the M.M.A., and its reauthorization in 2007, legislators in districts with a Section 508 hospital saw a 22 percent rise in total campaign contributions, and a 65 percent increase in donations from the health care sector specifically. In the end, a provision that budgeted $900 million over three years led to billions in extra spending for nearly a decade.

Pork, it seems, is as bad for budgets as it is for waistlines.

“Every time you pass legislation, big or small, these elements are added in,” Mr. Cooper said. “It’s not that any single one is hugely offensive. It’s their accumulation and continuation over time.”

Although Mr. Cooper’s research offers perhaps the clearest empirical glimpse of the links between lobbying, earmarks and medical spending, this political maneuvering is not new — and Medicare hospital payment seems to be a particularly susceptible target.

Both Democrats and Republicans have won pay increases for hospitals they represent. In the 1999 budget, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert reclassified hospitals in their districts into other regions, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra funding per year.

About a dozen years later, in what was called the Bay State Boondoggle , John Kerry, then a senator, succeeded in lobbying for Medicare to pay Massachusetts’ urban hospitals at the same rate it paid the state’s rural hospitals. The catch: There was only one hospital that qualified as “rural” in Massachusetts — on the wealthy island of Nantucket.

None of this is surprising. A primary motive of elected representatives is getting re-elected. Passing expansive legislation — like Medicare Part D or the A.C.A. — is hard, especially when legislators can’t point to specific benefits for their constituents. But a critical flaw in our current system is that payments are hugely influenced by politicians who have every incentive to increase them for their own districts.

“You can’t get upset at a snake for having fangs,” Mr. Cooper told me. “We need to design a system that takes payment decisions out of the hands of elected representatives. We think of interest rates as so important and complicated that we’ve tried to remove politics and give the responsibility to the Fed. The same argument holds for health care. When the government spends a trillion dollars on health care, it’s too easy for members to direct funds to their districts.”

We’ve been close to a possible solution. The A.C.A. called for establishing an Independent Payment Advisory Board , a 15-member panel charged with making changes to Medicare to control costs. The proposed reforms would have been put into effect unless Congress introduced alternate policies to achieve the same savings. But the advisory board faced fierce bipartisan opposition and was never created.

America’s increasingly burdensome health care spending has many roots: new technologies, high drug prices, fragmented care, administrative expenses and the like. But lobbying and political maneuvering can increase costs, too — without clear benefits for patients, communities or society at large.

Often these costs are borne by all of us, while the benefits — if any — go to a favored few. Excess medical spending, then, is driven not only by inefficiencies in our health system, but also by those in our political system. Our solutions, it seems, must confront that uncomfortable reality.

Among video game developers, it’s called “crunch”: a sudden spike in work hours, as many as 20 a day, that can last for days or weeks on end. During this time, they sleep at work, limit bathroom breaks and cut out anything that pulls their attention away from their screens, including family and even food. Crunch makes the industry roll — but it’s taking a serious toll on its workers.

In late 2011, as he was finishing up production on the role-playing game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the programmer Jean Simonet started feeling severe stomach pains. At first, doctors were perplexed. But on his third emergency room visit, he revealed that he’d been regularly staying at the office late and coming in on weekends to fix bugs and add features that he thought would take Skyrim from good to great, no matter how much sleep he lost along the way.

He took his doctor’s advice and took the next few weeks off work, trying to relax and acclimate to a normal sleep schedule. With this hiatus from crunch, “eventually the pain just disappeared,” he said.

Anecdotes like this are common in the video game industry, which generated $30.4 billion in the United States last year but has a human cost that can’t be calculated. The designer Clint Hocking described suffering memory loss as a result of the stress and anxiety of crunching on a game. Brett Douville, a veteran game programmer, said he once worked so long and for so hard that he found himself temporarily unable to step out of his car.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html

I’d like to take seriously the chief justice’s evident worry about the Supreme Court’s legitimacy and play it out a bit. The concern is not a new one for John Roberts. It infused his dissenting opinion two years ago in the same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. Last April, shortly after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice Roberts spoke at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and expressed the fear that the sharply partisan confirmation process would damage the court in the public’s view.

“It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,” he said then, adding: “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.”

So I can only imagine what the chief justice felt last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, stood next to President Trump and made this public declaration: “The single most significant thing this president has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.”

And assuming, as I do, that Chief Justice Roberts is a close student of public opinion polls, I wonder what he makes of a new Gallup Poll, out last month, showing that for the first time since 2008 more Americans say the Supreme Court is too conservative rather than too liberal. The gap isn’t huge — 30 percent “too conservative” to 23 percent “too liberal” — but the shift in public perception is sudden and significant. In 2015-16, following the same-sex marriage ruling, “too liberal” outstripped “too conservative” with a gap of 17 percent. Gallup’s analysis suggests that the shift may be less because of any specific cases than of public knowledge that Republicans control two branches of government and seem to be in a position to exert heavy influence on the third. In other words, the public is seeing the court and its future not in isolation but in context.

The chief justice also has to know that for the first time in the court’s modern history, the individual justices are ideologically aligned with the party of the president who appointed them. There are no crossovers, no William Brennan or Harry Blackmun or John Paul Stevens, Republican-appointed justices who ended their careers as liberals, and no Byron White, appointed by President John F. Kennedy and a dissenter from the court’s liberal rulings on abortion and criminal procedure. That in itself is cause for concern for a chief justice inclined to worry that people will look at Supreme Court justices and see partisans.

I assume these thoughts were not far from his mind as he mused aloud during the gerrymander argument. And I’d like to suggest that rather than wringing their hands, progressives might take heart. Whatever happens with this case — a harder case than many good-government types have admitted publicly or even privately — there are many more political hot-button cases on their way to the Supreme Court: voter ID cases, racially discriminatory redistricting cases, even other gerrymander challenges litigated under different constitutional theories.

In the recent past, Chief Justice Roberts has seemed to me a bit too openly eager to get the court’s hands on these issues. Twice in the past term, the court decided against taking up highly charged political cases. It let stand lower court rulings that invalidated a voter ID requirement in Texas and that deemed discriminatory a series of voting changes in North Carolina. In each case, the chief justice, writing only for himself, issued statements to underscore that the court was bypassing the cases for essentially procedural reasons and not because the justices agreed with the lower court rulings. These solitary personal statements in the Texas and North Carolina cases served no purpose that I could discern other than to keep up the spirits of the states that would continue to defend their problematic statutes.

The Texas voter ID case is highly likely to return to the court. When it does, and when similar cases arrive at the Supreme Court’s door as the next redistricting cycle grows ever closer, will the chief justice take the court into the fray, or will he think back to what he said to Paul Smith and decide that the court’s interests are best served by sitting it out?",Will Politics Tarnish the Supreme Court’s Legitimacy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/politics-supreme-court-legitimacy.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

AKRON, Ohio — Drug overdose deaths in 2016 most likely exceeded 59,000, the largest annual jump ever recorded in the United States, according to preliminary data compiled by The New York Times.

The death count is the latest consequence of an escalating public health crisis: opioid addiction, now made more deadly by an influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and similar drugs. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50.

Although the data is preliminary, the Times’s best estimate is that deaths rose 19 percent over the 52,404 recorded in 2015. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017.

Drug overdose deaths, 1980 to 2016 *Estimate based on preliminary data

Because drug deaths take a long time to certify, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be able to calculate final numbers until December. The Times compiled estimates for 2016 from hundreds of state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners. Together they represent data from states and counties that accounted for 76 percent of overdose deaths in 2015. They are a first look at the extent of the drug overdose epidemic last year, a detailed accounting of a modern plague.

The initial data points to large increases in drug overdose deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, we estimate overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.

“Heroin is the devil’s drug, man. It is,” Cliff Parker said, sitting on a bench in Grace Park in Akron. Mr. Parker, 24, graduated from high school not too far from here, in nearby Copley, where he was a multisport athlete. In his senior year, he was a varsity wrestler and earned a scholarship to the University of Akron. Like his friends and teammates, he started using prescription painkillers at parties. It was fun, he said. By the time it stopped being fun, it was too late. Pills soon turned to heroin, and his life began slipping away from him.

Mr. Parker’s story is familiar in the Akron area. From a distance, it would be easy to paint Akron — “Rubber Capital of the World” — as a stereotypical example of Rust Belt decay. But that’s far from a complete picture. While manufacturing jobs have declined and the recovery from the 2008 recession has been slow, unemployment in Summit County, where Akron sits, is roughly in line with the United States as a whole. The Goodyear factories have been retooled into technology centers for research and polymer science. The city has begun to rebuild. But deaths from drug overdose here have skyrocketed.

In 2016, Summit County had 312 drug deaths, according to Gary Guenther, the county medical examiner’s chief investigator — a 46 percent increase from 2015 and more than triple the 99 cases that went through the medical examiner’s office just two years before. There were so many last year, Mr. Guenther said, that on three separate occasions the county had to request refrigerated trailers to store the bodies because they’d run out of space in the morgue.

It’s not unique to Akron. Coroners’ offices throughout the state are being overwhelmed.

In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 99 tested positive for fentanyl or an analogue.

Fentanyl isn’t new. But over the past three years, it has been popping up in drug seizures across the country.

Most of the time, it’s sold on the street as heroin, or drug traffickers use it to make cheap counterfeit prescription opioids. Fentanyls are showing up in cocaine as well, contributing to an increase in cocaine-related overdoses.

The most deadly of the fentanyl analogues is carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer 5,000 times stronger than heroin. An amount smaller than a few grains of salt can be a lethal dose.

“July 5th, 2016 — that’s the day carfentanil hit the streets of Akron,” said Capt. Michael Shearer, the commander of the Narcotics Unit for the Akron Police Department. On that day, 17 people overdosed and one person died in a span of nine hours. Over the next six months, the county medical examiner recorded 140 overdose deaths of people testing positive for carfentanil. Just three years earlier, there were fewer than a hundred drug overdose deaths of any kind for the entire year.

This exponential growth in overdose deaths in 2016 didn't extend to all parts of the country. In some states in the western half of the U.S., our data suggests deaths may have leveled off or even declined. According to Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert in heroin use in the United States, this geographic variation may reflect a historical divide in the nation’s heroin market between the powdered heroin generally found east of the Mississippi River and the Mexican black tar heroin found to the west.

This divide may have kept deaths down in the West for now, but according to Dr. Ciccarone, there is little evidence of differences in the severity of opioid addiction or heroin use. If drug traffickers begin to shift production and distribution in the West from black tar to powdered heroin in large quantities, fentanyl will most likely come along with it, and deaths will rise.

First responders are finding that, with fentanyl and carfentanil, the overdoses can be so severe that multiple doses of naloxone — the anti-overdose medication that often goes by the brand name Narcan — are needed to pull people out. In Warren County in Ohio, Doyle Burke, the chief investigator at the county coroner’s office, has been watching the number of drug deaths rise as the effectiveness of Narcan falls. “E.M.S. crews are hitting them with 12, 13, 14 hits of Narcan with no effect,” said Mr. Burke, likening a shot of Narcan to “a squirt gun in a house fire.”

Early data from 2017 suggests that drug overdose deaths will continue to rise this year. It’s the only aspect of American health, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., that is getting significantly worse. Over two million Americans are estimated to be dependent on opioids, and an additional 95 million used prescription painkillers in the past year — more than used tobacco. “This epidemic, it’s got no face,” said Chris Eisele, the president of the Warren County Fire Chiefs’ Association and fire chief of Deerfield Township. The Narcotics Anonymous meetings here are populated by lawyers, accountants, young adults and teenagers who described comfortable middle-class upbringings.

Back in Akron, Mr. Parker has been clean for seven months, though he is still living on the streets. The ground of the park is littered with discarded needles, and many among the homeless here are current or former heroin users. Like most recovering from addiction, Mr. Parker needed several tries to get clean — six, by his count. The severity of opioid withdrawal means users rarely get clean unless they are determined and have treatment readily available. “No one wants their family to find them face down with a needle in their arm,” Mr. Parker said. “But no one stops until they’re ready.”

About the data

Our count of drug overdoses for 2016 is an estimate. A precise number of drug overdose deaths will not be available until December.

As the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics at the C.D.C., Robert Anderson oversees the collection and codification of the nation’s mortality data. He noted that toxicology results, which are necessary to assign a cause of death, can take three to six months or longer. “It’s frustrating, because we really do want to track this stuff,” he said, describing how timely data on cause of death would let public health workers allocate resources in the right places.

To come up with our count, we contacted state health departments in all 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, asking for their statistics on drug overdose deaths among residents. In states that didn't have numbers available, we turned to county medical examiners and coroners’ offices. In some cases, partial results were extrapolated through the end of the year to get estimates for 2016.

While noting the difficulty of making predictions, Mr. Anderson reviewed The Times’s estimates and said they seemed reasonable. The overdose death rate reported by the N.C.H.S. provisional estimates for the first half of 2016 would imply a total of 59,779 overdose deaths, if the death rate remains flat through the second half of the year. Based on our reporting, we believe this rate increased.

While the process in each state varies slightly, death certificates are usually first filled out by a coroner, medical examiner or attending physician. These death certificates are then collected by state health departments and sent to the N.C.H.S., which assigns what’s called an ICD-10 code to each death. This code specifies the underlying cause of death, and it’s what determines whether a death is classified as a drug overdose.

Sometimes, the cases are straightforward; other times, it’s not so easy. The people in charge of coding each death — called nosologists — have to differentiate between deaths due to drug overdose and those due to the long-term effects of drug abuse, which get a different code. (There were 2,573 such deaths in 2015.) When alcohol and drugs are both present, they must specify which of the two was the underlying cause. If it’s alcohol, it’s not a “drug overdose” under the commonly used definition. Ideally, every medical examiner, coroner and attending physician would fill out death certificates with perfect consistency, but there are often variations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction that can introduce inconsistencies to the data.

These inconsistencies are part of the reason there is a delay in drug death reporting, and among the reasons we can still only estimate the number of drug overdoses in 2016. Since we compiled our data from state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners directly, the deaths have not yet been assigned ICD-10 codes by the N.C.H.S. — that is, the official underlying cause of death has not yet been categorized. In addition, the mortality data in official statistics focuses on deaths among residents. But county coroners typically count up whichever deaths come through their office, regardless of residency. When there were large discrepancies between the 2015 counts from the C.D.C. and the state or county, we used the percent change from 2015 to calculate our 2016 estimate.

We can say with confidence that drug deaths rose a great deal in 2016, but it is hard to say precisely how many died or in which places drug deaths rose most steeply. Because of the delay associated with toxicology reports and inconsistencies in the reported data, our exact estimate — 62,497 total drug overdose deaths — could vary from the true number by several thousand.",Drug Deaths in America Are Rising Faster Than Ever,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html

On Wednesday, Judge Chhabria concluded that “both sides have reasonable arguments’’ on the main legal question: Whether Congress appropriated money for the cost-sharing payments.
After initially endorsing the deal, Mr. Trump backed off a day later, and the White House demanded changes as a condition of its support.
In his Wednesday ruling, Judge Chhabria wrote that low-income people who now have silver plans in some cases may be able to find gold plans with lower premiums and lower deductibles for 2018.
In addition, it said, three-fourths of consumers in the state who are eligible for assistance will be able to buy low-cost bronze health plans next year for less than $10 a month.","The subsidies reimburse insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people who buy midlevel silver plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Under the law, insurers will still have to provide the discounts, known as cost-sharing reductions, but may be unable to collect reimbursement from the government.

Mr. Trump ordered federal officials two weeks ago to stop making the monthly payments. Another federal district judge, in Washington, ruled in 2016 that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress had never appropriated money for them.

On Wednesday, Judge Chhabria concluded that “both sides have reasonable arguments’’ on the main legal question: Whether Congress appropriated money for the cost-sharing payments.

Two senior senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, announced last week that they had agreed on a bill to extend the cost-sharing payments through 2019 and make it easier for states to obtain waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act. After initially endorsing the deal, Mr. Trump backed off a day later, and the White House demanded changes as a condition of its support.

The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the Alexander-Murray bill would produce a modest reduction in federal budget deficits, but would not substantially change the number of people with coverage.

The budget office estimated that the legislation would reduce deficits by a total of $3.8 billion over the next decade. With the deficit for the last fiscal year alone reaching $666 billion, that is a relatively small number, but supporters of the bill made the most of it.

“The Congressional Budget Office has found that our proposal benefits taxpayers, it benefits consumers — not insurance companies,” said Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee.

The proposal has broad support from Democratic senators and at least a dozen Republican senators. But conservative Republicans in the House and the Senate have denounced it as a bailout for insurers, and Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he supports it. Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, called the measure “a nonstarter.”

The budget office said that continuing the cost-sharing payments would not change its estimate of federal spending because it had already assumed that the government would pay the subsidies: $9 billion a year in 2018 and 2019, and a total of $99 billion from 2018 to 2027.

The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a new version of the HealthCare.gov website showing premiums and other details of health insurance plans that will be offered for sale in the open enrollment period that starts next week.

In many markets, consumers will have few choices and will see high sticker prices before taking account of financial assistance for which they may qualify. But by carefully shopping around, consumers will often be able to find bargains — a point highlighted in the case in California, where the state runs its own marketplace.

During Monday’s hearing, state officials told Judge Chhabria that cutting off the subsidy payments would cause immediate and irreparable harm to states and to consumers, increasing the likelihood that insurers would pull out of the marketplace.

But Judge Chhabria said California and most of the other state plaintiffs “saw the writing on the wall a long time ago — that the administration was going to terminate these payments to insurance companies to subsidize co-payments and deductibles.”

“California is doing a really good job of responding to the termination of these payments in a way that is not only avoiding harm for people, but actually benefiting people,” the judge added.

In his Wednesday ruling, Judge Chhabria wrote that low-income people who now have silver plans in some cases may be able to find gold plans with lower premiums and lower deductibles for 2018.

To offset the expected loss of cost-sharing subsidies, California added a surcharge to the price of midlevel silver plans sold on its Affordable Care Act marketplace. When premiums go up, consumers receive more financial assistance to help with premium costs, so in many cases they will be no worse off.

“Nearly four out of five consumers will see their premiums stay the same or decrease, since the amount of financial help they receive will also rise,” California’s insurance marketplace announced earlier this month. In addition, it said, three-fourths of consumers in the state who are eligible for assistance will be able to buy low-cost bronze health plans next year for less than $10 a month.

“The state of California is standing on the courthouse steps denouncing the president for taking away people’s health care,” Judge Chhabria said at Monday’s hearing, “when the truth is that California has come up with a solution to that issue that is going to result in better health care for a lot of people.”

Many other states have taken similar steps to minimize harm to consumers, the judge said.

As tall and commanding in a suit as he was in a uniform, Mr. Kelly has become a central figure in Mr. Trump’s orbit. After six months in the cabinet as secretary of homeland security, Mr. Kelly took over a turbulent and tribal White House last summer and by most accounts imposed more order on the building and staff, if not the Twitter-obsessed president himself.

Mr. Kelly’s focus on improving information flow and decision making in the West Wing gave the impression of a good soldier mainly concerned with process. But that obscured a player who expresses his own sharp views in selected areas, most notably immigration, where he shares Mr. Trump’s commitment to toughening the border and deporting many in the country illegally. His views were forged in part by his time heading the United States Southern Command, which oversees American military operations and security in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.

Mr. Kelly not only expressed willingness to curb refugees coming into the country — in the end, Mr. Trump lowered the cap to 45,000 — he embraced Mr. Trump’s various attempts to close the border to visitors from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. He aggressively turned up the heat on internal immigration enforcement, stepping up deportation of undocumented immigrants, even those without serious criminal records, reversing an Obama administration policy.

Under Mr. Kelly’s leadership, the Department of Homeland Security also went after undocumented parents who bring their children into the country. He directed immigration officials to lodge smuggling charges against the parents, saying they were putting children in danger.

“Kelly has been an enabler of Trump’s mission,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant homeland security secretary under Mr. Obama. “Judge him that way.”

His image as a steady, nonideological figure trying to restore order in the White House in the face of a radical president, she added, was not true. Mr. Kelly, she said, was not “the savior or the hostage.”

Other Democrats have expressed alarm at Mr. Kelly’s views on immigration. At a dinner including Mr. Trump and the Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Kelly gave an extended critique of Mexico, calling it a third-world country in danger of collapsing the way Venezuela has and arguing that the United States needed to guard itself against that, according to people informed about the conversation.

But Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who recommended Mr. Kelly to Mr. Trump last winter, said the retired general’s background gave him an understanding of the dangers and drawbacks of unfettered immigration. “He knows a lot of the challenges that we face south of the border,” Mr. Cotton said, adding that the issue is “something that he’s lived on a firsthand basis for years.”

Like Mr. Panetta, he pointed to Mr. Kelly’s upbringing.

“I think he appreciates the struggles of America’s working class — the blue-collar workers over the last 30, 40 years, the kind of people who have to take a shower after they get off work, not before they go to work — and the impact that mass unskilled and low-skilled immigration has had on working-class wages in our society,” Mr. Cotton said.

As a cabinet officer, Mr. Kelly frequently lashed out at critics. In March, during a meeting with members of Arab and Muslim communities in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Kelly threatened to walk out after being posed hard questions about the travel ban and what participants saw as the targeting of Muslim Americans at ports of entry, according to people in attendance.

During a speech in April, Mr. Kelly rebuked members of Congress who complained about what they called overly aggressive immigration enforcement.

“If lawmakers do not like the laws they’ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws,” Mr. Kelly said defiantly. “Otherwise, they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.”

That drew a rebuke from Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas. “I don’t think it’s correct for you to tell members of Congress to shut up,” he said.

Mr. Kelly has also engaged in testy public debates with Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California. During a June meeting, Ms. Harris and Mr. Kelly engaged in a contentious back-and-forth as she questioned him about Trump administration threats to cut off funding for so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

All of that foreshadowed his attack last week on Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who publicly accused Mr. Trump of insensitivity when he called the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, who was killed this month in Niger. Mr. Kelly called her an “empty barrel” and told an unflattering story about her that was proved untrue by videotape of the event he mentioned.

Mr. Kelly decided himself to head out to the White House briefing room to defend the president, colleagues said, and most of his remarks reflected on his own experience as the father of a slain Marine and the nature of military service. He brought tears to the eyes of other White House aides, who afterward traded emails expressing admiration for Mr. Kelly’s passionate defense of Mr. Trump. It was only afterward that they began to see how the attack on Ms. Wilson came to overshadow the emotion of the first part of his speech.

Mr. Kelly was surprised by the criticism of his speech, colleagues said, but he has not apologized to Ms. Wilson for making false statements about her. White House officials said they opted against it to avoid extending the story.

Mr. Panetta said Mr. Kelly’s attack on a congresswoman reflected his lack of experience in high-level politics. “He knows where the land mines are in the Marines, but he doesn’t know where the land mines are in politics,” Mr. Panetta said. “And he’ll make mistakes as a result, and he certainly made mistakes last week in going after people in that news conference.”

But, he said, it was authentic: “As somebody who worked with this guy, a lot of what he got up to say is a reflection of who John Kelly is.”","Pitched as Calming Force, John Kelly Instead Mirrors Boss’s Priorities",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/trump-kelly.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

Many of those who remain will have to accommodate the president to survive primaries from the pro-Trump right. Already, in the high-profile campaigns of 2017 — governor races in Virginia and New Jersey and a special Senate race in Alabama — Republican candidates are mirroring Mr. Trump’s racially tinged campaign tactics. And Republican officials are putting up with the sort of incendiary candidacy that a party more devoted to nurturing a tolerant image might have rejected.

The reason? Many of their voters prefer the Trump way.

“We’re not an element,” said Laura Ingraham, a pro-Trump talk show host. “We’re the party.”

Ms. Ingraham, the author of a new book, “Billionaire at the Barricades,” on the populist uprising that helped elect Mr. Trump, said the conservatism of market-oriented internationalism simply has little mass appeal.

“There’s no constituency for open borders, endless war and these international trade deals that are skewed against the United States,” she said.

As for the limited government pitch that defined Mr. Flake’s career, Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, scoffed.

“This thing they’ve got today doesn’t work, it doesn’t move with urgency,” said Mr. Bannon, who is now orchestrating an effort to defeat Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump’s agenda. “It’s very nice. But it’s a theoretical exercise. It can’t win national elections.”

Even some of the president’s detractors on the right believe that the party base will stick with him because they like his agenda.

“We have a leader who has a personality disorder,” said former Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, “but he’s done what he actually told the people he was going to do, and they’re not going to abandon him.”

This grass-roots loyalty is why no prominent Republicans on the ballot next year have broken with Mr. Trump — only lame-duck lawmakers and Republicans out of office, such as former President George W. Bush, have been harshly critical of him.

At the moment, congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are trying to make common cause of an overhaul of the tax code because they see it as something of a temporary cure-all. A bill-signing ceremony on taxes would hand lawmakers something to run on next year and the president a much-needed accomplishment.

“It stops the bleeding,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina.

But even that holds risks. A tax cut that skews heavily toward corporations and the rich would hardly dislodge the populist view of a Republican establishment beholden to its donors.

“I don’t think the rank-and-file Republican believes that corporations are people,” said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to the Trump campaign who has also worked with Mr. Bannon. He was mimicking a Mitt Romney quote that earned Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, ridicule for being out of touch.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump painted a rosy picture of the party.

“We have, actually, great unity in the Republican Party,” he told reporters before leaving for a fund-raiser in Texas.

But even as Mr. Trump won repeated standing ovations from Senate Republicans on Tuesday when he visited their weekly lunch at the Capitol, the party’s lingering tensions were also on display. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, a longtime member of the Agriculture Committee, expressed concern about whether Mr. Trump would pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Republican present at the luncheon.

How aggressively the president pursues his platform on trade and immigration restrictionism could test how strong his grip is on Congress.

For now, though, the vision for a more populist-nationalist party sketched out by Mr. Bannon is being won as much through intimidation as through actual purges in Republican primaries.

What Mr. Bannon is trying to do — and what Mr. Flake’s retirement could further — is strike fear in the hearts of Republicans who do not display enough enthusiasm for the nationalism that Mr. Trump ran on.

“This should be a warning shot to any other ‘Never Trumper’ in the Senate today: Your time is up,” Mr. Surabian said.

That is playing out not only in the examples of Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

In Nevada and Mississippi, Senators Dean Heller and Roger Wicker have responded to Trump-inspired primary threats by taking steps to emphasize their fealty to Mr. Trump.

On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, endorsed former Judge Roy S. Moore in the Alabama Senate race, praising Mr. Moore, a caustic social conservative, as “a tireless advocate led by principle rather than politics.” Mr. Cornyn is the highest ranking Republican to formally back Mr. Moore.

But accommodation is not giving pause to would-be rivals. Danny Tarkanian, Mr. Heller’s Republican challenger, said the conversation among activists was no longer dominated by finding the most conservative candidates.

“The talk I hear is, ‘Hey, who’s going to support Trump’s “America First” policies,’” said Mr. Tarkanian, citing trade, military intervention and what he described as “worrying more about refugees from other countries than our own people.”

In the House, some lawmakers who have previously spoken out against Mr. Trump, such as Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, are now working to repair their relationship with the White House.

“The message they’re sending is: The way to survive is by accommodating him, changing their tone and professing loyalty to Trump,” said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard and a vociferous Trump critic.

The two governor’s races this year also illustrate Mr. Trump’s influence in the party. In Virginia and New Jersey, the establishment-aligned Republican nominees for governor, Ed Gillespie and Kim Guadagno, are airing controversial ads on immigration to both stir their base and win over some independents concerned about crimes committed by those in the country illegally. Mr. Gillespie, a veteran Washington lobbyist who served in George W. Bush’s White House, is also running ads extolling his support for Confederate statues.

In the Senate, Republicans have made clear that they will welcome Mr. Moore of Alabama — who has a decades-long history of making inflammatory comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims — to their ranks should he win the special election in December to fill the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. A handful of conservative writers have expressed concern about the message that tolerating Mr. Moore sends, but no high-profile lawmaker has followed suit, and a pair of Republican senators are even hosting a fund-raiser for him next month in Washington.

And in Colorado, former Representative Tom Tancredo, who was shunned by the Bush-era Republican Party for his harsh anti-immigration views, is considering a comeback bid for governor in 2018.

Whether Mr. Trump permanently realigns the party around his style and platform may depend on how much he remains true to what could be called Trumpism.

Mr. Graham believes that the president is not as wedded to some of his nationalist policies as his supporters want to believe.

“The best thing that could happen to Trump and the future of the Republican Party is for Trump to fix a broken immigration system,” Mr. Graham said.

By calling last week to offer his support to a handful of Republican senators that Mr. Bannon had named as potential targets, the president demonstrated he would not blindly follow his former adviser.

Establishment Republicans are attempting to convince Mr. Trump that “if you join with Bannon, you cut your own throat,” Mr. Graham said, because it could lead to an impeachment effort by a Democratic-controlled Congress.

But these arguments cause the early Trump enthusiasts only to roll their eyes. The party establishment, these Trump backers say, wants to govern as if the election never happened.

Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.

Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will’s D&D buddies — Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) — find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine’s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).

The new season’s biggest strength is how it deals with Will’s trauma. He’s a frail kid who’s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn’t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show’s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder’s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.

For a breakout hit, “Stranger Things 2” mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show’s teen characters for much of the season), but they’re grounded in the story and characters.

And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown’s transfixing stare, into “The Eleven Show.”

“Stranger Things” has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyce’s amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates. Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though it’s made out of movies. Parts of the new season recall “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Gremlins,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and, naturally, the Reese’s Pieces sequence in “E.T.” For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes “The Outsiders,” complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.

When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there’s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of ’80s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. “No one wants to be Winston!” he says. “He joined the team super late, he’s not funny and he’s not even a scientist.”

The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he’s made up a story. “I really liked it,” she says. “I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.”

That would be a fair critique of “Stranger Things 2,” which reprises many of Season 1’s arcs and twists. (The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by — well, you’ll see.) I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.

But it’s a still a good time, it’s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of ’80s horror with the heart of an ’80s teen romance. It may be last year’s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn’t mean it can’t still be sweet.

It is dangerous to a democracy.”

Steve Evans, a Salt Lake City lawyer who writes about Mormon topics on the website By Common Consent, said it was no coincidence that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints like Mr. Flake and Mitt Romney would be among “the major headliners of anti-Trumpism.”

“This is borne out of a strong sense of personal morality, but also out of a cultural sense of decorum,” Mr. Evans said. “Mormons are prudes both privately and publicly. But there is also strong scriptural teaching behind it all. The Book of Mormon warns the reader that America is a choice land, that we must be careful in choosing our leaders, and the judgments of God can come on a people that choose evil leaders. Religious teachings like these may be informing their worldview.”

Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president ran into considerable antipathy in heavily Mormon Utah, where Republican candidates usually coast to victory. Evan McMullin, a Mormon and a former C.I.A. officer and policy director for House Republicans who ran as an independent in 2016, received 21 percent of the vote in the state. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won 27 percent, so altogether, more Utahans voted against Mr. Trump (48 percent) than for him (45 percent).

Max Perry Mueller, an assistant professor of American religion at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said he heard so many religious overtones in Mr. Flake’s speech that he plans to set aside his next planned lesson for the American religious history class he teaches, and instead have his students deconstruct the senator’s remarks “as a Mormon speech.”

Professor Mueller said the speech reminded him of the cadence, tone and themes that Mormon leaders often use when addressing the church’s vast general conference meetings in Salt Lake City, calling on members to refuse to accommodate the immorality of the larger world.

“That speech reflects a Mormon understanding of human agency and participation in history, that humans bring about change, and move the world towards perfection,” said Professor Mueller, the author of “Race and the Making of the Mormon People.”

In one passage near the end of his speech, Mr. Flake said: “This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more, and I say, the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise.”

In the telephone interview, Mr. Flake spoke of his deep involvement with his church, of serving as a missionary in South Africa and Zimbabwe in the 1980s, and of rarely missing a Sunday service with his family in Mesa, Ariz., over his 17 years in Congress.

But he emphasized that he did not want to imply that he received any direction in his political choices from his church or its leaders. Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, said it had a longstanding policy of political neutrality and would make no comment.

For the note of optimism that he struck at the end of his floor speech, Mr. Flake said he drew on a family motto that his parents had posted on the refrigerator at home: “Assume the best, always look for the good.”

“That certainly is informed by our faith,” he said, “and who we ought to be.”

He said he had to remind himself that in the end, what will matter more than his status or his job will be choosing what is right, as the hymn says.

Benda excoriated them for “the intellectual organization of political hatreds.” He condemned them for worshiping a “cult of success,” which “says that when a will is successful that fact alone gives it a moral value, whereas the will which fails is for that reason alone deserving of contempt.”

He warned, prophetically, that this “great betrayal” of their philosophical vocation, along with their “desire to abase the values of knowledge before the values of action” had put mankind on the road to “the greatest and most perfect war ever seen in the world.”

Benda is often celebrated by conservative writers for his understanding of how prone intellectuals can be to fatal political misjudgments. Think of Michel Foucault’s embrace of Ayatollah Khomeini, Noam Chomsky’s excuses for the Khmer Rouge, or Naomi Klein’s effusions for Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. The list of intellectuals making fools of themselves is long.

So where are Benda’s conservative disciples today, the ones I remember from panel discussions on the importance of moral character, the dangers of relativism, or the post-modern assault on the concept of truth?

Their chief argument for Trump is that he won and is therefore a winner. Their argument against Never Trumpers is that we failed and are therefore losers. What about Trump’s character? It doesn’t matter so long as the Supreme Court remains conservative. Legislative failures are always and only the fault of “establishment Republicans.” Boorish habits are merely a matter of taste and something of a virtue in the era of snowflakes. As for the criticisms from Flake, Bush, Corker and McCain, who needs moral instruction from those sore losers and political has-beens?

Most telling is the Trumpians’ inability ever to utter a whisper of criticism of their man. Even Never Trumpers will occasionally find themselves agreeing with the administration over one issue or another. Not so the Trumpians. With instincts that recall the Stalinist intelligentsia of the 1940s, they mix the logical elasticity of the sophist with the unflinching loyalty of the toady. They are never anything except always all in.

All this suggests that what the media now trumpets as a looming G.O.P. civil war isn’t going to happen. Corker and Flake aren’t stepping up; they’re bowing out. Political retirees are good for leading charities, not movements.

As for the rest of the conservative movement, through its liaison with Trump it is participating in its own moral degradation in much the same way that Xaviera Hollander — a Dutch consular secretary who realized she could make a much better living as a call girl and brothel operator — became the notorious “Happy Hooker” of the 1970s. Shameless, yes. Criminal, also. But a runaway success all the same, with a memoir that sold north of 15 million copies and a movie about her starring Lynn Redgrave.

The default assumption of nearly every opponent of Donald Trump is that, sooner or later, he is bound to fail, either because he will be overwhelmed by events, undermined by scandal or abandoned by his own supporters.

So far, none of that has happened. In one key respect, he is the most successful president in modern times. He has ripped out the ideological foundations on which his party once stood. The Democratic Party was still recognizably itself after Bill Clinton left office. The G.O.P. will not be after Trump is done with it. Like it or not, that’s a testament to his charisma and power — aided and abetted by those conservative intellectuals who proved so quick to prostitute themselves on his behalf.",The Happy Hooker Conservatives,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/the-happy-hooker-conservatives.html

Congressional leaders and Trump administration officials wrote a health care bill that fit that description, and now they’ve drafted a similar tax plan. For a typical person making $7 million, for example, the tax plan would bestow an estimated tax cut of more than $700,000.

The most likely outcome on SALT seems to be a compromise that reduces the deduction without eliminating it. But a compromise won’t solve some of the tensions here. The more of the deduction that remains, the more that the tax plan will increase the deficit, which might scare off some other House members or senators.

These tensions are a big reason that Representative Kevin Brady, the lead writer of the tax bill in the House, suggested yesterday that he and his colleagues may buck President Trump and reduce the tax benefits for 401(k) plans. Doing so would be a way to reduce the bill’s budgetary cost — but, of course, would also anger many taxpayers.

I continue to think that the Republicans are more likely than not to pass a tax cut. The party’s leaders are desperate for a win, and reducing taxes is a core principle for Republicans. But they have made the task more difficult by insisting on such an enormous tax cut for the wealthy. The focus on the wealthy gives them much less flexibility with every other aspect of the bill.

Who knew that tax policy was so complicated?

Flake’s exit. Why has Jeff Flake fared worse in the polls than some of Trump’s other Senate critics, like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski? Josh Barro of Business Insider and Ross Douthat of The Times have both argued that Flake is suffering from the lack of popular support for the traditional Republican agenda. While Collins and Murkowski have occasionally defied Trump on policy, Flake broke with him largely on style and decency.

“Flake is helpless,” Barro writes, “because there’s no real constituency in America for what he favors: low taxes and spending, openness to immigration and trade, international collaboration where America honors its commitments, and polite public behavior.”

Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, offers a more sympathetic take on his colleague’s decision: “I may disagree with Mr. Flake on policy, but I consider him an honorable man, a loyal friend and a valued colleague,” Coons writes in The Times. “His retirement is deeply troubling to me because he represents a principled and patriotic Republican Party, one that has long championed strong American leadership around the world, and one I now fear is falling apart.”",The Republicans’ SALT Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/republicans-tax-cut.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

The most relevant movie precursor to “Thank You for Your Service,” an earnest and powerful drama about Iraq veterans returning to Kansas, is not “The Hurt Locker,” or the well-meaning but toothless coming-home dramas released during the Bush years (“Stop-Loss,” “The Lucky Ones”), or even “American Sniper,” written by Jason Hall, who wrote the screenplay for this film, his feature directing debut.

Mr. Hall, working in a more sentimental, multiplex-friendly mode, makes the same point here. The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post’s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiancée has left him, has been added to the mix.)

The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichés) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife’s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.

The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo’s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.

The president in August called the opioid crisis a “national emergency.” But he did not sign a formal declaration designating it as such, allowing the prospect to languish amid resistance in his administration about making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with a crisis that has shown no signs of abating. The crisis has claimed tens of thousands of lives — a death rate that one administration official noted Thursday rivals the number of Americans killed during the Vietnam War.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is not clear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out, including a drug czar to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of Health and Human Services who would tailor policies and identify funding streams.

Representative Tom Marino, the Pennsylvania Republican whom Mr. Trump had named to head his Office of National Drug Control Policy, withdrew last week after reports that he did the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in weakening law enforcement’s ability to curb drug sales in efforts to block black-market sales of opioids. The White House has yet to announce a new candidate.

And Tom Price resigned last month as health secretary after it was revealed he was flying on private jets paid for with taxpayer dollars; a nominee has not been named for that post either.

But proponents, including some anti-addiction groups and physicians, argue Mr. Trump’s action is an important symbolic step that would raise awareness and spark a new sense of urgency to deal with the opioid scourge.

The administration officials said a public health emergency declaration would quickly lead to crucial changes, including the potential to secure federal grant money and the expansion of access to telemedicine services, which would broaden the reach of medical treatment to rural areas ravaged by opioid use and where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump’s promises to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year.

As president, he formed an opioid commission in March and installed at the helm Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race. In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have prompted the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump has chosen.

Mr. Price had ruled out the idea of a national emergency, in part because of concerns about the potentially exorbitant costs to the federal government. Still, Mr. Trump surprised his advisers by telling reporters soon after his commission’s report that he was ready to take just such a step.

There have been few major actions to match those words, even as administration officials have worked feverishly behind the scenes to come to agreement on an opioid policy that would reflect the president’s position.

In the meantime, members of Mr. Trump’s opioid commission and lawmakers in both parties had grown impatient for action. On Wednesday, a group of Democrats led by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan released a letter they wrote to the president asking him to allow the government to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Declaring a state of emergency would give the secretary of Health and Human Services the power to seek such price reductions, they said.

Mr. Christie commended the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.",Trump to Declare Opioid Crisis a ‘Public Health Emergency’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

What this tells us is that we are all related to one another through a system of genetic lineage that almost no one understood until recently. These genetic kinship circles are expanding and connecting us through networks of recessive, dominant and autosomal genes; mitochondrial DNA; and complex interactions with the environment that shape how genes express themselves as we develop. Medical science has discovered more than 7,000 genetic diseases, and new ones emerge every day.

People in my world of disability pride and advocacy sometimes call themselves by tribal names such as “a thalidomide” or “a polio” or even “crips.” Our new genetic identities now yield more complex affinities. Rare genetic conditions are also called “orphan diseases.” Now that I have an orphan disease instead of a birth defect, I’m no longer an orphan but instead newly a member of several distinctive tribes, a heretofore hidden web of kinship and clan affiliations. Resemblances are crucial to kinship, whether familial, tribal or ethnic. What we look like tells us and other people to whom we belong. Our distinctive traits gather us in kinship networks that often provide us with alternative families of mutual care and support.

In a recent conversation about Crispr, the newest genetic editing tool, the geneticist and Nobel laureate Mario R. Capecchi told me, “The purpose of evolution is to anticipate the unexpected.” Random genetic variation is what moves evolution forward, yielding new forms that are fresh solutions to changing environments both natural and human designed.

The short span of human life and imagination limits our capacities to anticipate the unexpected. Ways of being that meet the demands of human life as we live it here and now may not serve our distant descendants so well. Characteristics we think of as intelligence, strength, vision, uprightness, dexterity, body mass or whiteness will outlive their usefulness, morphing from advantages to disadvantages, counterintuitive though that seems today, especially perhaps to those who have those valued traits and benefit from them.

Capecchi’s framing of evolution’s purpose as anticipating the unexpected can give us progressive perceptions about living with disabilities and stand as a caution against hubris and narcissism in our aspirations to shape our human communities according to the traits valued by the majority.

People with disabilities are the unexpected made flesh. The challenges of living in a world not built for us are occasions for resourcefulness and adaptability, especially for those of us who start out disabled early in life. We are innovators, early adopters, expert users and technology hackers as we respond to the adversity that the built and natural environments present us.

We don’t know which human variations will be advantages and which will be disadvantages in the long arc of our struggle to prevail in an ever-changing environment. My blind friend with excellent orientation skills quips that she will be leading all of us out of burning buildings and planes when the lights go out. My deaf friends avoid the stress of noise pollution and the exhaustion of talking over the incessant din in fashionable bars in which social and professional life takes place now. Another friend, who is a small person, remarks that he consumes fewer resources and fits better into airplane spaces than big guys good at fighting and football. Some people with autism have a capacity to focus that boosts creativity. Expertise at composing with my voice instead of clunky keyboards puts me ahead in new communication technology.

The bright line between the healthy and the diseased, those who “have” a disease and those that don’t, grows dimmer every day. Each of us carries within us many “orphan diseases” — that faintly Dickensian phrase that typically severs the connection between people like me and the human family of ordinary people. All of us are anything but “orphans.” Instead, we are all second or third cousins, inextricably linked through a chain of quickly vanishing ancestors and descendants. We are all patients-in-waiting, bound together on a wait list of inheritance hidden deep in the elegant whirls of that double helix in every one of our cells — silently paused in its inscrutable determination to shape our lives. All those clichés of connectedness are now encoded in our genes. The human community is quite literally the human family.

[ Read our refresher on where “Stranger Things” Season 1 left off. ]","The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first season’s conflicts. Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.

Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will’s D&D buddies — Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) — find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine’s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).

The new season’s biggest strength is how it deals with Will’s trauma. He’s a frail kid who’s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn’t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show’s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder’s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.

For a breakout hit, “Stranger Things 2” mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show’s teen characters for much of the season), but they’re grounded in the story and characters.

And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown’s transfixing stare, into “The Eleven Show.”

“Stranger Things” has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyce’s amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates. Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though it’s made out of movies. Parts of the new season recall “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Gremlins,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and, naturally, the Reese’s Pieces sequence in “E.T.” For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes “The Outsiders,” complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.

When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there’s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of ’80s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. “No one wants to be Winston!” he says. “He joined the team super late, he’s not funny and he’s not even a scientist.”

The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he’s made up a story. “I really liked it,” she says. “I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.”

I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.

But it’s a still a good time, it’s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of ’80s horror with the heart of an ’80s teen romance. It may be last year’s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn’t mean it can’t still be sweet.

But the hardest decisions on how to mitigate the costs of the proposal have yet to be made.

The blueprint, as unveiled, would cost the Treasury more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to estimates by tax-writing experts. Now Congress must find a way to force those proposals into a $1.5 trillion budget hole.

Disagreements on how to do that have begun spilling into public view. In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, Mr. Trump and the House’s chief tax writer, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate issue.

Republicans hope that by the end of the year, they will be able to deliver to Mr. Trump the first significant revamping of the tax code since the Reagan administration, a feat that would show that unified Republican government can take on a big challenge and produce success.

But overhauling the tax code is an exceedingly difficult task, as evidenced by the decades that have passed since it was last achieved. And in the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Republican lawmakers already failed in their long-promised quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, an outcome that makes the tax effort even more critical to the party’s fortunes.

The budget resolution approved Thursday, for the 2018 fiscal year, ostensibly maps out spending and revenue levels for the federal government. But its passage is meaningful largely because of the special procedures that it unlocks.

The budget measure contains parliamentary language that will shield a tax bill from a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, allowing it to pass with the approval of only 50 senators in a chamber where Republicans hold 52 seats. It also could pave the way for lawmakers to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.

In order to allow the tax effort to move along quickly, Republicans in the House agreed to pass the budget plan that the Senate approved last week.

The House had passed its own budget measure earlier this month, but by agreeing to the Senate plan rather than trying to meld the two documents, the timeline for passing a tax measure can be sped up.

In the end, the eagerness to tackle the tax overhaul ended up trumping other matters — including fiscal concerns that have been a central issue for many conservative Republicans.

For one thing, the House’s previous budget blueprint would have called for a more aggressive approach on cutting spending. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with legislation that would produce about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome.

But she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“Put simply, we have the opportunity to make history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three decades,” she said. “President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly.”

Democrats continued their drumbeat against the tax effort, warning that Republicans were preparing to cut taxes for the rich.

Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the budget measure was “not a real effort at responsible budgeting.”

Under the law, insurers will still have to provide the discounts, known as cost-sharing reductions, but may be unable to collect reimbursement from the government.

Mr. Trump ordered federal officials two weeks ago to stop making the monthly payments. Another federal district judge, in Washington, ruled in 2016 that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress had never appropriated money for them.

On Wednesday, Judge Chhabria concluded that “both sides have reasonable arguments’’ on the main legal question: Whether Congress appropriated money for the cost-sharing payments.

Two senior senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, announced last week that they had agreed on a bill to extend the cost-sharing payments through 2019 and make it easier for states to obtain waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act. After initially endorsing the deal, Mr. Trump backed off a day later, and the White House demanded changes as a condition of its support.

The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the Alexander-Murray bill would produce a modest reduction in federal budget deficits, but would not substantially change the number of people with coverage.

The budget office estimated that the legislation would reduce deficits by a total of $3.8 billion over the next decade. With the deficit for the last fiscal year alone reaching $666 billion, that is a relatively small number, but supporters of the bill made the most of it.

“The Congressional Budget Office has found that our proposal benefits taxpayers, it benefits consumers — not insurance companies,” said Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee.

The proposal has broad support from Democratic senators and at least a dozen Republican senators. But conservative Republicans in the House and the Senate have denounced it as a bailout for insurers, and Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he supports it. Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, called the measure “a nonstarter.”

The budget office said that continuing the cost-sharing payments would not change its estimate of federal spending because it had already assumed that the government would pay the subsidies: $9 billion a year in 2018 and 2019, and a total of $99 billion from 2018 to 2027.

The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a new version of the HealthCare.gov website showing premiums and other details of health insurance plans that will be offered for sale in the open enrollment period that starts next week.

In many markets, consumers will have few choices and will see high sticker prices before taking account of financial assistance for which they may qualify. But by carefully shopping around, consumers will often be able to find bargains — a point highlighted in the case in California, where the state runs its own marketplace.

During Monday’s hearing, state officials told Judge Chhabria that cutting off the subsidy payments would cause immediate and irreparable harm to states and to consumers, increasing the likelihood that insurers would pull out of the marketplace.

But Judge Chhabria said California and most of the other state plaintiffs “saw the writing on the wall a long time ago — that the administration was going to terminate these payments to insurance companies to subsidize co-payments and deductibles.”

“California is doing a really good job of responding to the termination of these payments in a way that is not only avoiding harm for people, but actually benefiting people,” the judge added.

In his Wednesday ruling, Judge Chhabria wrote that low-income people who now have silver plans in some cases may be able to find gold plans with lower premiums and lower deductibles for 2018.

To offset the expected loss of cost-sharing subsidies, California added a surcharge to the price of midlevel silver plans sold on its Affordable Care Act marketplace. When premiums go up, consumers receive more financial assistance to help with premium costs, so in many cases they will be no worse off.

“Nearly four out of five consumers will see their premiums stay the same or decrease, since the amount of financial help they receive will also rise,” California’s insurance marketplace announced earlier this month. In addition, it said, three-fourths of consumers in the state who are eligible for assistance will be able to buy low-cost bronze health plans next year for less than $10 a month.

“The state of California is standing on the courthouse steps denouncing the president for taking away people’s health care,” Judge Chhabria said at Monday’s hearing, “when the truth is that California has come up with a solution to that issue that is going to result in better health care for a lot of people.”

Many other states have taken similar steps to minimize harm to consumers, the judge said.

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The political journalist Mark Halperin built an industry on tracking the fortunes of the flawed characters he followed through campaign seasons. He gleefully chronicled who was up and who was down in his best-selling books and television coverage and made himself into one of the most prominent and most highly remunerated journalists in the country.

The drama and intrigue came to him on Wednesday night, when CNN posted a detailed report that he had sexually harassed women years ago, when he worked as the director of political coverage at ABC News. The CNN report included interviews with five women it did not identify who said that Mr. Halperin had made unwanted sexual advances against them.

On Thursday morning, MSNBC, the cable network where he is a political analyst and appears frequently on the influential show “Morning Joe,” announced that he would no longer be a contributor.

In a statement, an MSNBC spokesman said, “We find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.”

Benda excoriated them for “the intellectual organization of political hatreds.” He condemned them for worshiping a “cult of success,” which “says that when a will is successful that fact alone gives it a moral value, whereas the will which fails is for that reason alone deserving of contempt.”

He warned, prophetically, that this “great betrayal” of their philosophical vocation, along with their “desire to abase the values of knowledge before the values of action” had put mankind on the road to “the greatest and most perfect war ever seen in the world.”

Benda is often celebrated by conservative writers for his understanding of how prone intellectuals can be to fatal political misjudgments. Think of Michel Foucault’s embrace of Ayatollah Khomeini, Noam Chomsky’s excuses for the Khmer Rouge, or Naomi Klein’s effusions for Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. The list of intellectuals making fools of themselves is long.

So where are Benda’s conservative disciples today, the ones I remember from panel discussions on the importance of moral character, the dangers of relativism, or the post-modern assault on the concept of truth?

Their chief argument for Trump is that he won and is therefore a winner. Their argument against Never Trumpers is that we failed and are therefore losers. What about Trump’s character? It doesn’t matter so long as the Supreme Court remains conservative. Legislative failures are always and only the fault of “establishment Republicans.” Boorish habits are merely a matter of taste and something of a virtue in the era of snowflakes. As for the criticisms from Flake, Bush, Corker and McCain, who needs moral instruction from those sore losers and political has-beens?

Most telling is the Trumpians’ inability ever to utter a whisper of criticism of their man. Even Never Trumpers will occasionally find themselves agreeing with the administration over one issue or another. Not so the Trumpians. With instincts that recall the Stalinist intelligentsia of the 1940s, they mix the logical elasticity of the sophist with the unflinching loyalty of the toady. They are never anything except always all in.

All this suggests that what the media now trumpets as a looming G.O.P. civil war isn’t going to happen. Corker and Flake aren’t stepping up; they’re bowing out. Political retirees are good for leading charities, not movements.

As for the rest of the conservative movement, through its liaison with Trump it is participating in its own moral degradation in much the same way that Xaviera Hollander — a Dutch consular secretary who realized she could make a much better living as a call girl and brothel operator — became the notorious “Happy Hooker” of the 1970s. Shameless, yes. Criminal, also. But a runaway success all the same, with a memoir that sold north of 15 million copies and a movie about her starring Lynn Redgrave.

The default assumption of nearly every opponent of Donald Trump is that, sooner or later, he is bound to fail, either because he will be overwhelmed by events, undermined by scandal or abandoned by his own supporters.

So far, none of that has happened. In one key respect, he is the most successful president in modern times. He has ripped out the ideological foundations on which his party once stood. The Democratic Party was still recognizably itself after Bill Clinton left office. The G.O.P. will not be after Trump is done with it.

In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.
They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.
Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.
Still, she says, “I think it is a very good idea for the sake of the brain to be moving and active.”","Last year, in an important study published in NeuroImage, the researchers found for the first time that young brain cells in adult mice that spent a month with running wheels in their cages did seem to be different from those in animals that did not run. For the experiment, the scientists injected a modified rabies vaccine into the animals, where it entered the nervous system and brain. They then tracked and labeled connections between brain cells and learned that compared to the sedentary animals’ brain cells, the runners’ newborn neurons had more and longer dendrites, the snaky tendrils that help to connect the cells into the neural communications network. They also found that more of these connections led to portions of the brain that are important for spatial memory, which is our internal map of where we have been and how we got there.

This type of memory is often diminished in the early stages of dementia.

But these findings, while intriguing, involved animals that had been running for a month, which is the equivalent of years of physical activity by people. The researchers wondered whether such changes in neurons and connections might actually begin earlier and maybe almost immediately after the animals began to exercise.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Scientific Reports, most of the same researchers gathered a group of adult, male mice. (Males were used to avoid accounting for the effects of the female reproductive cycle.) The animals were injected with a substance that marks newborn neurons. Half were then allowed to run for a week on wheels in their cages, while the others remained inactive. Afterward, some were also injected with the modified rabies vaccine to track new synapses and connections between the neurons.

When the scientists then microscopically examined brain tissue, they found that the runners’ brains, as expected, teemed with far more new neurons than did the brains of the sedentary animals, even though the runners had been exercising for only a week.

Interestingly, these neurons also looked unique. They were larger and, as in the study of mice that ran for a month, displayed more and longer dendrites than similar neurons in the other animals. In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.

These young cells were better integrated into the overall brain circuitry, too, with more connections into portions of the brain involved in spatial and other types of memory. Most surprising to the scientists, these cells also proved to be less easily activated by neurochemical messages to fire rapidly, which is usually a hallmark of more mature neurons. They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.

What these differences in cell structure and connection mean for brain function remains uncertain, though, says Henriette van Praag, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health and senior author of this and the earlier study. Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.

But the current study “provides more pieces of evidence that brain cells produced under running conditions are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different” than other neurons, she says, “and these differences are evident very soon” after exercise begins.

Perhaps most important, the new brain cells in the runners tended to integrate into and bulk up portions of the brain that, if damaged by disease, are associated with early memory loss and dementia, she adds.

Of course, this experiment used mice, which are not people. While some past neurological studies with people have hinted that exercise might alter our brain structure in similar ways, she says, that possibility is still theoretical.

On a recent sunny afternoon, Mr. Panek was sitting in Tavern on the Green with Gus napping by his feet, cooling off after a six-mile jog around the Central Park loop.

“Gus sets the pace,” he said, “and I follow him.” Trotting at a nine-minute-mile clip, Gus, 5, is trained to avoid obstacles, slow down for congestion and, above all, keep Mr. Panek safe. Gus runs only when he feels confident there’s no danger, and he is trained to ignore commands that seem risky.

The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Wednesday that he had rebuffed a request for help last year from the head of a data firm that worked for Donald J. Trump and is now facing congressional scrutiny.

“I can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica,” Mr. Assange wrote, “and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.”

But The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Mr. Nix had emailed Mr. Assange looking for copies of more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton’s private server and never publicly released. Mrs. Clinton has said that the emails were personal in nature.

Trump, of course, spent much of his career pretending to be himself before the cameras. That’s the thing about reality TV — it’s actually happening, but you’re also making it up. Jeff Flake and his buddy were alone on the desert island with a camera crew. And, according to some reports, the producers decided who to fire on “The Apprentice.”

The president tends to be extremely agreeable when he’s playing chief executive at meetings. He had a gathering with Republicans to talk about tax cuts and received a standing ovation. “I called it a love fest,” Trump said later. This is the same guy who got along super-well with some Democratic senators at a dinner not too long ago. They discussed taxes, too, and agreed about everything.

But nothing’s necessarily going to last once people leave the room. This week Trump tweeted a denunciation of any Republican tax bill that would modify the popular 401(k) program, vowing, “There will be NO change to your 401(k).” On Wednesday he said it was something his party could use for “negotiating.”

This is a man whose strong suit is supposed to be deal making?

Early in this presidency, optimists believed that when Trump suddenly veered wildly from one position to another it was because of canny tactics. Now optimists believe that he’s just … really forgetful.

It’s tough, as everybody knows, to come to a bipartisan agreement on anything in Washington these days. Way harder than when Jeff Flake was trying to get milk from a coconut with Martin Heinrich. Now, if the two parties are ready to come together, they can’t be sure the president won’t rewrite the script and denounce them for betraying the middle class.

I know many of you are exhausted with the continuous wave of crazy-person stories pouring out of the White House. Perhaps you would feel better if you believed that Donald Trump does not so much lie as re-run reality on a different camera. He said this week that he was “extremely nice” to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, one of the four soldiers killed in Niger. Myeshia Johnson said that the president was unfeeling and appeared not to know her husband’s name.

Trump claimed he got all the names right because he has “one of the great memories of all time.” It is possible that’s the way he recalls the scene. In the real world, he seems to naturally say things that are off-kilter. And there are possibly days that he calls his oldest daughter “SriLanka.” Or “Mary Sue.”

Both feature Ms. Atwood’s unflinching eye on the constraints, social and literal, that have shackled women through history. As the stormy political climate continues to churn in the United States, the Canadian writer’s two decades-old novels have landed like contemporary critiques: In “Alias Grace,” 19th-century issues of anti-immigrant sentiment, abortion and class warfare seem suddenly hot-button.

“ ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ offers us a window into a possible future when women’s rights are eroded. ‘Alias Grace’ offers a look at what it was like before women had any rights,” said Ms. Polley. “To look back and forward is very important at this moment when women’s rights are incredibly precarious and fragile.”

Over breakfast in a restaurant near her home in Toronto last summer, Ms. Polley described how over the last two decades the character Grace never ceased burrowing in her imagination. Her 2012 autobiographical meta-documentary “Stories We Tell” opens with a quote from “Alias Grace,” read by Ms. Polley’s father. (“When you are in the middle of a story, it isn’t a story at all, but only a confusion,” it began.) That film, about Ms. Polley’s discovery of a family secret, confronted the unknowable, floating nature of family lore. Grace, in Ms. Atwood’s novel, is a shape-shifter, too, her guilt or innocence unfixed.

“To be a woman in that time, or any time, there are parts of your personality and responses to things that you’re expected to suppress,” said Ms. Polley. “So what happens to all that energy and all that anger? What do you do with powerlessness? The idea of having more than one identity, the face you show to the world and the face that’s deep within, captivated me.”

When the screen rights came up for grabs in 2012, Ms. Polley pounced. She took a six-hour meeting with Ms. Atwood. “She understood that the ambiguity mattered most, but ambiguity is tricky on film,” said Ms. Atwood. “Grace was convicted as an accessory because she didn’t tell. We never knew, and she never told. She acted as one of those blank screens onto which everybody commenting projected.” Ms. Atwood approved of the filmmaker’s ambiguity skills, and Ms. Polley paid out of pocket for the rights.

But the delays continued: Ms. Polley had a baby — and then another one. She wrote while her daughters napped, but was forced to shelve the pages when a fire extinguisher fell on her head at a community center, giving her a concussion. “My brain goes slower now, so maybe what I’m coming up with as a writer is richer,” said Ms. Polley. “Or maybe not. But I can’t multitask anymore, thank God.”

At first she tried to adapt it as a feature film, but not wanting to lose the book’s density she decided on a mini-series. And coming from the D.I.Y. trenches of independent film, Ms. Polley didn’t realize that for TV, she could have enlisted other writers to help with the scripts. Instead, she wrote all six episodes by herself and while doing so, decided not to direct. “I just couldn’t see it in my head,” she said. “There are scenes I wrote that I have no idea how to shoot. I love this book, and I was not going to see it screwed up, and I thought I might screw it up.”

Ms. Polley approached a director she admired, Mary Harron, who was working in TV (“Graceland,” “Constantine”). In film, Ms. Harron is known for period pieces, but not the corset kind, having directed blood-spattered cult favorites like “I Shot Andy Warhol” and “American Psycho.”

“No one else would’ve asked me to do this but Sarah Polley,” said Ms. Harron. “Both Sarah and I are interested in what is true and what is not true. I think she liked that a lot of my films have characters crossed with madness. And she knew I wouldn’t try to make ‘Downton Abbey.’ I didn’t want to prettify but to really show a brutal, ruthless, class-driven society.”

The CBC, Canada’s public broadcaster, came on board immediately, but a partner was needed to hit the $25 million (U.S.) budget. Netflix, the fast-growing streaming service that is increasingly looking at co-productions to fuel its insatiable appetite for original content, signed on quickly.

“They came in with a really clear vision and a lot of passion, and 500 pages written,” said Elizabeth Bradley, vice president of content at Netflix.

Last fall, “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Alias Grace” were being shot simultaneously in and around the city. In November, at the industrial Toronto waterfront that’s cluttered with film studios, Ms. Gadon and Edward Holcroft, who plays the young doctor trying to unearth Grace’s memories, were seated in the drawing room of a Victorian manor, their “session” bordering on flirtation. Rain began to slam the studio roof, interfering with sound recording. “We’re also under flight paths,” Ms. Polley sighed, sitting near the monitor.

Ms. Polley’s first feature, “Away from Her,” was an adaptation of a short story by Alice Munro, perhaps the only Canadian author more famous than Ms. Atwood. But Ms. Polley never met the reclusive Ms. Munro. In contrast, Ms. Atwood weighed in on scripts and casting for “Alias Grace,” and spent hours touring the detailed sets with the production designer. She especially liked the “botulistic preserves” in Mason jars in the basement cellar where the bodies were found.

As “Alias Grace” was shot through the election of President Trump, certain of the show’s themes gained new resonance, particularly abortion (the reality of illegal procurement is bluntly depicted) and immigration (Ms. Polley wrote Grace’s harsh crossing from Ireland with recent migrant crises in mind). When I spoke to Ms. Atwood this month, the House of Representatives had just passed a bill banning late-term abortions, and the Trump administration had moved to expand the rights of employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception.

“We are at a moment in history when some parts of North America are trying to turn the clock back, and if they want to turn it back, what do they want to turn it back to?” Ms. Atwood said. “There’s a reason the women’s movement really started in the 19th century. If they do go back, they’ll end up with [a woman] dying on a bloody mattress.”

Viewers in Canada, where “Alias Grace” began airing in late September, have responded. The ratings for the first episode were the strongest fall debut for a CBC drama in the past five years.

Ms. Atwood said she has “at least two more” books in development for TV. (“We will not talk about them until they’re real.”) The flip side of celebrity is increased scrutiny, and even the most woke star is sometimes considered not woke enough. Ms. Atwood was recently criticized in the Toronto news media for Nimby-ism after joining her neighbors in petitioning city officials to revise plans for an eight-story condo development that, Ms. Atwood wrote in a letter, might affect privacy and trees shared along the lot line. She was not surprised. “I’ve said to people over the years, ‘You’ve just had big success, get ready for three nasty vicious personal attacks.’ ”

Ms. Polley, too, has felt the sting of backlash. She hasn’t directed in five years or appeared in a film since 2010, choosing to spend time with her children and work selectively. But with so few female directors in the marketplace, she’s conscious that some view her stepping back as an act of betrayal. At a party, Ms. Polley mentioned to a female critic that she was parenting, not directing, and the woman made a vomiting noise at her. “The choice I made freely is, I would like to be with my children as much as possible. I think it’s a victory of feminism not a failure,” she said.

The hunger for Ms. Polley’s return now, fair or not, may also stem from her engagement in the past with prickly social issues that remain unresolved. She’s spoken out about rampant sexism on film sets, and against child acting (“We’ve eliminated child labor everywhere in society except film. Kids shouldn’t be in any environment that’s for profit”). In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations, she wrote an op-ed in this paper. In it, Ms. Polley recollected that at age 19, as a young actress, Mr. Weinstein offered her what he described as a “very close relationship,” noting how such relationships had benefited other actresses. Ms. Polley walked away.

“I got off totally easy,” she said. “There wasn’t a moment before this one where anyone would have cared about what those women had to say, where those women wouldn’t have been ridiculed for coming forward, where they wouldn’t have been thought of as whiners or strident or angry.”.

Then she returned to Ms. Atwood’s words about a denigrated Victorian housemaid, maybe framed for murder, or maybe pushed to it. “There’s a line where Dr. Jordan says something like: ‘I wonder how much sublimated rage she must have carried with her, this child harassed on every corner.’ And I wonder, too. I don’t just wonder about a domestic servant in the 1800s. I wonder about women in every single field, every single day.”","‘Alias Grace’: 20 Years in the Making, but on TV at the Right Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/television/alias-grace-margaret-atwood-sarah-polley.html

Half of them seemed to be trying to describe the experience in the most unpleasant terms possible, while the other half was looking for something nice to say. The first group appeared to have the easier job. Even Jonathan Gold of The Los Angeles Times, who named Vespertine the city’s best restaurant this week, acknowledged that the experience “is going to drive many of you insane.”

Anybody inclined to paint the restaurant as a steaming pile of pretentious nonsense will find that Jordan Kahn, Vespertine’s chef and overall impresario, is standing there with an open paint bucket and a brush. Vespertine is dedicated to “exploring a dimension of cuisine that is neither rooted in tradition nor culture,” a press release read. “It is a spirit that exists between worlds.” To Marian Bull of GQ, he described the building, one of several the architect Eric Owen Moss has designed in this low-rise district of vintage studio lots and start-ups, as “a machine artifact from an extraterrestrial planet that was left here like a billion years ago by a species that were moon worshippers.”

I spent most of an evening in that building and I still have no idea what he was talking about. The servers acted less like ancient space aliens than like monks running a monastic retreat for stressed-out nonbelievers. They glided around in black slippers and flowing black tunics, quiet as ninjas. When they were not going up the staircase to the third-floor kitchen or depositing food arrangements on the acrylic tabletops with a semi-explanatory murmur (“giant kelp with whipped honey and yuzu emulsion”), they stood motionlessly off to the side, looking either at the horizon or at the wall.

When he defines the cooking as rootless, Mr. Kahn is on more solid footing. Early in his career he worked in the pastry kitchens of Per Se and Alinea, so he knows how to take pains. A great deal of the pains he takes at Vespertine seem to go into making the food look like something other than food.

That, at least, is how it struck me after one meal at this “gastronomical experiment,” as the website has it. Writing up my preliminary impressions seems more appropriate than a full starred review for a work that is explicitly, intentionally in progress, one whose aim is to do something restaurants haven’t done before. Never mind that this has been the aim of a small parade of restaurants from El Bullí on, and that Vespertine falls right in step with that parade, however much it may pretend to have sprung from a fallen spore from another galaxy.

The first dish of the night seemed to be a sequined branch on an inclined black tortilla. The tortilla was a clay plate made, like many of the serving pieces, by a local sculptor named Robert Boldz. The branch was a water spinach stem brushed with turkey emulsion and bedazzled with little yellow pike eggs, tiny finger-lime orbs, pink and purple flowers the size of shirt-collar buttons, and whatnot. I like salads flavored with poultry juices, and I liked this.

Next came what I thought of as A Wheel Inside a Wheel, a wide looping belt of kelp stuck with blots of lovage sauce to the inside of a black ceramic hoop. There was a bloop of whipped honey inside the hoop, too. I stared, looking for a way in, until a server said, “You can think of it as chips and dip.” Oh, of course.

Some courses were almost inviting. Others seemed determined not to be eaten at all, like the C-curve of black wafer pressed into a C-curve of black ceramic. It wasn’t at all clear which part was supposed to go in my mouth. I gambled on the wafer, which was a crumbly savory cookie made from black currants and dried onions and brushed with black currant jam.

It went on from there, the portions growing slightly more substantial. Nothing tasted as weird as it looked. For this I was grateful. Nearly every dish tasted good, in one way or another, although more than one juxtaposed something unquestionably delicious with other things that turned up empty-handed to the flavor party: wonderful lobster in a bittersweet sauce of malted barley syrup and butter with a dull white spill of tapioca; exceptional brined scallop, sauced with yuzu and a tea made from Douglas fir tips, with unexciting ovals of white asparagus standing up like marble headstones in a cemetery.

Mr. Kahn has strong ideas about Vespertine’s food, but in these early months his interests seem predominantly visual. Drinking the juice pairing, I was amazed to realize that each of my drinks looked like my companion’s wines or beers; the ruby tone of his pinot noir nearly matched that of my beet and rose-hip juice. Our pairings converged at one point, a tea made from flowers of the butterfly pea plant. Its flavor was flat, almost imperceptible, but its color was a profound blue almost never seen at the dinner table.

Heightened attention to visuals is routine for chefs these days, when a pretty food picture can rocket around the world in minutes. This is not Mr. Kahn’s game. Certain Vespertine dishes are virtually unphotographable by design. The caramelized lobster, for instance, is squirreled away inside a black ceramic globe. A small opening lets in almost no light.

He isn’t trying to dress up his cooking so much as he’s trying to wrestle it away from familiarity. He certainly uses flowers for their colors — none of them tasted like much — but the blossoms he chooses are not normal restaurant ingredients. Gardeners may spot sweet alyssum, passionflower and yarrow, but others probably won’t.

The urge to make food unrecognizable as food has been going strong since the rise of Ferran Adrià, whose lasting legacy is his emphasis on transforming ingredients into unfamiliar shapes and states. Some chefs who followed Mr. Adrià’s plunge into the weird, such as Grant Achatz and Wylie Dufresne, often combined flavors in ways that were immediately recognizable, even if the shapes were new. The taste of pastrami and rye at Mr. Dufresne’s WD-50, or birthday cake at Mr. Achatz’s Alinea, provided a sensory thread back to the known world.

Mr. Kahn’s innovation is to cut that thread. The rhubarb compote he serves with heirloom turkey may or may not be an analogue for cranberries, but in general he faithfully carries out his promise to uproot Vespertine’s cooking from tradition and culture. You’re not meant to know what you’re eating, which may be why the servers’ monkish murmurs cover just a fraction of what they are depositing in front of you.

This would be all right if the flavors made as strong an impression as the shapes they’d taken. But I remember the way my meal looked much more vividly than how it tasted. Mr. Kahn is letting his gifts as a sculptor and colorist, which are real, get the upper hand.

For the first two hours or so, Vespertine had me going. The music, by the Texas ambient outfit This Will Destroy You, made me slow down and listen for small shifts and surprise harmonies. (Five recordings of violas, guitars, synthesizers, xylophones and music boxes, among other instruments, play in different parts of the restaurant, composed in relative keys so they mesh together when you hear more than one at a time.) I appreciated the way the murmuring monks, instead of telling me how “Chef” wanted the food to enter my body, left me to puzzle it out on my own. And up to a point, I enjoyed solving those puzzles.

Before dinner ended, though, I’d had enough. If I hadn’t been guilted into paying $30 in advance for after-dinner drinks in the garden by an unsubtle poke from the ticketing website (“We ask that all guests participate”), I would have called for the car.

Another Adrià legacy is the idea that creativity in cooking means a sharp break with the past. Mr. Achatz picked up on this when he named his restaurant Alinea, after the medieval symbol marking a new paragraph — a new line of thought.

I have never seen a restaurant try as hard as Vespertine to erase everything that came before. While I was eating there I didn’t miss the good old earth, but I did think that Mr. Kahn’s new planet needed a few more signs of life.

Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia). In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people.

“This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything,” said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper. “The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.”

Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage. The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull.

After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.

Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.

Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.

They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.

The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. “Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’” said Dr. Goff.

More Reporting on Archaeology

He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. “Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.”

Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.

But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.

Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.

“Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,” he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. “Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.”

The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.

“When advertisers understand that we have approximately 1.6 million people every single day through the system — it’s a fabulous place to advertise,” Mr. Lhota said.

Effective immediately, the agency will no longer accept new alcohol-related ads; existing contracts for such ads will be honored until the contracts expire at the end of the year.

Mr. Hibbard said the majority of the American population, about 71.6 percent, was above the legal drinking age. Parents, not advertisements, are the greatest influence on preventing underage drinking, he said.

“This is not advertising on school buses,” Mr. Hibbard said. “This is advertising on a public transportation system.”

The board is still discussing how the measure will affect the partnerships it has with Connecticut on Metro-North Railroad trains, and with New Jersey on New Jersey Transit.

Already, in the high-profile campaigns of 2017 — governor races in Virginia and New Jersey and a special Senate race in Alabama — Republican candidates are mirroring Mr. Trump’s racially tinged campaign tactics. And Republican officials are putting up with the sort of incendiary candidacy that a party more devoted to nurturing a tolerant image might have rejected.

The reason? Many of their voters prefer the Trump way.

“We’re not an element,” said Laura Ingraham, a pro-Trump talk show host. “We’re the party.”

Ms. Ingraham, the author of a new book, “Billionaire at the Barricades,” on the populist uprising that helped elect Mr. Trump, said the conservatism of market-oriented internationalism simply has little mass appeal.

“There’s no constituency for open borders, endless war and these international trade deals that are skewed against the United States,” she said.

As for the limited government pitch that defined Mr. Flake’s career, Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, scoffed.

“This thing they’ve got today doesn’t work, it doesn’t move with urgency,” said Mr. Bannon, who is now orchestrating an effort to defeat Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump’s agenda. “It’s very nice. But it’s a theoretical exercise. It can’t win national elections.”

Even some of the president’s detractors on the right believe that the party base will stick with him because they like his agenda.

“We have a leader who has a personality disorder,” said former Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, “but he’s done what he actually told the people he was going to do, and they’re not going to abandon him.”

This grass-roots loyalty is why no prominent Republicans on the ballot next year have broken with Mr. Trump — only lame-duck lawmakers and Republicans out of office, such as former President George W. Bush, have been harshly critical of him.

At the moment, congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are trying to make common cause of an overhaul of the tax code because they see it as something of a temporary cure-all. A bill-signing ceremony on taxes would hand lawmakers something to run on next year and the president a much-needed accomplishment.

“It stops the bleeding,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina.

But even that holds risks. A tax cut that skews heavily toward corporations and the rich would hardly dislodge the populist view of a Republican establishment beholden to its donors.

“I don’t think the rank-and-file Republican believes that corporations are people,” said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to the Trump campaign who has also worked with Mr. Bannon. He was mimicking a Mitt Romney quote that earned Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, ridicule for being out of touch.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump painted a rosy picture of the party.

“We have, actually, great unity in the Republican Party,” he told reporters before leaving for a fund-raiser in Texas.

But even as Mr. Trump won repeated standing ovations from Senate Republicans on Tuesday when he visited their weekly lunch at the Capitol, the party’s lingering tensions were also on display. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, a longtime member of the Agriculture Committee, expressed concern about whether Mr. Trump would pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Republican present at the luncheon.

How aggressively the president pursues his platform on trade and immigration restrictionism could test how strong his grip is on Congress.

For now, though, the vision for a more populist-nationalist party sketched out by Mr. Bannon is being won as much through intimidation as through actual purges in Republican primaries.

What Mr. Bannon is trying to do — and what Mr. Flake’s retirement could further — is strike fear in the hearts of Republicans who do not display enough enthusiasm for the nationalism that Mr. Trump ran on.

“This should be a warning shot to any other ‘Never Trumper’ in the Senate today: Your time is up,” Mr. Surabian said.

That is playing out not only in the examples of Mr. Flake and Mr. Corker.

In Nevada and Mississippi, Senators Dean Heller and Roger Wicker have responded to Trump-inspired primary threats by taking steps to emphasize their fealty to Mr. Trump.

On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, endorsed former Judge Roy S. Moore in the Alabama Senate race, praising Mr. Moore, a caustic social conservative, as “a tireless advocate led by principle rather than politics.” Mr. Cornyn is the highest ranking Republican to formally back Mr. Moore.

But accommodation is not giving pause to would-be rivals. Danny Tarkanian, Mr. Heller’s Republican challenger, said the conversation among activists was no longer dominated by finding the most conservative candidates.

“The talk I hear is, ‘Hey, who’s going to support Trump’s “America First” policies,’” said Mr. Tarkanian, citing trade, military intervention and what he described as “worrying more about refugees from other countries than our own people.”

In the House, some lawmakers who have previously spoken out against Mr. Trump, such as Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, are now working to repair their relationship with the White House.

“The message they’re sending is: The way to survive is by accommodating him, changing their tone and professing loyalty to Trump,” said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard and a vociferous Trump critic.

The two governor’s races this year also illustrate Mr. Trump’s influence in the party. In Virginia and New Jersey, the establishment-aligned Republican nominees for governor, Ed Gillespie and Kim Guadagno, are airing controversial ads on immigration to both stir their base and win over some independents concerned about crimes committed by those in the country illegally. Mr. Gillespie, a veteran Washington lobbyist who served in George W. Bush’s White House, is also running ads extolling his support for Confederate statues.

In the Senate, Republicans have made clear that they will welcome Mr. Moore of Alabama — who has a decades-long history of making inflammatory comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims — to their ranks should he win the special election in December to fill the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. A handful of conservative writers have expressed concern about the message that tolerating Mr. Moore sends, but no high-profile lawmaker has followed suit, and a pair of Republican senators are even hosting a fund-raiser for him next month in Washington.

And in Colorado, former Representative Tom Tancredo, who was shunned by the Bush-era Republican Party for his harsh anti-immigration views, is considering a comeback bid for governor in 2018.

Whether Mr. Trump permanently realigns the party around his style and platform may depend on how much he remains true to what could be called Trumpism.

Mr. Graham believes that the president is not as wedded to some of his nationalist policies as his supporters want to believe.

“The best thing that could happen to Trump and the future of the Republican Party is for Trump to fix a broken immigration system,” Mr. Graham said.

By calling last week to offer his support to a handful of Republican senators that Mr. Bannon had named as potential targets, the president demonstrated he would not blindly follow his former adviser.

Establishment Republicans are attempting to convince Mr. Trump that “if you join with Bannon, you cut your own throat,” Mr. Graham said, because it could lead to an impeachment effort by a Democratic-controlled Congress.

But these arguments cause the early Trump enthusiasts only to roll their eyes. The party establishment, these Trump backers say, wants to govern as if the election never happened.

“They still think the election was about Trump’s personality,” Ms. Ingraham said. “It wasn’t. It was his ideas.”","As G.O.P. Bends Toward Trump, Critics Either Give In or Give Up",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/trump-republican-party-critics.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

You’d be surprised how often identity theft comes down to misplaced or stolen documents. A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.

The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.

Wirecutter recommends the Amazon Basics 12-Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder, which can also handle CDs and old credit cards.

Tools to Keep Those Cables Under Control

Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They’re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.

Wirecutter’s favorites — and mine — are Velcro One Wrap Thin Ties. A pack of 100 is only $10, and you can reuse them over and over.

And while you’re getting all of those cables in order, also think about picking up an extra laptop charger and charging cable. The last thing you want is to get home, open your laptop to work and realize you forgot your charger at the office or in another room.

A Quality USB Headset

Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don’t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you’ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.

A Lap Desk, for Those Couch Working Sessions

I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that working from home sometimes means working in bed or working from the couch in front of the TV. (Call it an office perk.)

When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn’t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.

The problem is really with us.”Indeed, the Kennedy assassination has continued to intrigue and puzzle the American public long after most of the main players have died.
“We just have to realize that there is never going to be an explanation of the Kennedy assassination that will satisfy everyone,” Mr. Beschloss said.","The documents have either never been disclosed or been made public only in redacted form, and are due to be released by the National Archives and Records Administration on Thursday under a law passed in 1992 after the Oliver Stone movie “JFK” stoked interest in Kennedy-related conspiracies. The last of the documents were required to be released 25 years after the law was signed, but the incumbent president, in this case Mr. Trump, can order some withheld in response to concerns by the intelligence agencies. White House officials said he had not made up his mind whether to do so.

Historians and conspiracy investigators are eager to see what the documents may yet reveal about Lee Harvey Oswald and any ties he may have had to the Cubans, Soviets, C.I.A., F.B.I. or mafia. Some hope for a better understanding of Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban Consulate in the weeks before the assassination at Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.

Still, some specialists on the killing warned against expecting any stunning revelation. “I don’t think it will turn the case on its head,” said Gerald Posner, author of “Case Closed,” the 1993 book that concluded that Oswald indeed killed Kennedy on his own.

“We’re not going to find some secret memo from J. Edgar Hoover drawing out the escape path for Lee Harvey Oswald,” he said. “The public expectations are very high — they’ve heard about secret files, they know they’ve been locked up for all these years. The average person may think there’s a bombshell in there.”

But Mr. Posner said the files might draw a fuller picture of the early 1960s beyond the specific questions about the assassination. “This is all about the Cold War and spooks and spies and Mexico City,” he said. “This is about a time when we know the government was in league with the mob to kill Castro. Cold War scholars and historians may find this as interesting as Kennedy assassination researchers.”

According to the archives, 88 percent of the documents in the collection created by the 1992 law have been released in full and another 11 percent have been released with portions redacted. Just 1 percent have been withheld in full until now. Most have remained secret because they were declared “not assassination related” or “not believed relevant.” Officials said many of those were documents created as late as the 1990s to describe how intelligence collection worked.

Jefferson Morley, an author who spent years suing the C.I.A. for documents related to the Kennedy assassination, said he thought it likely that Mr. Trump would defer to some agency demands and withhold a portion of the archive. But he said he nonetheless hoped it would answer some questions for researchers that linger after nearly 54 years.

“There won’t be any smoking gun,” said Mr. Morley, editor of the assassination website JFKfacts.org, who re-examined the period for his new book, “The Ghost: The Secret Life of C.I.A. Spymaster James Jesus Angleton.” “But it will fill in the picture of the pre-assassination surveillance of Oswald,” especially during his visit to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City.

Mr. Morley said that the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. were well aware of Oswald, a former defector to the Soviet Union, before the killing. “The idea that Oswald came out of the blue and shot the president is false,” he said. “The C.I.A. had a deep file on him.”

Mr. Morley also said that with the potential release of what may total more than 100,000 pages, no one should expect instant answers on what they contained. “There will be good stuff in there, but you’re not going to find it in the first two hours,” he said.

He noted that while the documents have not been previously made public, they all were seen years ago by the J.F.K. Assassination Records Review Board and were unlikely to significantly affect the official story. He cautioned against conspiratorial thinking that runs against the evidence, which he finds persuasive, that Oswald alone killed Kennedy.

“I can understand why people are curious,” Mr. Holland said. “But the level of distrust in this country is such that people will believe anything. The problem is really with us.”

Indeed, the Kennedy assassination has continued to intrigue and puzzle the American public long after most of the main players have died. While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, most people have never accepted the official version of events. A poll by Gallup in 2013, at the time of the 50th anniversary, found that 61 percent of Americans still believed that others besides Oswald were involved — and that was the lowest percentage of skeptics found in nearly a half century.

Feeling anxious, Ms. Ramirez started smoking up to two packs a day. “I used to wake up smoking cigarettes,” she recalled. “Smoking made me calm.”

Ms. Ramirez had also experienced a long bout of grief. In one year, she had buried several close relatives who had contracted HIV from infected needles. “There were so many funerals,” she said. She lost five of her siblings in the space of a few years.

Ms. Ramirez was also a marijuana smoker, but she began increasingly using the drug by herself, multiple times a day. “I used to have to do it just to move around, cook, clean, to do whatever it was I wanted to do,” she said.

It took doctors two years to find a prescription that eased her schizophrenia symptoms without drastic side effects. During this time, she gained about 100 pounds, doubling her weight.

For about a decade, Ms. Ramirez has received mental health and wellness services through Brooklyn Community Services and its predecessor. When she started coming to the agency, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she often slept sprawled on a covered radiator by the window in the common area and did not socialize.

Outside the agency, she continued smoking marijuana. But Ms. Ramirez said she hated how people would look at her and comment on her red eyes and the stench of her clothes.

In 2010, she began an integrated dual disorder treatment program to combat her mental illness and her drug use.

“It was like coming out of a cloud,” Ms. Ramirez said of quitting marijuana. Over the years, she regained her senses of taste and smell, which had been dulled by smoking. “It was like I was waking up,” she added.

Within a few months of kicking her drug habit, she joined a weekly smoking-cessation group through Brooklyn Community Services. “I quit cold turkey,” she said. Most in the group used nicotine patches to transition, but not Ms. Ramirez. “I didn’t want to leave one addiction for another,” she said, adding: “I wanted to make that change. I was ready to make that change.”

Art therapy, offered by the organization, helped her through the withdrawal symptoms, she said. Ms. Ramirez, who had drawn since she was a teenager, took to the method quickly. And in 2012, the organization featured Ms. Ramirez’s pencil and ink drawings at its annual art show. Her series of bodiless faces in pinks, blues and grays depicted long lashes blooming from almond eyes, hairstyles of tight circles, the faces surrounded by hearts and cubes.

Her mother, Carmen Rivera, came to the show. “She said, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Ms. Gwinnell, the recovery specialist, recalled.

Ms. Ramirez is grateful, too. “Thank you for getting me back,” she told Ms. Gwinnell recently.

In May, Ms. Ramirez, a mother of three adult children, moved into a one-bedroom apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the first home she has had to herself since her diagnosis about 25 years ago. Ms. Ramirez receives monthly $735 in Social Security Income and $150 in food stamps and pays $162 in subsidized rent. In July, Brooklyn Community Services used $300 from the Neediest Cases Funds to buy her, among other household items, two sets of window curtains, a lamp and a shower curtain.

After living with family for so long, Ms. Ramirez said she particularly enjoyed having full rein over the kitchen. No longer the shadow on the radiator, she likes socializing and sharing favorite Puerto Rican dishes like fritters and flan with others at the organization.

Ms. Ramirez, who dropped out of school in 10th grade when she was pregnant with her first child, said she would like to earn her high school equivalency diploma. Having previously worked in fast food and other industries, she wants to pursue a career as a chef. She might also try to display her artwork in a neighborhood gallery.

But for now, she is focused on her health. About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services. She has not been hospitalized for over 10 years. In addition to drawing, she meditates frequently.

“You have to put your part in,” she said of remaining drug-free. “A miracle doesn’t just walk in the door. If you want to quit, you have to be understanding and compassionate with yourself.” Ms. Ramirez smiled. “Today,” she added, “I walked in with my health.”",‘Coming Out of a Cloud’ After Drug Abuse and Mental Illness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/nyregion/coming-out-of-a-cloud-after-drug-abuse-and-mental-illness.html

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect.
Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive.
“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”
