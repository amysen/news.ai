Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?

Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.

I’m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book ""Clinton Cash,"" by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.

A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.

In 2009, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license.

All of this was taking place after years of what could best be categorized as challenging times in U.S.-Russia relations, as Russia attempted to annex Georgia, intimidated Ukraine and threatened the former-captive nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia with short-range nuclear weapons. In short, Russia was doing nothing that would indicate it was a country unwilling to build and potentially use nuclear weapons; the signs of aggression were everywhere.

Now there is a process that the U.S. government uses to ensure that any business deal that may include significant national security issues is given serious, in-depth and careful review and approval. That review is run through the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CIFIUS), which includes representatives from Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Justice, and State, as well as the U.S. trade representative and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and National Security Council. In addition, the director of national intelligence also has input to the review.

CIFIUS and Congressional reviews killed deals like the Rosatom purchase before. In 2006 it helped kill the deal by a Dubai owned company to buy U.S. ports, in part because of the national security risks it presented, and it killed multiple deals with Chinese companies as well in 2009 and 2010. Yet, between the first week of August 2010 and October 22, 2010, the Obama Administration in expedited time approved the sale of crucial national security resources to Russia by rubber stamping the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom. In 2015, Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted the expedited time of the deal's approval in a letter to then Attorney General Loretta Lynch, calling it a deal that was ""apparently approved in record speed.""

According to most law firms that deal in such matters, CIFIUS reviews involving sensitive national security matters can take up to 120 days. The Rosatom deal took fewer than 90 days. More outrageous: it appears there were no Congressional oversight hearings. Even more outrageous – and puzzling – members of the CIFIUS review board were aware of attempts by Russian government efforts to bribe U.S.-based executives in the U.S. uranium industry at the time this deal was being approved.

This wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history.

On October 5th of 2010, Republicans in Congress demanded that the Obama Administration review the Rosatom deal more closely, citing a host of national security issues. For example, one rationale cited by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for approving the deal was that Rosatom did not have an export license to sell or ship the U.S. uranium overseas. But as the Congressional letter noted, Russia’s government-controlled nuclear companies had been sanctioned numerous times for breaking uranium import-export deals, particularly to the countries they aid in building nuclear capacity, such as Iran (yes, Rosatom helped build the Iranian Bushere nuclear plant and trained Iranian nuclear scientists). To paraphrase a pop culture reference Vladamir Putin would appreciate: “An export license? Russia doesn’t need a stinkin’ export license!”

Consider this: Russia got its generous foothold in the U.S. uranium market in less time than it takes most 16-year-olds to get a driver’s license. Russia got its deal moved through the Obama Administration faster than it took the Obama Administration Department of Justice’s Anti-Trust Division to approve any of the mergers of two U.S. companies it reviewed.

How is that possible? Clearly there were motivated folks to get the deal done. One of those was clearly Hillary Clinton, whose family foundation raked in millions from donors with ties to Russia, as well as the uranium industry. Some media outlets have pointed out that the total take for the foundation may have been as “little” as $4 million. But for a cash-starved foundation that can’t even afford to give back $250,000 from serial sex-offender Harvey Weinstein, $4 million is a decent cash reserve.

But let’s be clear, this wasn’t simply your typical Clinton back room deal. This was a deal that was reviewed by virtually every senior Obama administration official, many of whom were aware of the Clinton connection, the FBI bribery investigation, and Rosatom’s history. And let's not forget either: controlling the global supply chain is the very obvious goal of Putin's. To make matters worse, President Barack Obama reviewed the case.

Why would such a deal go through? Sometimes the easiest explanation is the right one: maybe it was nothing more than a payback to Democrat and Clinton donors. When nothing makes sense in Washington D.C., just follow the money.

While this scandal's original focus was on Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation, it goes far deeper into a Democratic administration than anyone within the party wants to admit. Which is perhaps why President Obama seemed less than excited about pushing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Perhaps in a rare moment of self-recollection and awareness, he realized that eventually the breadth of this story would end up exactly where we are today, with all eyes looking at Obama's appointees, wondering why they sold America’s national security for the uranium-market equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.",Hillary Clinton and the real Russian collusion,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/hillary-clinton-and-real-russian-collusion.html

In an interview with Slate, Bourdain claims his female friends in the restaurant world never thought to confide in him about any inappropriate behavior, which he sees as a “personal failing.”

“It’s like, wow, I’ve known some of these women and I’ve known women who’ve had stories like these for years and they’ve said nothing to me. What is wrong with me?” said Bourdain.

“How have I presented myself in such a way as to not give confidence, or why was I not the sort of person people would see as a natural ally here?” he added.

BOURDAIN REVEALS 'SHAMEFUL' FAST FOOD SECRET

Throughout the course of the interview, Bourdain repeatedly refers to his first book, “Kitchen Confidential,” a memoir about his time in the restaurant industry. After its release, Bourdain said he “happily played the role” of a bad-boy chef who used foul language and did “stupid offensive s---,” despite trying to distance himself from the persona later on.

“I’ve had to ask myself, and I have been for some time, “To what extent in that book did I provide validation to meatheads?”

Bourdain first responded to the allegations against the Besh Restaurant Group on Oct. 21, after the Times-Picayune reported that 25 women had come forward with claims of sexual harassment against male supervisors within the company, as well as Besh himself.

“The beginning of the end of institutionalized Meathead Culture in the restaurant business,” he wrote on Twitter.

Earlier that month, Bourdain also spoke out against Harvey Weinstein after his girlfriend, Italian actress Asia Argento, came forward with her own rape allegations against the Hollywood mogul.

Bourdain told Slate that his relationship with Argento is also what spurred him to speak out about the subject.

FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force located human remains at Cow Meadow Park in Freeport, its New York bureau announced on Wednesday. The FBI acted on a tip connected with the savage street gang MS-13 that led them to the remains, FOX5NY reported.

“FBI has no further comment at this time,” the bureau said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for Nassau County Police Department told Fox News it was assisting the FBI with the investigation. The FBI did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.

MS-13 SPREADING ACROSS US AS AG SESSIONS VOWS TO TAKE DOWN GANG

Residents who frequented the area said they were shocked about the gruesome discovery and said violence rarely occurred in the neighborhood.

“There’s been rumors circulating in the neighborhood that MS-13 was hanging out in the park. But we found it hard to believe,” a resident told FOX5NY.

Investigators also searched a wooded area in Massapequa on Wednesday, but the only discovery announced was the gruesome find in Freeport.

“We’ve been going to this park our whole life,” Adam LaMonica told Newsday. “There’s never any violence down here or anything. It’s very unusual for this part of Freeport.”

The discovery came just a week after 16-year-old Angel Soler’s body was discovered on the Baldwin-Roosevelt border. Soler, who vanished in July, was found dead after a “person of interest” gave Homeland Security Investigations a “detailed” tip about where the remains were.

WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

Sources told Newsday investigators believe MS-13 may have killed Soler. Nassau County police told Fox News they have not confirmed the death was gang-related and there’s an ongoing investigation into the case.

Soler’s mother, Suyapa Soler, also openly said she believed her son’s death was gang-related, but would not reveal what information led her to that conclusion or which gang may have been responsible.

It’s unclear if the remains are linked to Soler’s death at this time. Two of Soler’s good friends and classmates at Freeport High School, Kerin Pineda and Josue David Amaya, also disappeared in May and September 2016. Pineda’s mother, Lilian Olivia, told FOX5NY she ""fears the worst"" for her son and is worried when she hears a body is found that it will be Pineda.

The Bowling Green Daily News reports that Chevrolet will stop building the 2018 model on January 22 after a total of just four months of production.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

Prototypes of the vehicle have been spotted on the road, and it is expected to officially debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January.

The question is, what will be coming out of the factory when the plant starts building 2019 model year cars on January 29?

Chevy won’t comment, but along with the mid-engine coupes, a high performance version of the current Corvette has also been spotted being tested, so the front-engine version should live on for at least part of the year.

In response, one cheeky citizen took to Le Bon Coin, a Craigslist-type classified website, to post an ad for a small slice of baguette slathered in butter — known as a “tartine” — in an attempt capitalize on the demand.

“Tartine for sale covered in real half-salted (demi-sel) Breton butter, bought just a week ago. I stress that the tartine has been toasted, however I waited for it to cool before applying the butter,” the seller wrote in a post that has since gone viral, The Local reports.

He also priced the item at 5 euro, or just under $6.

While the seller later told France Radio that the ad was a joke simply meant to poke fun at the ongoing butter crisis, the dairy disaster is no laughing matter.

According to The Local, the trouble began in 2015 when the European Union abolished its system of milk quotas, ultimately leading to a decline in production that coincided with a rising demand for buttery baked goods from Europe across Asia and the Middle East.

The targeting scandal drew heavy attention in 2013 when the IRS admitted it applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups applying for nonprofit status.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced early Thursday that the Justice Department had entered into settlements with Tea Party groups whose tax-exempt status was significantly delayed by the IRS dating back to 2013, “based solely on their viewpoint or ideology.”

The settlements involve payments to the plaintiffs and an apology from the IRS.

The targeting scandal drew heavy attention in 2013 when the IRS admitted it applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups applying for nonprofit status. Lois Lerner, then head of the Exempt Organizations unit responsible, became the public face of the scandal, though other IRS officials were involved as well.

Sessions said that groups with names involving “Tea Party” or “Patriots,” or those with specific policy positions concerning government spending, were subject to “inappropriate criteria” to “screen” applications.

JUDGE ORDERS IRS TO REVEAL WHO TOOK PART IN TEA PARTY TARGETING

“The IRS’s use of these criteria as a basis for heightened scrutiny was wrong and should never have occurred,” Sessions said in a statement Thursday. “It is improper for the IRS to single out groups for different treatment based on their names or ideological positions.”

While the IRS did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment, court documents show that the agency did offer an apology.

“The IRS admits that its treatment of Plaintiffs during the tax-exempt determination process, including screening their applications based on their names or policy positions, subjecting those applications to heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays, and demanding some Plaintiffs’ information that TIGTA determined was unnecessary to the agency’s determination of their tax-exempt status, was wrong,” the IRS said in court documents. “For such treatment, the IRS expresses its sincere apology.”

The Justice Department’s settlement would pay the claims of each of the over 400 groups in the case. The attorneys for the groups said it was “a great day for the First Amendment,” but noted that day “was too long in coming.”

“The Government’s generous settlement with the Class Plaintiffs fully vindicates their claims that the IRS targeted Tea Party and conservative groups based on their viewpoint,” lead counsel for the conservative groups, Eddie Greim, told Fox News in an email. “However, like Lois Lerner’s stated apology back in 2013, any recent so-called 'apology' by the IRS has little value. That is because the Service continues to suggest that its targeting was really just ‘mismanagement.’”

Greim added: “This story was dismantled in our case.

How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug.

Reaching deep in their drawer of smug, CNN unleashed a “Facts First” initiative, starting with an ad featuring an apple, with a voice-over warning viewers that some awful, yet unnamed, person or network is trying to convince you the apple is a banana. While a juvenile attempt to discredit President Trump’s complaints about the network’s shoddy news coverage, they manage only to remind us of why they’re in this fix in the first place.

What CNN reveals with this abject sanctimony is their contempt for the viewers themselves. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana. They might scream banana, banana, banana, over and over and over again. They might put BANANA in all caps. You might even start to believe that this is a banana. But it’s not. This is an apple.” And then the words “Facts First” appear on screen.

This is 30 seconds of CNN condescendingly treating news consumers as idiots, unable to judge for themselves. Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.

Think about this: Someone at CNN thought it would be a great idea to suggest people who don’t trust CNN are either brainwashed or just plain stupid.

They must be feeling very, um, special right around now as sole possessors of the truth, as a Harris Poll in May found that 65 percent of voters feel that fake news in the mainstream news media is a big problem.

From May 2017, The Hill reported, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans say the mainstream press is full of fake news, a sentiment that is held by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum. According to data from the latest Harvard-Harris poll … 65 percent of voters believe there is a lot of fake news in the mainstream media. That number includes 80 percent of Republicans, 60 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats.”

And why might Americans (including the president) consider CNN fake news?

Consider some recent headlines: Huffington Post: “CNN mistakes sex toy flag for ISIS Flag at London gay pride.” Daily Mail: “CNN anchor mistakes Star-Spangled Banner for French national anthem.”

Federalist: “CNN producer fesses up: We’re just doing the Russia stuff for ratings.” Referring to the Project Veritas undercover video of a CNN producer, they reported, “When asked if he thought the Russia collusion story was legitimate or all hype, [John] Bonifield said it’s ‘mostly [expletive] right now.’

” ‘Like we don’t have any big giant proof,’ he said. ‘I think the president is probably right to say, like, “Look, you are witch-hunting me. You have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.” ‘ “

That looks an awful lot like a banana, no?

The New York Times referred to CNN as having a “unique role as nemesis for Mr. Trump.” Really? Also The New York Times: “3 CNN journalists resign after retracted story on Trump ally.” A story with three reporters and one anonymous source. When the target of the hit piece, Anthony Scaramucci, threatened to sue, only then did the network retract and apologize.

I guess that’s what happens when you’re an official “nemesis” — your prize is a basket full of bananas.

National Review: “CNN calls attacked Jerusalem synagogue a mosque; equates terrorists with victims.”

And let’s not forget CNN hunting down and threatening a person on Reddit who created an anti-CNN WrestleMania gif, featuring President Trump wrestling a man (with a CNN logo head) to the ground. Yes, it was funny because it was a joke. Then CNN went … bananas.

The Hill reported on CNN’s bizarre reaction about the hunt for the person who dared to make fun of the network: “He is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.” The story, titled “How CNN found the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF,” quotes from CNN.com: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.”

And that’s how #CNNBlackmail began to trend on Twitter. A senior reporter at Vox tweeted, “I can’t emphasize how bad this is on CNN’s part. This is basically ‘don’t post stuff we don’t like or we’ll dox you.’ Extremely unethical.” To say the least.

The Federalist reminds us of another CNN banana: “A banana is when you run conspiracy-mongering pieces that assert Republicans want to make rape and domestic violence pre-existing conditions in their Obamacare repeal bill when there is not a single word or action that backs up the allegation.”

CNN’s history is replete with getting things wrong. And then a producer gets caught on a hidden camera admitting that he knows what they’re promoting is bunk. And then you have three high-value journalists resign because a major story is insupportable and has to be retracted.

This is what happens when you decide to call your crusade against a politician you don’t like “news.” Sorta like calling an apple a banana.","Tammy Bruce: CNN's latest, desperate attempt to hammer Trump is mind-boggling",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/tammy-bruce-cnns-latest-desperate-to-hammer-trump-is-mind-boggling.html

Just ask one unfortunate half-bee, who was gnawed in two by a yellowjacket wasp in a new video posted to Reddit by user Iamnotburgerking. The video, posted without additional detail, shows the wasp pinning down and wrestling the bee and then slicing off its abdomen. The bee slayer then flies away with the bee's rear end and leaves the hapless insect's front half scrambling.

It's gross, but not very strange behavior for yellowjackets, which take a wide range of prey, said James Carpenter, curator of Hymenoptera (the group of insects that includes wasps) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The field dressing of the bee isn't unusual, either, Carpenter told Live Science.

""Social wasps cut up prey to make it transportable,"" he said. ""Indeed, sometimes they chew it up into a food ball, getting rid of the appendages."" [Beastly Feasts: Amazing Photos of Animals and Their Prey]

The common name ""yellowjackets"" comprises a large group of predatory wasps. Their large, scissor-like jaws are made for capturing and gnawing on prey. The largest yellowjacket wasps, hornets, are the most frequent predators of bees, Carpenter said. Some species specialize in attacking beehives, he said, making bee raising (apiculture) all but impossible in those wasps' territories.

""An individual hornet can sit by the entrance to the hive, just crushing the bees,"" Carpenter said. Bees can sting, but hornets and other wasps have a size advantage. As such, some colonies defend themselves by mobbing the wasp attacker, Carpenter said, thus raising the wasp's body temperature and killing it via hyperthermia.

Wasps have strange interactions with other insects, as well. In 2011, researchers reported that invasive yellowjackets in New Zealand were doing something never observed before: They were picking up ants that were nosing around their food sources, flying them a few inches away and dropping them. The confused ants would rarely make it back to the food, and the wasps managed to avoid head-to-head battles with the ants, which are capable of spraying acid at attackers.

It may be tempting to root for the poor bee in the Reddit video, but Carpenter said honeybees are actually invasive species in most areas of the world, and their presence disrupts native bees. Yellowjackets, on the other hand, keep many insect pests, including flies and beetle grubs, under control, so they can be a boon for agriculture, Carpenter said.

As for the bee's frantic head in the video, it may be destined to be wasp food, too. Wasps sometimes leave part of their prey and then return for it later, Carpenter said. There is good news for the bee, though: According to research released in April, it seems unlikely that honeybees can feel pain.

Researchers named the star Kronos, after the Titan of Greek mythology who ate his own children out of fears they'd dethrone him, according to a statement from Princeton University. Kronos belongs to a binary star system, or double-star system, located 350 light-years from Earth.

Astronomers discovered the star's ravenous habits while comparing its chemical composition to that of its stellar twin, named Krios — the Greek Titan god of the constellations and Kronos' older brother. The results showed that Kronos had an unusually high level of rock-forming minerals, suggesting it feasted on roughly 15 Earth masses' worth of rocky planets in its lifetime, according to the study. [Gallery: Dying Stars Consume Rocky Alien Planets]

Both stars — designated as HD 240430 and HD 240429, respectively — are approximately 4 billion years old, and they appear to be yellow G-type stars, similar to (but slightly younger than) the sun. Observations also showed that the stars orbit each other once every 10,000 years or so, according to the study.

At first, astronomers questioned whether the two stars were in fact a binary pair, because they are located a whopping two light-years apart. But further research confirmed that the co-moving stars have the same radial velocities. Their movements toward and away from Earth match — a key indicator of a binary star system, according to the statement.

What is most surprising about the stellar duo is that they are composed of drastically different materials. The study revealed that Kronos had an unusually high level of minerals such as magnesium, aluminum, silicon, iron, chromium and yttrium — metals that make up the bulk of rocky planets such as Earth. However, the ravenous star did not have an equally high level of volatile compounds, which are most often found in gas form, like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and potassium, according to the statement.

Most metal-rich stars ""have all the other elements enhanced at a similar level, whereas Kronos has volatile elements suppressed, which makes it really weird in the general context of stellar abundance patterns,"" Semyeong Oh, a graduate student at Princeton and lead author of the study, said in the statement.

The abundance of rock-forming minerals was concentrated in Kronos' outer layers, rather than mixed throughout the star. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed that the types of minerals in the outer layers of the star solidify at warmer temperatures — a characteristic of rocky planets, which form closer to their parent star than gas giants do.

Therefore, Kronos likely consumed 15 Earth-mass planets in order to gain the unusual abundance of rock-forming minerals, the researchers said; otherwise, the star would have a higher abundance of volatiles from gobbling up gas giants.

""All of the elements that would make up a rocky planet are exactly the elements that are enhanced on Kronos,"" Oh said. ""And the volatile elements are not enhanced, so that provides a strong argument for a planet engulfment scenario, instead of something else.""

The study also provides new insight into stellar formation and exoplanets.

""At the moment, we are still at the stage of piecing together different observations to determine how and when exoplanets form,"" said Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research.

""It's difficult to directly observe planet formation around young stars — they are typically shrouded in dust, and the stars themselves are very active, which makes it hard to disentangle any signals from the planets,"" Christiansen said. ""So we have to infer what we can from the limited information we have. If borne out, this new window onto the masses and compositions of the material in the early stages of planetary systems may provide crucial constraints for planet formation theories.""

Rosenberg, 63, pleaded guilty in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, to charges that he committed healthcare fraud and conspired to receive kickbacks to prescribe Subsys.

Prosecutors said that from 2012 to 2015, Rosenberg schemed to receive $188,000 in kickbacks in the form of speaker fees from Insys, which were a major factor in his decision to prescribe Subsys to patients.

He also fraudulently indicated that his patients suffered from cancer pain when they did not in order to secure insurance approvals for Subsys, prosecutors said.

Under a plea agreement, Rosenberg agreed to pay $754,736 in restitution to healthcare benefit programs. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 16.

Rosenberg's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Chandler, Arizona-based Insys in a statement said it has ""taken necessary and appropriate steps to prevent past mistakes from happening in the future.""

The investigations into Insys have come during a national epidemic of opioid abuse. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015. The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.

In December, federal prosecutors in Boston charged six former Insys executives and managers, including ex-Chief Executive Michael Babich, with engaging in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and defraud insurers.

All six have pleaded not guilty. Federal charges have also been filed in several other states against other ex-Insys employees and medical practitioners who prescribed Subsys.

Insys has been in settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department. It said on Wednesday it is working ""with relevant authorities to resolve issues related to the misdeeds of former employees.""

Insys also faces lawsuits by attorneys general in Arizona and New Jersey. It previously paid $9.45 million to resolve investigations by attorneys general in Oregon, New Hampshire, Illinois and Massachusetts.

Here’s one top takeaway from network news coverage in 2017: Sneaky Russian influence in American politics is a huge story if it involves Republicans/Donald Trump, but a non-story if it involves Democrats/Hillary Clinton.

MRC analysts have been tracking all evening news coverage of the Trump administration since Inauguration Day. From Inauguration Day, January 20, through last Friday, October 20, these broadcasts have aired an astonishing 1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.

Last week, The Hill published new information about Russian efforts to infiltrate the American uranium industry, including $31.3 million in payments to the Clinton Foundation, as well as a huge speaking fee delivered to Bill Clinton personally, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. In eight days, the network evening news coverage of this story amount to a mere 20 seconds on ABC’s World News Tonight.

According to an October 22 story by The Hill’s John Solomon and Alison Spann, FBI agents “were surprised by the timing and size of a $500,000 check that a Kremlin-linked bank provided Bill Clinton with for a single speech in the summer of 2010. The payday came just weeks after Hillary Clinton helped arrange for American executives to travel to Moscow to support Putin’s efforts to build his own country’s version of Silicon Valley, agents said.”","Bias Alert: 1,000 Minutes for Trump/Russia 'Collusion' vs. 20 Seconds for Hillary/Russia Scandal",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/26/bias-alert-1000-minutes-trumprussia-collusion-vs-20-seconds-hillaryrussia-scandal

The Yamaha Cross Hub concept unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show features a diamond-shaped seating arrangement that puts the driver’s seat front and center in the cabin, a passenger seat directly behind it and one on each side, midway between them.

The layout is functional as it allows for a tapered rear wall that makes enough room to fit a motorcycle diagonally in the otherwise short bed. The entire vehicle is about the same length as a Jeep Compass compact SUV, or an old Chevy LUV pickup.

The layout isn’t the only radical thing about it. There’s space between the body of the cab and the walls of the bed that allows air to flow through, and just a small bar for a tailgate that also extends the bed floor when it is opened.

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.
All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment.
i.e., sexual harassment.","While trying not to indulge in schadenfreude over those hypocritical Hollywood elites who’ve claimed to stand for “women’s rights,” only to be accused of sexually harassing them, I noticed “#MeToo” trending on Twitter. At #MeToo, women who have been sexually harassed are invited to post their experiences and many have done so, including four female U.S. senators.

I asked my adult daughter and oldest granddaughter if they had ever encountered sexual harassment. My daughter said at a previous job her boss “invited” her to sit on his lap. She refused and no longer works there.

Even more shocking was the response I received from my granddaughter, who is a nurse at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. I reprint her account (with her permission) because it contains a lesson, not only for men, but for the male-dominated culture.

I will not use her last name to protect her from more bad experiences. Crystal writes:

“It’s a tough subject to speak on. Personally, I have been sexually harassed many times in my workplace and generally speaking. All the jobs I have ever had, there has been sexual harassment. I am a nurse and have had doctors make inappropriate comments. I’ve felt very uncomfortable and have tried to ignore or ‘laugh off’ the remarks for fear of retaliation. These are doctors I have needed orders from for my patients. The last thing I need is for them to be mad at me. So, when I see the ones who have made inappropriate remarks, I smile and say hello. I’m sure if I ever went to report (them) it would somehow be turned on me like I did something wrong. So I just ‘laugh it off’ and move on, because, just like Harvey (Weinstein), doctors are the ones bringing in the big bucks and are granted immunity for certain things ... i.e., sexual harassment.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

“Generally speaking when instances occur outside of work I have stood up for myself, and am then treated as if I am wrong for doing so.”

Commenting on pictures of Hollywood actresses hugging Weinstein, Crystal continues: “I understand why these women are all smiles with this man. He is powerful in their community. He has power over their career. And I’m sure he is the reason they are famous. Like me, and so many others, these women were afraid to speak up and to stand up to this man fearing their livelihood would be negatively affected.

“Females deal with this BS constantly ... it’s never comfortable, especially when you have to continue seeing or working with the person/people. It’s always an awkward situation to be in, especially when the person has a higher position of power.

“As a mother … I think it’s important to teach our children to stick up for themselves always, and it’s never OK for someone to harass them in any way. It’s equally important for boys and girls to learn this. It’s important to teach right and wrong and promote what is right ALWAYS.”

Powerful stuff, but in an age when the lines between right and wrong, good and bad are blurred, if not eliminated, and with culture and opinion polls defining moral standards which are constantly in flux, sexual harassment is only one of many consequences when “societal norms” are obliterated.

Perhaps the best way to address this is to put more women in charge — the right kind of women, like Crystal.","Cal Thomas: #MeToo: My daughter and granddaughter, too",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/24/cal-thomas-metoo-my-daughter-and-granddaughter-too.html

The vote was 216-212, with 20 Republicans, including conservatives unhappy about deficits and debt, opposing it. Republicans could lose only 22 votes for it to pass.

“Big news - Budget just passed!” President Trump tweeted Thursday morning.

The Senate passed the measure last week and the House endorsed it without changes.

“Tax reform will help reignite the American dream,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after the vote. “It will help bring us back to a place of confidence, freedom, happiness and a stronger, healthier economy. And this budget that the House just passed, 20 minutes ago, brings us closer to making that dream a reality.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas announced that the text of the tax bill will be released Nov. 1.

“By passing this budget today, House Republicans just provided the legislative runway for pro-growth tax reform,” Brady said. “Our successful vote will allow us to move forward quickly on delivering the first overhaul of America’s tax code in more than three decades.”

Brady also said the Ways and Means Committee will consider the legislation in a committee markup beginning Nov. 6. A markup session is where the committee goes through the bill line by line and revamps the package before advancing it to the floor.

The tax bill is the top item on the GOP agenda and would be Trump's first major win in Congress.

The goal is a full rewrite of the inefficient, loophole-laden tax code in hopes of lower rates for corporations and other businesses and a spurt of economic growth.

Brady told reporters on Wednesday morning that he's still looking at curtailing tax-free deposits in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could raise revenue in the near term as retirement savings shift to Roth-style accounts that are funded with after-tax earnings.

Trump says he opposes curbing 401(k) donations, however, which tossed a monkey wrench into the process.

Key decisions about tax brackets, including a new bracket for high-income earners, remain up in the air. Outcomes on other provisions are unsettled as well, lending a sense of chaos as GOP leaders rush to fulfill a goal of passing the measure through the House before Thanksgiving.

Republicans view passage of the tax measure as a career-defining dream, and its importance has only grown in the wake of the party's debacle on health care.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is considered one of the most acute side effects of cancer therapy and affects up to 80 percent of patients, according to the National Institute of Health.

Varubi works by blocking the activation of neurokinin (NK)-1 receptors in the nervous system that play an important role in nausea and vomiting.

Other FDA-approved (NK)-1 receptor antagonist drugs to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting include Merck & Co Inc's Emend, which had sales of $549 million last year.

Bitcoin has soared to a record this year, up 500% and trading near the $6,000 level, as tracked by Coindesk.

There has been much debate by the world’s top bankers over how the virtual currency actually works. Unlike new money in a conventional financial system, bitcoin is not backed by any government or central bank, such as the Federal Reserve.

In September, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) called bitcoin a “fraud” and said it will eventually blow up.

""The currency isn't going to work. You can't have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,"" Dimon said while speaking at an investor conference.

However, Thiel proposed a different take: “The argument it’s based on is the security of the math which tells you it can never be diluted by government… it can’t be hacked and it’s a form of money that’s… secure in an absolute way.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (BLK) has called it an “index for money laundering,” and most recently, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed predicted it would implode.

Created in 2009, the controversial currency is the first semi-anonymous peer-to-peer network powered by its users and has a market cap of over $70 billion, as compared to gold, which is worth trillions, according to Thiel.

“If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold and it has a great potential left and it’s a very different kind of thing from what people in Silicon Valley focus on—companies, not algorithms not protocols, but this might be maybe one exception that is very underestimated,” the Silicon Valley elite said.

Even so, in Thiel’s opinion, like gold, it’s difficult to mine, making it more worthwhile.

“You can ask the same questions about gold. What is gold based on? Why is gold valuable?... It’s a tangible asset but it’s also hard to mine. So if it was easy to mine then it wouldn’t be that valuable and we would just have way more gold. So bitcoin is also, it’s mineable, like gold it’s hard to mine, it’s actually harder to mine than gold and so in that sense it’s more constrained,” he said.

This article originally appeared on the New York Post.","When Shawn-Marie Riley arrived at what’s believed to be the world’s only plus-size resort, the 375-pound Texan immediately felt right at home.

“Being able to feel ‘normal,’ even for a little while, was beyond a gift,” says the 5-foot-8 benefits administrator of her visit to the Resort, on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Riley says she loved it so much, she plans to return next year.

The secret retreat, founded two years ago by entrepreneur James King, encourages fuller-figured tourists to let it all hang out while on vacation. They can loll on chaise lounges built to hold 560 pounds; sleep — or enjoy worry-free sex — on king-size, steel-reinforced beds; and stroll the private beach without what King calls “fear of judgment.”

“What’s so great is [the Resort’s] recognition that people of size have insecurities and challenges that the general public never considers,” Riley tells The Post of her visit in November 2015, soon after it opened. “Will they have chairs I can sit on? Will the bed hold my weight? Will I fit in the tub?

“Can you imagine how it feels to walk down a beach and hear people refer to you as a beached whale?” continues Riley, who lives in Arlington, Texas. “I wore a bikini and never felt uncomfortable, and I was noticed for my beauty, not my size. Living as a plus-size person in a judgmental world is stressful.”

King says around 60 percent of his clientele are American, and roughly 10 percent of them come from the New York metro area.

The rest travel from as far afield as the UK and Spain.

Activities include swimming and kayaking on a nearby lagoon. Other options are boating or fishing.

King — who was inspired to found the resort because previous hotels he worked at didn’t cater to obese people — books only small groups of up to 24 people at a time. The $16,400 rate for a six-day stay includes three buffets a day. Drinks and tips are on the honor system.

King says he used to take individual guests but insists on group bookings to preserve the homely atmosphere.

“For the first couple of months, we did single bookings, but the issue was a lot of people just started to relax and feel comfortable and then new people turned up,” he says.

Why should Swiss bankers answer to the U.S. when they didn't violate Swiss law?","I am in Switzerland this week interacting with and lecturing to students and faculty at the University of Zurich. The subject of our work is the U.S. Constitution and its protections of personal liberty.

In most countries, government has begrudgingly granted snippets of personal liberty to keep those who are demanding it at bay. Throughout history, kings and other tyrants have, from time to time, given in to pressures from folks to recognize their natural rights. These instances of ""power granting liberty,"" as the practice has come to be known, usually have come about to avoid further bloodshed.

In the United States and in Switzerland, however, the opposite took place. In both countries, sovereign states came together to establish a central government peacefully. This model is known as ""liberty granting power."" Indeed, the Swiss Constitution is modeled on our own, whereby free and independent states delegated some of their sovereignty to a new, limited central government.

Today, however, the two countries are embroiled in a below-the-radar dispute over whether U.S. federal courts can try Swiss nationals who have diligently followed Swiss law and who have never been in the U.S.

Here is the back story.

When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he included a section he would later refer to as the indictment of British King George III. It characterized the “long train of abuses and usurpations” designed by the king to “harass our people, and eat out their substance.” This was harsh language, even by today’s standards.

One of those abuses and usurpations was “for transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.” He was referring to the British practice of charging colonists -- who had never been to Great Britain -- in London for behavior that was lawful in the Colonies but somehow allegedly ran afoul of English law.

The typical charge was speaking out and inducing others to oppose the king and Parliament or refusing to pay their unlawful taxes. These so-called crimes were often generally characterized as treason against the Crown.

This British practice of dragging American colonists before British judges and British juries was so offensive to the colonists that the Framers sought to prevent it from happening here by crafting two prophylactic clauses in the Constitution itself. One clause defined treason as only levying war against the United States or giving aid and comfort to our enemies. The other clause required that people be tried in the state where such crimes were alleged to have been committed.

The Constitution recognizes that American people and property can be harmed by foreigners in foreign countries, and the common law at the time required that if there was no harm, there was no crime.

These first principles -- crime is harm and people should be tried in the place where they are accused of committing a crime -- have been bedrocks of Anglo-American jurisprudence for hundreds of years.

The reason for trying a criminal case in the place where the action took place is to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process. The form of due process requires the pre-existence of the statute allegedly violated, notice of the violation, a trial before a neutral judge and jurors, and the right to appeal the trial’s outcome, but the essence of due process is fairness.

Fairness at trial means that the defendant has the constitutionally required tools available to him, not the least of which are witnesses and tangible things to aid in his defense. The Framers knew this would be nearly impossible to achieve in a foreign land before a foreign court.

This understanding subsisted until the Reagan administration, when the government began seizing foreigners abroad and bringing them to the U.S. for trial. Though these seizures were repellent, the crimes -- violence against individuals or large-scale distribution of dangerous drugs -- were crimes everywhere, and the harm caused by them was palpable.

Until now.

Now Swiss bankers who have followed and respected Swiss banking laws -- which honor the privacy of customers, no matter who they are -- and who have never caused harm to American people or property are on trial in the U.S.

The charges? Violating U.S. banking laws by failing to report suspicious transactions to U.S. banking regulators. And for those “pretended offenses,” these bankers have been transported “beyond Seas” for trial.

The Department of Justice is unable to point to any harm caused by these so-called offenses, but federal judges, just as they did in the Reagan era, are accepting the DOJ argument of universal jurisdiction -- that somehow American federal courts can try anyone, no matter where a person is said to have committed a crime, as long as the defendant is physically in the courtroom.

But this violates the Declaration of Independence and Constitution’s first principles, and it subjects American bankers and government officials to the same pretended universal jurisdiction of foreign courts. Indeed, a court in Spain has indicted former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan.

Why should Bush and Rumsfeld answer to Spain for events that allegedly occurred in Afghanistan? Why should Swiss bankers answer to the U.S. when they didn't violate Swiss law?

This is all about power and the fiction of universal jurisdiction -- a fiction the Framers thought they had buried. It needs to be buried again.",Judge Andrew Napolitano: Why are Swiss bankers on trial in the US when they didn’t violate any Swiss law?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/judge-andrew-napolitano-why-are-swiss-bankers-on-trial-in-us-when-didn-t-violate-any-swiss-law.html

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

However, it’s important that you understand the early signs of this illness in the event that you or someone you love develops this dangerous disease.

According to the American Cancer Society, as many as 20 percent of people with lung cancer were diagnosed as non-smokers. While these patients may have eliminated an important risk, secondhand smoke, environmental factors or gene mutations may have triggered their onset.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WARNING SIGNS AND PREVENTION

In addition, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death as well as one of the most common types of cancers overall. Of new cancers diagnosed each year in the U.S., about 14 percent are lung cancer cases.

Important Signs of Lung Cancer

With numbers like the ones above, you shouldn’t wait around with lung cancer. If you notice any of these 5 common signs of lung cancer, consult your doctor immediately.

1. Persistent cough

A common cold or other respiratory illness will cause a cough, but only for about a week or two. If your cough keeps going for a month or more, you should get it checked out. Also, let your doctor know if you’re getting sick repeatedly, and each illness goes straight to your chest.

2. Abnormal breathing or wheezing

Patients with lung cancer usually notice a change in breathing. Having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing after activities you normally find easy suggests a problem.

10 SIGNS THAT YOUR SNIFFLES ARE A SINUS INFECTION

Similarly, don’t dismiss wheezing as a symptom of allergies unless your doctor has confirmed it. Wheezing happens when your lungs are constricted or blocked. Check into it, especially if you haven’t had a recent cold or known allergies.

3. Hoarse voice

Lung cancer may start pressing on the nerve that controls the larynx. When that happens, you will notice a change in your voice, such as a deepening or hoarseness. You should take note if the change lasts for more than two weeks and let your doctor know about this symptom.

4. Unexplained weight loss

Have you lost weight without trying recently? Although effortless weight loss might excite you, it could mean a deeper problem and needs your doctor’s evaluation. Coupled with any of the other symptoms here, the weight loss may directly signify lung cancer.

5. Back pain

Finally, a lesser known sign of lung cancer is a deep ache in your bones or joints. Many feel this ache in the back or hips, and the pain may worsen overnight with sleeping.

Diagnosis: What to Expect

The best way for your doctor to screen you for lung cancer is through a low-dose CT scan. A simple X-ray may not catch the disease in its early stages. During the CT scan, an X-ray will scan your body while low doses of radiation will create detailed pictures of your lungs for your doctor.

PAY ATTENTION TO THESE EARLY SIGNS OF OVARIAN CANCER

If the results of the scan appear abnormal, your doctor may order a tissue sample (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis. He may also recommend a sputum test to see if there are cancer cells there.

Then, the next step after diagnosis is determining the extent of the lung cancer. At this point, your doctor may recommend further CT scans, PET scans, bone scans or an MRI to get an accurate analysis. The type of test will depend on your specific situation.

Treatment Options

Again, your treatment will depend largely on the type and stage of lung cancer as well as your own preferences. For non-small cell lung cancer, your doctor can recommend a variety or combination of treatments:

Surgery – Doctors will work to remove the cancer and may need to remove tissue or part of the lung in further stages. Specialists often work together in these cases. Expect shortness of breath after any lung surgery.

Targeted therapy – You may be able to take these drugs alongside chemotherapy. The drugs target abnormalities in cancer cells, and your doctor may need further testing to ensure that the therapy will help.

Radiation – This method uses high doses of radiation from X-rays or another source to kill cancer cells.

Chemotherapy – Here, your doctor will give you oral or IV drugs that will kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often used in combination with any of the above treatments.

For small cell lung cancer, you will probably receive radiation and chemotherapy as your main treatment. In either case, you may also choose to participate in clinical trials.

Because of outside factors, lung cancer does happen to both smokers and non-smokers. Although smoking or age may increase your risk, you should stay aware of any early signs of this disease. As with any cancer, treatment proves much easier and faster in the early stages.

And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us.

I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts.","Loving big is a way of life around our house. Everyone is welcome. Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

RELATED: How to Clean Your Whole House With Vinegar

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real.
It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem.
Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power.
The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.","Yet another anti-male group has emerged, this time in Washington D.C. It’s called Rethink Masculinity, and it is billed as a community where “people identifying as men” learn how social constructs of masculinity are harmful and then subsequently work to construct “healthier” ways to be men. The program joins a host of other like-minded initiatives, most of which are on college campuses—such as the Men’s Project at the University of Wisconsin, Masculinity 101 at Brown, and the Duke Men’s Project.

The goal of these programs is always the same: “to help men examine their own biases and behaviors in order to cut down on misogyny and gender-based violence,” writes Olivia Campbell at New York magazine.

Adds Campbell, “There’s no doubt the problems these classes aim to tackle are pervasive ones — a reality that’s been made especially, painfully clear in recent days and weeks, as the Harvey Weinstein revelations have pushed discussions of sexual assault and harassment to the forefront. But can a class really be enough to chip away at something so deeply entrenched?”

Probably not, notes Eric Mankowski, associate chair of the psychology department at Portland State University. “A single class is unlikely to undo years of socialization in toxic masculinity.”

Years of socialization in toxic masculinity. Right, because the recent events regarding men behaving badly, whether in the media, in Hollywood, or even on college campuses, couldn’t possibly be anything but that.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem. It means power is.

It couldn’t possibly be that the stories about which we’re far too privy represent the basest of the base—individual human beings who lack basic decency and character and who do not represent an entire sex. It couldn’t be that we know too much for our own good and at the same time know nothing specific about the events themselves. It couldn’t be that women on campus or in Hollywood or in the media are culpable in any way—because we all know women are always innocent and men, well, are not. It couldn’t be that those bastions of left-wing groupthink in all three of these arenas are, by their very nature, corrupt.

Because out here in the middle of the country, that vast area between the two coasts where most Americans live, healthy masculinity abounds. Out here in the middle of the country, where regular people live regular lives, masculine men are in fact quite lovely. They love and respect women. They love their country and their families. They’re good husbands and fathers who would never dream of forsaking it all for a romp in the hay.

And the women? They love and respect men, too—as they are, not as they “should” be. They also know how to take care of themselves and say no to bad behavior. They don’t put up with nonsense from men unless they want the nonsense. And if they do, they own it. Because they know women are as flawed as men.

That is not to suggest nothing bad happens between New York and California. It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem. Greed, power and corruption—which dominate on the Coasts—is the problem. When you throw those elements into the mix, both sexes get into trouble. Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power. The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.

It’s time to call a spade a spade. All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem.

It means power is.

So what’s the answer? Either stay away from environments that are clearly corrupt and opt for a clean, simple life instead. Or go for it and know what you’re getting into. And the second you smell something untoward, which you will, do what Angelina Jolie did: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.”

In other words, you can be smart or you can be desperate. If you’re desperate for power, you will inevitably become part of the madness. If you’re smart and play your cards right, as Mayim Bialik explains in this essay, you may—may—rise above the fray.

In a perfect world, power wouldn’t cause people to behave like animals instead of like humans. But we don’t live in such a world. And here’s the most important part: none of us can change this fact. It’s human nature at its ugliest, and we can’t control it.

You can spend your life trying if you like.

Flake says our kids are going to ask what we did to stop what is happening and Flake’s honest answer will be he quit. And he is quitting. But the media narrative on both sides is convenient, self-serving, and a fabrication.

I’m sorry Trump haters, but Jeff Flake is no martyr who spoke truth to power and met defeat for doing so. I’m sorry Trump humpers, but Steve Bannon did not defeat Jeff Flake in a game of 13 dimensional chess. The truth is Jeff Flake defeated himself.

Jeff Flake had a 100 percent lifetime Club for Growth record in the United States House of Representatives. He was a conservative’s conservative and stood up to the House GOP leadership. He used that reputation to catapult himself into the Senate with the backing of most every major conservative group. He towed a tough line on the budget, ObamaCare, immigration, etc.

Then he got to the Senate and promptly caved on it all. Friends of his tell me that he had no support system in the Senate. In the House, at least, there were other Club for Growth candidates. The smaller Senate with even fewer conservatives unleashed Jeff Flake’s need to be liked. He went from being a reliable Club for Growth members to a reliable Mitch McConnell member.

Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

Voters in Arizona felt betrayed.

Democrats had no use for Flake because he spent years campaigning as a hard core conservative. Republicans had no use for him because he lied his way into the Senate, promptly doing the opposite of many of his core campaign promises. Flake failed to build a new coalition of support while heaping scorn on his existing coalition.

Flake could have been opposed to President Trump and even been outspoken about it. But he could not sell out his conservatism and then become an outspoken Trump critic. That is, however, what he chose to do.

So yesterday he gave a fancy speech giving all the anti-Trump forces their rhetorical viagra. The media fell over in a rapturous applause. And no one bothered to remember all politics is local. Jeff Flake defeated himself with a series of poor decisions over six years that alienated him from his base, alienated Republican donors who he heavily pursued in 2012, and then alienated Trump fans.

Hillary Clinton has brought hellfire down upon her own head by demanding a thorough and intensive investigation into purported Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

She is right, Americans should be appalled at the idea that Vladimir Putin and his thuggish operatives might gain a foothold in our body politic. She is right again that Moscow has aggressively tried to subvert our democracy.

But it turns out that it wasn’t Donald Trump who was complicit in those efforts but Hillary Clinton, husband Bill, and possibly her boss Barack Obama.

These stories have circulated for some time; now there is proof. The Hill has reported that beginning in 2009 “the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States.”

Hillary Clinton has brought the story center stage as well. Had she not written her whiny 400-page fable ""What Happened,"" accusing the Russians of undermining her all-but-certain victory, it is possible that her ties to Moscow would have continued to be ignored by the mainstream media.

Documents show that the FBI sat on the investigation for four years, “essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.”

One such decision concerned the 2010 sale of Uranium One, a company that owned 20 percent of American uranium reserves, to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom. While the deal awaited a green light from CFIUS, an inter-agency group including Hillary’s State Department responsible for reviewing such transactions, her husband Bill was paid $500,000 for a single speech to Renaissance Capital, a Kremlin-connected bank, with which he had no prior relationship. Bill Clinton also earned a meeting with Vladimir Putin.

In addition, Moscow-related entities ponied up millions in donations to a Clinton charity.

The Uranium One story first came to light in Peter Schweizer’s 2015 book ""Clinton Cash,"" which reviewed many situations in which Bill and Hillary Clinton appear to have traded their influence for speaking fees paid to Bill or donations to the Clinton Foundation. Encouraged by Schweizer’s reporting, The Wall Street Journal researched the allegations; the Journal concluded “…that at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during [Clinton’s] tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation.”

Schweizer charged that Hillary agreed to the purchase of Uranium One by Russia’s state nuclear agency in exchange for $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The National Review recently put the figure received at $145 million.) The payments were not revealed on the Clinton Foundation website, despite an agreement with the Obama administration to do so signed by the Secretary of State. Instead, the funds flowed through a Canadian offshoot, the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, and therefore escaped notice.

Meanwhile, investigators have also discovered that the bogus and discredited dossier that sparked several investigations into suspected collusion between Donald Trump and Russia was funded by the Clinton campaign. “Opposition research” as it is called, is not illegal. But, the revelation that the DNC and Clinton campaign paid GPS Fusion to assemble the salacious anti-Trump file, which was apparently shared with the FBI and ultimately used as a rationale for spying on Trump campaign workers and even the president himself, is alarming. Political apparatchiks should not be working hand-in-hand with our intel organizations; those are police state tactics.

The Uranium One sale is not new, but the newly exposed information about the early FBI probe into Moscow’s influence-buying and the Clintons has brought the story back into the headlines.

Hillary Clinton has brought the story center stage as well. Had she not written her whiny 400-page fable ""What Happened,"" accusing the Russians of undermining her all-but-certain victory, it is possible that her ties to Moscow would have continued to be ignored by the mainstream media.

Similarly, if Eliot Spitzer had not aggressively prosecuted prostitution rings, his participation in one might have escaped notice. How could he have been so stupid? Is it because powerful people simply think they are above the law? Or are they blinded to their own hypocrisy?

How could Hillary have been so stupid? Is it so important to blame her election loss on sexism, James Comey, the unfair media (yes, she really thinks they did her in!), fake news and, most important, Trump’s dalliance with the Kremlin, that she didn’t even consider where the search would go?

Democrats must be frantic. Hillary Clinton continues to suck up all the oxygen in the room, and not in a good way. Her book tour and endless interviews, her vow to “keep going,” has kept her in the spotlight. With her help, we journey back through her long history of dissembling and diversion, and to other times that Clinton has fended off scandalous revelations. Before the emergence of Monica Lewinsky’s infamous blue dress, Clinton said the allegations about Bill’s philandering were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy.”

Now, she is less poetically calling the shocking tale of Russia-linked pay-to-play “baloney” and as I write this probably drafting a memo on how her campaign funded the Trump dossier without her knowledge.

The good news is that these stories remind Americans why they elected Donald Trump. Even as the GOP is rocked with divisions and the president engages in ill-considered and disagreeable contretemps with too many adversaries, those who voted for him can pat themselves on the back. At least, they can say, we didn’t elect Hillary. And they would be right.","Hillary Clinton is right: We must get to the bottom of Russian influence buying, especially hers",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/hillary-clinton-is-right-must-get-to-bottom-russian-influence-buying-especially-hers.html

How do you know when the liberal media meltdown is approaching an apex? Just look for apples, bananas and a strong smell of smug.

And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be.

The Uranium One story first came to light in Peter Schweizer’s 2015 book ""Clinton Cash,"" which reviewed many situations in which Bill and Hillary Clinton appear to have traded their influence for speaking fees paid to Bill or donations to the Clinton Foundation. Encouraged by Schweizer’s reporting, The Wall Street Journal researched the allegations; the Journal concluded “…that at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during [Clinton’s] tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation.”

Schweizer charged that Hillary agreed to the purchase of Uranium One by Russia’s state nuclear agency in exchange for $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The National Review recently put the figure received at $145 million.) The payments were not revealed on the Clinton Foundation website, despite an agreement with the Obama administration to do so signed by the Secretary of State. Instead, the funds flowed through a Canadian offshoot, the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, and therefore escaped notice.

Meanwhile, investigators have also discovered that the bogus and discredited dossier that sparked several investigations into suspected collusion between Donald Trump and Russia was funded by the Clinton campaign. “Opposition research” as it is called, is not illegal. But, the revelation that the DNC and Clinton campaign paid GPS Fusion to assemble the salacious anti-Trump file, which was apparently shared with the FBI and ultimately used as a rationale for spying on Trump campaign workers and even the president himself, is alarming. Political apparatchiks should not be working hand-in-hand with our intel organizations; those are police state tactics.

The Uranium One sale is not new, but the newly exposed information about the early FBI probe into Moscow’s influence-buying and the Clintons has brought the story back into the headlines.

Hillary Clinton has brought the story center stage as well. Had she not written her whiny 400-page fable ""What Happened,"" accusing the Russians of undermining her all-but-certain victory, it is possible that her ties to Moscow would have continued to be ignored by the mainstream media.

Similarly, if Eliot Spitzer had not aggressively prosecuted prostitution rings, his participation in one might have escaped notice. How could he have been so stupid? Is it because powerful people simply think they are above the law? Or are they blinded to their own hypocrisy?

How could Hillary have been so stupid? Is it so important to blame her election loss on sexism, James Comey, the unfair media (yes, she really thinks they did her in!), fake news and, most important, Trump’s dalliance with the Kremlin, that she didn’t even consider where the search would go?

Democrats must be frantic. Hillary Clinton continues to suck up all the oxygen in the room, and not in a good way. Her book tour and endless interviews, her vow to “keep going,” has kept her in the spotlight. With her help, we journey back through her long history of dissembling and diversion, and to other times that Clinton has fended off scandalous revelations. Before the emergence of Monica Lewinsky’s infamous blue dress, Clinton said the allegations about Bill’s philandering were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy.”

Now, she is less poetically calling the shocking tale of Russia-linked pay-to-play “baloney” and as I write this probably drafting a memo on how her campaign funded the Trump dossier without her knowledge.

The good news is that these stories remind Americans why they elected Donald Trump. Even as the GOP is rocked with divisions and the president engages in ill-considered and disagreeable contretemps with too many adversaries, those who voted for him can pat themselves on the back. At least, they can say, we didn’t elect Hillary. And they would be right.","Hillary Clinton is right: We must get to the bottom of Russian influence buying, especially hers",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/25/hillary-clinton-is-right-must-get-to-bottom-russian-influence-buying-especially-hers.html

Hector Trujillo, 63, was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn. He had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy in June.



Trujillo admitted accepting nearly $200,000 in bribes from a company trying to secure sports marketing contracts.



Prosecutors said the former general secretary of Guatemala's soccer federation should serve more than three years in prison and pay $415,000 in restitution. Defense lawyers asked for no prison time for crimes between 2009 and 2016.



According to Trujillo's plea agreement, he would not contest any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison. Trujillo also agreed to forfeit $175,000. Free on $4 million bail, he has been staying in Miami.



He was arrested in December 2015 in Port Canaveral, Fla., during a Disney cruise with his family.



Prosecutors said in pre-sentence papers that Trujillo minimized the seriousness of his crime by noting he did not violate the laws of Guatemala, even as he indisputably broke FIFA rules.



""While the defendant may not have played the largest role or pocketed the most money of all of the defendants in the case, his conduct nevertheless shows that he engaged in the same type of conduct as the rest of the corrupt soccer officials who have been charged,"" prosecutors wrote. ""And that corrupt conduct requires a significant sentence.""



Defense lawyers had asked for leniency, saying the prosecution had ended Trujillo's ""successful and prominent career and tarnished his spotless reputation as a respected jurist and advocate."" They said his arrest had forced him to resign from his position as an alternate judge on Guatemala's constitutional court.



They also cited debilitating back and hip pain that worsened during several weeks of incarceration after his arrest and his subsequent home confinement.



The U.S. investigation of corruption linked to FIFA has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from more than 40 people and marketing agencies linked to soccer in the Americas since 2015.

Many of the charges involve bribes paid around the organization of regional tournaments and World Cup qualifying games.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

You'll witness how Castro committed this ultimate betrayal through a campaign of murder, mayhem and lies to his fellow countrymen.

You'll bear witness to Castro's 1959 victorious entrance into the city of Havana from the man who rode alongside him.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real.
It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem.
Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power.
The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.","Yet another anti-male group has emerged, this time in Washington D.C. It’s called Rethink Masculinity, and it is billed as a community where “people identifying as men” learn how social constructs of masculinity are harmful and then subsequently work to construct “healthier” ways to be men. The program joins a host of other like-minded initiatives, most of which are on college campuses—such as the Men’s Project at the University of Wisconsin, Masculinity 101 at Brown, and the Duke Men’s Project.

The goal of these programs is always the same: “to help men examine their own biases and behaviors in order to cut down on misogyny and gender-based violence,” writes Olivia Campbell at New York magazine.

Adds Campbell, “There’s no doubt the problems these classes aim to tackle are pervasive ones — a reality that’s been made especially, painfully clear in recent days and weeks, as the Harvey Weinstein revelations have pushed discussions of sexual assault and harassment to the forefront. But can a class really be enough to chip away at something so deeply entrenched?”

Probably not, notes Eric Mankowski, associate chair of the psychology department at Portland State University. “A single class is unlikely to undo years of socialization in toxic masculinity.”

Years of socialization in toxic masculinity. Right, because the recent events regarding men behaving badly, whether in the media, in Hollywood, or even on college campuses, couldn’t possibly be anything but that.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem. It means power is.

It couldn’t possibly be that the stories about which we’re far too privy represent the basest of the base—individual human beings who lack basic decency and character and who do not represent an entire sex. It couldn’t be that we know too much for our own good and at the same time know nothing specific about the events themselves. It couldn’t be that women on campus or in Hollywood or in the media are culpable in any way—because we all know women are always innocent and men, well, are not. It couldn’t be that those bastions of left-wing groupthink in all three of these arenas are, by their very nature, corrupt.

Because out here in the middle of the country, that vast area between the two coasts where most Americans live, healthy masculinity abounds. Out here in the middle of the country, where regular people live regular lives, masculine men are in fact quite lovely. They love and respect women. They love their country and their families. They’re good husbands and fathers who would never dream of forsaking it all for a romp in the hay.

And the women? They love and respect men, too—as they are, not as they “should” be. They also know how to take care of themselves and say no to bad behavior. They don’t put up with nonsense from men unless they want the nonsense. And if they do, they own it. Because they know women are as flawed as men.

That is not to suggest nothing bad happens between New York and California. It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem. Greed, power and corruption—which dominate on the Coasts—is the problem. When you throw those elements into the mix, both sexes get into trouble. Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power. The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.

It’s time to call a spade a spade. All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem.

It means power is.

So what’s the answer? Either stay away from environments that are clearly corrupt and opt for a clean, simple life instead. Or go for it and know what you’re getting into. And the second you smell something untoward, which you will, do what Angelina Jolie did: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.”

In other words, you can be smart or you can be desperate. If you’re desperate for power, you will inevitably become part of the madness. If you’re smart and play your cards right, as Mayim Bialik explains in this essay, you may—may—rise above the fray.

In a perfect world, power wouldn’t cause people to behave like animals instead of like humans. But we don’t live in such a world. And here’s the most important part: none of us can change this fact. It’s human nature at its ugliest, and we can’t control it.

You can spend your life trying if you like.

But I wouldn’t recommend it.",Masculinity isn't the problem. Power is,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/masculinity-isnt-problem-power-is.html

Sony will roll out a new robot dog that’s capable of real Fido-like feelings – including bonding with its human masters and responding to owner commands, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The pet bot will be similar to Sony’s AIBO robot pet prototypes, which have been discontinued, and will have updated software to allow users to control their home appliances.

Sony plans to unveil the product at a media event next November and roll it out in spring 2018. It’s unclear how much it will cost.

Last year, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said at a strategy briefing that the company was in the process of developing “a robot capable of forming an emotional bond with customers and able to grow to inspire love and affection.”

Sony sold about 150,000 AIBOs between 1999 and 2006 for between $600 and more than $2,000, the Journal said. The robots came with artificial intelligence allowing them to greet its owner, play with a ball, dance and sing songs.

The new pet robots will have smoother movements and improved motors and sensors. They may also include internet connectivity allowing the pooch to learn new tricks and control appliances.

That’s when four policemen came up to his car and asked if he was screaming. Moalla said he was not, but did tell the officers he had been singing.

Shortly after checking his license and registration, an officer came back with a ticket for screaming, according to CTV News. Montreal bylaw states “to cause disorder by screaming” violates “peace and tranquility” – an offense that is punishable by a fine up to $2,000, according to CTV News.

“I don’t know if my voice was very bad and that’s why I got the ticket, but I was very shocked,” Moalla told CTV News. “I understand if they are doing their job, they are allowed to check if everything’s okay, if I kidnapped someone or if there’s danger inside but I would never expect they would give me a ticket for that.”

Moalla plans to contest the ticket, CTV News reported.",Montreal man receives ticket after singing while driving,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/23/montreal-man-receives-ticket-after-singing-while-driving.html

Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church Kirill has arrived in Bucharest on the first visit to Romania by a head of the Russian church since the end of communism.

NATO and European Union member Romania has cool relations with Russia, but the countries share cultural and religious ties through their respective Orthodox churches.

Kirill arrived Thursday, a day ahead of a service celebrating ten years since Patriarch Daniel was elected head of the Romanian Orthodox church. Kirill and Daniel will lead Friday's service, joined by senior Orthodox bishops from Albania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

A low libido can happen at any point in your life for a variety of reasons. Studies show that 32 percent of women and 15 percent of men lack the desire to have sex regularly. A few potential causes of a decreased sex drive could be due to depression, stress, obesity or certain medications.

Rather than heading out to purchase new lingerie, a trip to the nearest grocery store might help. Not only does eating healthy foods help you feel better about yourself, and in turn boost your confidence, a healthy diet can also increase your mood, energy levels and stamina, which all contribute to boosting your libido. In addition to an overall healthy diet, research shows specific foods and nutrients can help sizzle things up in the bedroom. Be sure to include these five foods in your diet to supercharge your sex drive.

Avocados

A source of vitamin E for healthy skin and nails, avocados also provide potassium, vitamin B6 and monounsaturated fats for a healthy heart and circulation, which is critical for an active sex life. Studies show men with heart disease are twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction as both conditions can result from artery damage. Try some mashed avocado on your toast in the morning, or add slices to your sandwich or salad.

Chocolate (and Cocoa Powder)

One of the most popular foods for its indulgent flavor, chocolate can help boost your mood by increasing both dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, also known as your ""feel good” neurotransmitters. In addition, chocolate offers varying amounts of flavanols (a naturally occurring antioxidant in cocoa) that helps relax blood vessels and increase blood flow. Since the amount (and therefore benefits) of cocoa flavanols vary greatly in chocolate depending on the brand and how it’s processed, it’s best to get your cocoa flavanols from unsweetened cocoa powder or a fortified powder from a major manufacturer that guarantees at least 200 mg in a serving.

Fatty Fish

You may have heard that fatty fish like tuna, sardines and salmon are swimming with omega-3 fatty acids, which are not only good for your heart but also raise levels of dopamine in the brain that improve circulation and blood flow. Fish is also high in protein and a good source of vitamin B-6, which aids in healthy blood production. For example, just one ¼ cup serving of wild-caught Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna provides nearly 25 percent of your daily need for protein and 10 percent of your daily need for vitamin B-6, along with omega-3 fatty acids. Who knew a tuna fish sandwich could put you in the mood?

Green Tea

Could a hot cup of tea heat up your sex life? Green tea is rich in compounds called catechins, which in addition to helping reduce belly fat has been shown to help promote blood flow for a better sex life. Catechins promote blood flow in two ways. First, they kill off free radicals that damage and inflame blood vessels, increasing their ability to transport blood. Second, they cause blood vessel cells to release nitric oxide, which increases the size of the blood vessels, leading to improved blood flow. In addition to a hot mug of green tea, try adding it in your morning oatmeal, blend up a green tea smoothie or add some green tea powder to your yogurt or baked goods.

Pumpkin Seeds

One of the best plant sources of zinc, pumpkin seeds (or papitas) also contain protein, fiber, potassium and iron. Important for immune function, wound healing and eye health, zinc also plays a role in a man’s sex drive as having a zinc deficiency can lead to low testosterone. While it’s not exactly understood why a lack of zinc impacts testosterone, the mineral may affect the cells in the testes that produce testosterone. One study found that men who received 30 milligrams of zinc per day showed increased levels of free testosterone in their bodies. Enjoy pumpkin seeds for a snack, or add them to your salad or cooked grains for a little crunch.",5 foods to increase your libido,http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/26/5-foods-to-increase-your-libido.html

What I was amazed at, it’s almost $6 million that they paid and it’s totally discredited, it’s a total phony. I call it fake news. It’s disgraceful.

Hillary Clinton recently slammed new reports of her ties to Russia's nuclear energy deals, claiming the corruption allegations have been “debunked repeatedly.”

The former secretary of state said on C-SPAN Monday that ""It’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone.""

Trump said the Clinton camp is now trying to backtrack from the dossier that contained allegations that the Russian government had collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an active effort to assist his presidential campaign.

“It is very interesting. She denied it. Her own people denied it. Everybody and now they are sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say,” he said.

The House Intelligence Committee announced Tuesday it’s joining the House Oversight Committee in investigating why the Obama administration approved the sale of Uranium One to Russia, giving Moscow control of 20% of U.S. uranium supply, despite a federal investigation that revealed Russian kickbacks and extortion.

“That’s the real collusion, believe me. There was no collusion on my side, I can tell you that,” Trump said.

According to the Washington Post, Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained the D.C.-based firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that resulted in the infamous and controversial Trump dossier. The dossier contained allegations that the Russian government had collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an active effort to assist his presidential campaign.

The president noted that the push to connect his 2016 campaign to Russia has always been an excuse by the Democrats for losing the election.

“When you hear the kind of money they spent, and when you see all of the things about [Tony] Podesta and you see all the relationships that they actually have with Russia,” Trump said, referring to what he called Democratic efforts to link his campaign to Russia.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly investigating the Democratic lobbying group led by Tony Podesta, brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta.

The president also continued to hedge on who might be the next Federal Reserve chair as the focus appears to be on Stanford University economics professor John Taylor and current Fed Governor Jerome Powell.

“I really have it down to two and maybe three people and I think over the next, very short period of time I will be announcing it. It won’t be a shock,” Trump said.

Trump expressed his admiration for current Fed Chair Janet Yellen but said the decision to select a new head of the central bank is something to which he would like to contribute.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Typical high school stuff, right?

Normally – except the homecoming queen was also the football player who made that big kick, The Houston Chronicle reported.

""Homecoming queen knocks it through, Dawson wins. You have to love that.” - Eric Wells, coach

""It means everything that I was able to support my team the way they have supported me,"" Jeffress told Chron.com. ""From the players to the coaches to the school, everybody has completely supported me through my entire journey to my senior year.”

She added: ""I'm so glad I could experience this one tonight.""

After Jeffress, a senior, was named homecoming queen, the Renaissance woman posed for a photo wearing the standard tiara -- and her football uniform.

Jeffress, who mostly plays soccer, has been breaking barriers in the male-dominated sport since seventh grade, when she first started kicking. During the past few years, she’s worked her way through Dawson’s junior varsity before landing a varsity spot in 2016.

In her first varsity game in August of last year, Jeffress went 4-for-4 on point-after attempts, Chron.com reported.

Jeffress made the game-winning 30-yard field goal Friday after a 5-for-5 night in point-after attempts.

“Claire is something – she just doesn't get rattled,” her coach, Eric Wells, said. “There wasn't even a question that she was going to kick it. Homecoming queen knocks it through, Dawson wins.

In her book What Happened, Hillary Clinton wrote this about the notorious and lurid dossier that opposition researchers had assembled on Donald Trump when he was a candidate for president in the 2016 campaign:

""The FBI ... began investigating a dossier prepared by a well-respected former British spy that contained explosive and salacious allegations about compromising information the Russians had on Trump. The Intelligence Community took the dossier seriously enough that it briefed both President Obama and President Elect Trump on its contents before the inauguration.""

This much we already knew from news reports. But in hindsight, how queer that Clinton should have written about and talked up this dossier as though she had been a mere observer of the events that led to its creation and use. Because this week, it has been revealed that Clinton's campaign actually paid to create that very dossier. So had the Democratic National Committee, run by faithful flunky, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

It's no surprise that Clinton or her staff would play dumb about this. The dossier is a radioactive document, with which no one wants to be associated. Not only are much of its contents known to be false, but it also includes obscene allegations about Trump that we won't reprint here.

Clinton's attorney, Marc Elias, and senior campaign officials have been lying through their teeth for a year about their involvement in the dossier. When reporters tried to report the story, these Clinton Democrats pushed back hard, claiming it was an out-and-out lie. Now, their own lies have been laid bare.

The truth about the dossier is a reminder of what was and what was not at stake in last year's presidential contest. Ever since Trump's election, the moral posturing by some of America's sleaziest liars has become nearly unbearable.

In the time since the election, the Left has taken up the banner of ""Resistance."" Each time Trump makes another false, crude, bizarre, or offensive comment, they point back to the choice in November and frame the election as if falsehood conquered truth, darkness overpowered light, and an evil empire overcame good.

In the real world, however, the 2016 campaign was nothing like that. It was a contest between Trump's obvious and extensive disconnection from facts and Clinton's conniving, calculated, and self-serving lies that fit snugly into her 40-year career of corruption and falsehood.","The Trump Dossier, Like So Much Else, Is Due to the Corruption of the Clintons",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/26/trump-dossier-so-much-else-due-corruption-clintons

Her top campaign spokesman says “she may have known,” while an anonymous source is telling reporters she only learned about the dossier after BuzzFeed News published it early this year.

'[Clinton] may have known, but the degree of exactly what she knew is beyond my knowledge.' - Ex-Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon

“I don’t know what she knew or did not know,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, adding: “I would find it pretty interesting if her campaign was making decisions at that level that she didn’t know about.”

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said he can’t believe Clinton or a top official like then-campaign chairman John Podesta was not aware.

“You don’t lay out that kind of money in a campaign unless you know” how and why it’s being spent, he told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”

Clinton, though, hasn’t personally spoken up, and the rest of the Democratic brass are treating the dossier like a freelance project gone rogue.

A spokesman for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who led the DNC at the time, told Fox News on Wednesday that, “She did not have any knowledge of this arrangement.”

A DNC official stressed that current Chairman “Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization.”

In a carefully worded response, former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told CNN on Wednesday that he didn’t personally know – but left the door open as to his boss’s awareness.

“I don’t know. I haven’t asked. I haven’t spoken to her,” Fallon said. “She may have known, but the degree of exactly what she knew is beyond my knowledge.”

TRUMP RIPS CLINTON-DOSSIER LINK AS A 'DISGRACE'

The Washington Post reported this week — and Fox News confirmed — that the political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

Seeking to clarify who knew what when, Fallon suggested on CNN that the campaign could have cleared the law firm to commission “some kind of research” – but as for the decision to retain Fusion GPS and Steele, Clinton “may or may not have been aware.”

The controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaign’s possible connections to Moscow.

Trump has long denied the claims, and he and his allies are now trying to turn the tables on Democrats who have alleged Trump-Russia collusion during the campaign.

“They’re embarrassed by it, but I think it’s a disgrace,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “It’s a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”

But Fallon, seeing the coverage of his own remarks on CNN, pushed back on Republicans highlighting his suggestion that Clinton might have known about the dossier.

“So what if she did? Looking forward to the RNC reaction when the identity of the GOP funder comes out,” he tweeted, in reference to reports that an unnamed Republican client paid for the research before the Democrats stepped in.

Fallon has remained defiant over the revelations, comparing the project to the kind of “oppo research” that “happens on every campaign.” In a statement, he said, “here you had probably the most shadowy guy ever running for president and the FBI certainly has seen fit to look into it. I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election.”

But the developments could raise legal problems

The Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, filed a complaint Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission accusing the DNC and Clinton’s campaign committee of breaking campaign finance law by failing to accurately disclose the money spent on the Trump-Russia dossier.

“Questions about who paid for this dossier are the subject of intense public interest, and this is precisely the information that FEC reports are supposed to provide,” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center said in a statement to Fox News.

According to the Post, that money was routed from the Clinton campaign and the DNC through the law firm Perkins Coie and described on FEC reports as legal services.

But the Campaign Legal Center described the FEC reporting as “misleading.”

“Payments by a campaign or party committee to an opposition research firm are legal, as long as those payments are accurately disclosed,” Fischer said. “But describing payments for opposition research as ‘legal services’ is entirely misleading and subverts the reporting requirements.”

In a stunning development, the missing hard drive has not been located – and it could be key in finding out why Paddock killed 58 people in the Oct. 1 attack.

More than three weeks after the shooting, no manifesto or anything else indicating Paddock’s motive has been found, and Las Vegas police officials – who are approaching two weeks since the last time they gave an update to the public about the investigation – are remaining tight-lipped.

In addition to the searches, Paddock had set up cameras inside and outside his hotel room so he could see the hallway, authorities said, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo had said Paddock may have been using them to monitor officers descending upon his room.

He also had left a handwritten note in his room with numbers on it, which investigators believe were calculations of the distance and trajectory of his targets at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, which was taking place across the street from the resort property.

STEPHEN PADDOCK'S BROTHER ARRESTED FOR CHILD PORN

Mandalay Bay, meanwhile, has been hit with lawsuits from victims whose lawyers have been blasting MGM Resorts International for allegedly not keeping close enough tabs on Paddock.

“It's inconceivable to us that the perpetrator was capable of transporting what amounts to an actual armory of weapons into the hotel, especially in an era in which shooting incidents and terrorism are front page news on a daily basis,” attorney Richard Bridgford said in a statement to Fox News earlier this week.","Las Vegas shooting: Internet searches, missing hard drive could be key to motive",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/26/las-vegas-shooting-internet-searches-missing-hard-drive-could-be-key-to-motive.html

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years.

The top U.S. general in Iraq says the fallout from last month's Kurdish vote for independence is diverting resources away from the war on the Islamic State group just as the coalition is on the verge of defeating the extremists.

U.S.-backed Iraqi and Kurdish forces, who together have driven IS out of most of the country, are locked in an increasingly tense standoff. Low-level clashes have broken out as federal forces have driven the Kurds from disputed areas, and on Thursday Iraq's prime minister rejected a Kurdish offer to ""freeze"" the referendum, an apparent attempt by the Kurds to save face.

""We don't need Iraqis killing Iraqis when we've got Daesh to kill out in the west,"" Lt. Gen. Paul Funk told The Associated Press, using another acronym for IS, which still controls territory straddling Iraq's western border with Syria.

Clashes broke out earlier this month when federal forces retook the disputed city of Kirkuk and other areas outside the autonomous Kurdish region that the Kurds had seized when IS swept across the country in 2014. Most of the Kurdish forces withdrew without a fight, but tensions remain.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi rejected a Kurdish offer to ""freeze"" the results of the referendum, in which 90 percent voted to redraw the map. Iraq's government has demanded the annulment of the vote and the transfer of border control and other infrastructure to federal forces.

The dispute has laid bare longstanding rifts in the coalition assembled to fight the Islamic State group that could complicate efforts to flush the extremists out of their last strongholds, or create an opening for them to re-emerge.

Funk said he would have preferred to spend recent weeks focused entirely on preparations for an operation launched Thursday to drive IS from its last pockets in the western Anbar province. But in addition to supervising that operation, he has been shuttling between the commanders of Iraq's various security forces acting as a mediator in the dispute with the Kurds.

The troop movements and low-level skirmishes are also stretching the U.S.-led coalition's intelligence and surveillance resources. Drones previously used to monitor the fight against IS have been diverted to watch flashpoints in the disputed territories, and the scattered clashes have impeded the movement of coalition vehicles and equipment.

Both the U.S.-led coalition and Iran rushed weapons and trainers to Iraqi and Kurdish forces in 2014 in order to stop the IS advance and begin to roll it back. But the various forces involved, including state-sanctioned mostly Shiite militias backed by Tehran, were never brought under a unified command.

Instead of trying to integrate Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, into Iraq's military, coalition commanders divided up the battlefield during the various campaigns against IS. Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as the state-backed militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, maintained separate command and control structures in their areas of responsibility.

""There should have been an equal focus on the military goal of defeating ISIS and keeping Iraq's military institutions under a unified chain of command,"" said Maria Fantappie, a senior Iraq analyst at the International Crisis Group.

""But there was less regard (from the international community) for how this process of arming different factions in Iraq could also undermine the political stability in the aftermath of ISIS.""

She acknowledges that, at least in the summer of 2014, when Iraq's military had largely collapsed, the coalition likely had no option but to arm the various forces. ""I'm not sure what alternative choice there could have been, frankly,"" she said.

Funk, who assumed command of the U.S.-led coalition earlier this year, dismissed the idea that its military assistance laid the groundwork for future conflicts in Iraq, saying it had merely ""enhanced"" the abilities of existing forces. He added that modernizing a military is a generational endeavor, impossible to complete in just three years.

He said the eventual defeat of the IS group is ""certain,"" but that ""policy issues"" like stabilization and reconciliation will remain.

Fantappie, however, fears the further fragmentation of the country's security forces once they no longer confront the shared threat of the extremist group. She says a new rift could open up between Iraq's military and the Popular Mobilization Forces.

""In this case, against the Kurds, their interests converge, but in the future they may not,"" she said.",US general: Iraqi tensions divert resources from IS fight,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/26/us-general-iraqi-tensions-divert-resources-from-is-fight.html

""The archive was deleted from all our systems. The archive was not shared with any third parties,"" Kaspersky Lab said on Tuesday.

The Moscow-based security firm has been fighting accusations that its antivirus software helped Russian spies steal confidential files from the US National Security Agency. On Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab tried to clear the air, and said its antivirus software did indeed download the secret hacking files, but only because they were flagged as malware after an NSA contractor's home computer was reportedly infected.

""US law tolerates inadvertent acquisition of classified data, but doesn't allow to distribute it. We deleted it to follow the law,"" the company's CEO Eugene Kaspersky tweeted on Wednesday. The Russian security firm added: ""Kaspersky Lab has never created any detection of non-weaponized (non-malicious) documents in its products based on keywords like 'top secret' and 'classified'.""

In a statement, the security firm provided a timeline detailing how Kaspersky Lab came across the classified files, which seems to point the finger at the careless behavior of the NSA contractor.

In 2014, Kaspersky was investigating a shadowy hacking group called Equation, which experts now believe is actually the NSA. Ultimately, Equation Group hacking tools ended up in the hands of a group known as the Shadow Brokers, which reportedly has links to Russia.

As part of its investigation into the Equation Group, Kaspersky's antivirus software detected some unknown malicious code in a 7-zip archive on a US home computer. The archive was then uploaded to Kaspersky Lab for analysis, and was found to contain an arsenal of hacking tools.

According to Kaspersky Lab, the computer in question at one point downloaded and installed pirated software that contained a separate piece of malware called ""Backdoor.Win32.Mokes.hvl."" Kaspersky's software flagged it as malicious. However, to get the pirated software to run, the computer's user disabled Kaspersky's antivirus product. The computer was then infected with a backdoor that Kaspersky Lab says can give a hacker remote control over the system.

Kaspersky Lab isn't sure how long the computer was infected with the backdoor. But its software first detected its presence on Oct. 4 2014, with a final detection on Nov. 17 of that year. It's also unclear who may have been in control of the backdoor.

Jake Williams, founder of US cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec, said ""I think the story Kaspersky has laid out is completely plausible.""

It'll be up to the US government to back up its own claims against Kaspersky, he added. ""And they need to back their claims with data, not just accusations,"" Williams said.

Many of the accusations against Kaspersky have come from media reports that largely cite anonymous sources. Nevertheless, the US Department of Homeland Security is forcing federal agencies to stop using the company's antivirus software. Retailers such as Best Buy have also dropped Kaspersky Lab products from store shelves.

In response, Kaspersky Lab has offered up an independent review of the company's source code for flaws.

The 77-year-old stars as Rosa on UP TV’s family-friendly sitcom “Date My Dad.” The show tells the story of Ricky Cooper, Rosa's son-in-law, who completely dedicates his life to fatherhood after losing his beloved wife Isabella.

But three years later, his three daughters are willing to do anything to see their father fall in love and find happiness again. Barry Watson, of “7th Heaven” fame, plays the comical patriarch who gets some much-needed help from his live-in mother-in-law.

“The minute I got the script, I just thought it was great fun,” Welch told Fox News. “And I loved the idea. It’s comedy. I’m good at comedy, if I can say so myself. And it’s something I enjoy doing. It was a no-brainer for me.""

""... I could be a grandmother myself. My children are not cooperating,"" she joked. ""But I am a mother and I have seen my son go through a marriage that failed… I was very interested and it’s not a real stretch for me…. I’m enjoying the whole darn thing.”

Welch was thrilled to be paired up with fellow actor Robert Wagner, Watson’s real-life father-in-law. The 87-year-old guest starred in “Date My Dad” as Welch’s love interest. She was eager to reunite with her former co-star from the 1968 comedy “The Biggest Bundle of Them All.”

“There wasn’t a particular rapport [in the movie] except, of course, he’s Robert Wagner and what’s not to like?” she explained. “We had a really good time...

It’s all been very enjoyable, I have to say.”

Welch is no stranger to working alongside Hollywood's most notable leading men. Back in 1964, she had the chance to work with her teenage crush in “Rousetabout” — Elvis Presley. However, Welch was surprised by the singer when she met him on set.

“I first saw him when I was 14 in a concert performance in San Diego, along with a whole bunch of screaming teenagers,"" explained Welch. ""He was pretty irresistible. I was just all a flutter as a young girl. But when I finally did meet him [on set], he just didn’t look the same. It looked like they cleaned him up.

""It was like white bread or something. It was not at all his kind of sassiness that he exhibited on stage. The way he wore his hair, the kind of clothes he wore, the way he moved. It was just all very polite now… What happened to the rebellious, sexy guy? I was so in love with him as a teenager.”

Welch would later see Presley again in Las Vegas, where he underwent another transformation.

“He was now wearing a lot of studded jumpsuits,” recalled Welch. “That was not the Elvis I was crazy about. He still sounded like Elvis, but there was such a difference about it. He didn’t sound like he was 100 percent. It was more like he was doing it for all his fans. He enjoyed the adulation, obviously. But it didn’t seem to me like his involvement in the earlier part of his career was there. He didn’t have the passion anymore. He just performed a tremendous amount.”

Presley died in 1977 at age 42. Welch wondered if his non-stop performing schedule contributed to his early demise.

“They just had him on a treadmill all the time, repeating every wonderful thing that he did,” she said. “And you could tell it was not fun for him anymore. It was a sad, sad thing that happened to him... I just think he was a nice Southern boy.”

Meanwhile, one co-star who left Welch speechless was Frank Sinatra. They both appeared in 1968’s “Lady in Cement.” She particularly remembered seeing the singer on stage at Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel.

“You could hear a pin drop when he was singing a ballad,” said Welch. “[When] Frank came out on the stage, he had everybody eating out of his hand at about 37 seconds… He was just flawless. He could break your heart, make you fall in love with him or make you think he was a scamp… You could picture a whole existence around [his lyrics]… That’s what I discovered about Frank.”

These days, Welch is happily savoring the success of her lasting career, which is why she probably won’t take any advice from her new character Rosa.

“[But] I’m not really trying to date with any real seriousness,” said Welch. “You know, I go out occasionally but you know, it’s not a campaign that I’m on. I’m busy a lot and I like to work. I guess I’m in love with my life in general.

""It’s been a lot of fun. It’s been demanding, to a point. A lot of men don’t like that anyhow. They don’t like their lady to have other things that take precedent sometimes. They don’t particularly like that. That’s what women everywhere don’t want to hear, but unfortunately it does happen to be true. I’m kind of a realist.”

While UP TV hasn’t announced a Season 2 date for “Date My Dad"" quite yet, fans and curious viewers alike can stream the series online. Welch is yearning to meet up with her cast mates and see what new adventures Rosa will take her on.

“If we can just be blessed with a continuation of this show, I think it would be wonderful,"" said Welch.","Raquel Welch talks working with Robert Wagner, meeting Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/raquel-welch-talks-working-with-robert-wagner-meeting-elvis-presley-and-frank-sinatra.html

Temperatures across Southern California are expected to top 100 degrees during the next few days as part of a late October heatwave.

The National Weather Service warned of dangerous heat Tuesday and Wednesday, with highs predicted to reach 95 to 105 degrees in many areas, coupled with hot, gusty Santa Ana winds that could reach 60 mph at times.

Despite the heat, Kershaw warmed up wearing his Dodgers jacket. Fewer fans than usual watched the team take batting practice from the exposed outfield pavilion seats, while others sought any shade they could find.

""They're from Houston, I'm from Texas, it's going to be hot for everybody,'' Kershaw said when asked about the heat. ""We're all used to it. It will be fine.''

Elsewhere in the region, Downtown Los Angeles passed its 108-year-old record of 99 degrees for the date before midday Tuesday.

Even proximity to the ocean was no relief, as surfing mecca Huntington Beach also reached 103.



The Los Angeles Fire Department declared its first citywide Red Flag Alert since May 2014, banning vehicles from being parked on roads in areas designated as very high fire hazard zones for at least 24 hours starting at 8 a.m. Tuesday.

""These are narrow streets with hairpin turns, areas that would essentially create a chokepoint if a car was parked there while people were trying to evacuate out and a fire apparatus is trying to get into those areas to extinguish a fire,"" Captain Erik Scott with the LAFD told FOX 11.

Southern California fire agencies put extra firefighters on duty. Rangers patrolling the Santa Monica Mountains were on the lookout for signs of fire or risks such as people smoking in the sprawling area covered with dangerously flammable dry grass.

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” the star wrote over an image of her gawking, mouth agape, at Perry’s breasts.

In the wake of the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal, of which DeGeneres was an outspoken critic, dedicating part of her show to sharing her thoughts on the “#MeToo” movement, many fans were quick to mention the idea that this tweet wouldn’t fly had a man posted it. Many began responding to the tweet with the hashtag “#doublestandard.” Others went as far as to compare her to Weinstein and call her a “pig.”

As The Wrap notes, actor Michael Rapaport caught wind of the tweet and voiced his displeasure to Ellen, arguing that “the world would stop” if a man had sent this tweet.

Piers Morgan too speculated that, had a man tweeted something similar, Ellen would be leading the “cries of ‘SEXIST PIG!’”

Previously, the star dedicated her opening monologue to denouncing the growing environment of sexual harassment in Hollywood with an impassioned speech.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood or political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness.

Al-Khelaifi met with Swiss prosecutors two weeks after they announced the case against him.","A Guatemalan judge who once served as general secretary of his country's soccer federation is expected to be the first person sentenced in the U.S. in the world soccer bribery scandal.

Hector Trujillo, 63, is set to receive his sentence Wednesday in a federal courtroom in Brooklyn, N.Y., after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy in June.

Trujillo confessed to accepting almost $200,000 in bribes from a company that tried to secure sports marketing contracts.

Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of more than three years in prison and suggest Trujillo should pay $415,000 in restitution. The defense is asking for no time behind the bars for crimes committed between 2009 and 2016, and urged the judge to show leniency because the case ended Trujillo’s “successful and prominent career and tarnished his spotless reputation as a respected jurist and advocate.”

They also said the arrest forced Trujillo to resign as an alternate judge on Guatemala's constitutional court and say his health debilitated following the arrest by U.S. authorities.

Under the plea agreement, Trujillo will not object any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison, and agreed to forfeit $175,000.

He is currently living in Miami, free on $4 million bail.

Trujillo was arrested in December 2015 in Florida during a Disney cruise with his family. In pre-sentence papers, prosecutors argue that he underrates the seriousness of his committed crimes, claiming he did not violate the laws of Guatemala, despite breaking FIFA rules.

""While the defendant may not have played the largest role or pocketed the most money of all of the defendants in the case, his conduct nevertheless shows that he engaged in the same type of conduct as the rest of the corrupt soccer officials who have been charged. And that corrupt conduct requires a significant sentence,"" prosecutors said in court documents.

The U.S. investigation of corruption scandal linked with FIFA has led to indictments or guilty pleas from more than 40 people and companies linked to the sport in the America since 2015.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain soccer club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, a 43-year-old Qatari soccer and television executive, was questioned Wednesday by Swiss authorities who accuse him of bribing a FIFA official in a World Cup broadcasting rights deal.

Al-Khelaifi is accused of letting former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke to use his luxury villa on the Island of Sardinia – seized two weeks ago by Italian authorities – in exchange for 2026-2030 broadcasting rights of the World Cup.

Al-Khelaifi met with Swiss prosecutors two weeks after they announced the case against him. The Qatari executive denies the allegations.

The interrogation was expected to last for several hours due to translation issues and “lots of questions” during the interview, according to Andre Marty, a spokesman for the Swiss attorney general’s office.

“The world of football needs to be patient as for the results of this first interrogation,” the spokesman said Wednesday.

""Our staff went to check it out and were surprised to discover that a seal was actually on the runway,"" Meadow Bailey, communications director for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOTPF), told Alaska Dispatch News.

The bearded seal weighed around 450 pounds, according to Bailey. Peacefully lounging on the tarmac, his photo was quickly snapped and circulated by those present.

As much as the DOTPF crew was delighted to meet the chunky seal, the heavy storms that are currently hitting Utqiaġvik escalated the urgency of removing the wild animal from the runway. Bailey said that North Slope Borough Animal Control first arrived with a pickup truck, which didn’t seem like the appropriate tool, so they left and returned with a sled hitched onto a snow machine, Atlas Obscura reports.

“They were able to take the sled onto the runway, and roll the seal onto the sled. They didn’t have to tranquilize it or anything like that,” Bailey said.

Nevertheless, no one on her staff can recall the last time they spotted a seal on the runway.

In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, we fight to understand a murderer's motive. And many times we hear the words 'pure evil' to describe the act of lone gunman Stephen Paddock.

What is evil? Where does it come from? Why if God is good does he allow it?

The bee slayer then flies away with the bee's rear end and leaves the hapless insect's front half scrambling.
""An individual hornet can sit by the entrance to the hive, just crushing the bees,"" Carpenter said.
As for the bee's frantic head in the video, it may be destined to be wasp food, too.","Nature is red in tooth and claw — an adage that applies to the smallest creatures as well as the largest.

Just ask one unfortunate half-bee, who was gnawed in two by a yellowjacket wasp in a new video posted to Reddit by user Iamnotburgerking. The video, posted without additional detail, shows the wasp pinning down and wrestling the bee and then slicing off its abdomen. The bee slayer then flies away with the bee's rear end and leaves the hapless insect's front half scrambling.

It's gross, but not very strange behavior for yellowjackets, which take a wide range of prey, said James Carpenter, curator of Hymenoptera (the group of insects that includes wasps) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The field dressing of the bee isn't unusual, either, Carpenter told Live Science.

""Social wasps cut up prey to make it transportable,"" he said. ""Indeed, sometimes they chew it up into a food ball, getting rid of the appendages."" [Beastly Feasts: Amazing Photos of Animals and Their Prey]

The common name ""yellowjackets"" comprises a large group of predatory wasps. Their large, scissor-like jaws are made for capturing and gnawing on prey. The largest yellowjacket wasps, hornets, are the most frequent predators of bees, Carpenter said. Some species specialize in attacking beehives, he said, making bee raising (apiculture) all but impossible in those wasps' territories.

""An individual hornet can sit by the entrance to the hive, just crushing the bees,"" Carpenter said. Bees can sting, but hornets and other wasps have a size advantage. As such, some colonies defend themselves by mobbing the wasp attacker, Carpenter said, thus raising the wasp's body temperature and killing it via hyperthermia.

Wasps have strange interactions with other insects, as well. In 2011, researchers reported that invasive yellowjackets in New Zealand were doing something never observed before: They were picking up ants that were nosing around their food sources, flying them a few inches away and dropping them. The confused ants would rarely make it back to the food, and the wasps managed to avoid head-to-head battles with the ants, which are capable of spraying acid at attackers.

It may be tempting to root for the poor bee in the Reddit video, but Carpenter said honeybees are actually invasive species in most areas of the world, and their presence disrupts native bees. Yellowjackets, on the other hand, keep many insect pests, including flies and beetle grubs, under control, so they can be a boon for agriculture, Carpenter said.

As for the bee's frantic head in the video, it may be destined to be wasp food, too. Wasps sometimes leave part of their prey and then return for it later, Carpenter said. There is good news for the bee, though: According to research released in April, it seems unlikely that honeybees can feel pain.

“The world has gotten more evil,” said the 57-year-old actor, who co-wrote the film with his wife, Sam. “And this movie is about bringing lightness to the darkness, because dark hates the light.

“People are looking for hope. They are looking for a glimmer of something positive in their lives, because so much negativity happens. Evil, a lot of times, is so hard explain it, why people do the stuff that they do that hurts so many people’s lives.

“And we have fallen apart,” said Sorbo, who starred in the TV series “Hercules” and “Andromeda.” “This country is founded on Judeo-Christian values, and now we are a secular nation and you can see the anger and the hate.”

The movie follows the life journey of its lead character, Dr. Sol Harkens, as he converts to Christianity.

Sorbo said the film follows an atheist who changes his views following a series of traumatic events, including the death of his 8-year-old son and a failed marriage.

“In his private life, he is a pretty miserable guy, and an event (a car accident) happens to him, and he can’t really explain his worldview anymore. And he is torn and lost and the only other person that understands him is his ex-wife. It’s that journey and story of hope, faith and, ultimately, I think it’s a love story and the celebration of the importance of being a father to kids.”

Hannity, the movie’s executive producer, described the film as “a real-life emotional roller coaster ride.”

“This is a story about how one man struggles to find his true identity, his faith and how his decisions in life directly impact [things] all around him. It’s a movie that will touch people in every way possible: mentally, emotionally and spiritually.”

Sorbo said he was honored to work with Hannity.

“Sean is great,” he said. “I’ve golfed with Sean and have known him through the years. He reached out and called me, because he said, ‘I want to do something with you, I like the movies you do.’”

Hannity said the film will have an effect on everyone who sees it.

“If you want to avoid the typical formulaic Hollywood movie model of sex, violence and cartoon characters and watch a movie that can truly impact your life, this is the movie for you and your entire family,” he said.

Russia, Russia, Russia. For months it was all we heard about. The left couldn't get enough of it. They really wanted you to believe that Hillary lost and Trump won because of Russian meddling.

My how times change! Now it's Russia and the Clinton connection. Of course the media refuses to cover and investigate, but there is yet another Clinton scandal here.

Rep. Devon Nunes, R-Calif., Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, is investigating the following:

A Russian backed company wanted to take control of a big chunk of America’s uranium business. They gave millions, $145 million to a Clinton Foundation charity. Bill Clinton got a half million for a speech in Moscow and he met with Vladimir Putin, bingo. Shortly thereafter Hillary’s State Department gives the okay for the Russians to buy our uranium. Is this pay to play? “Baloney,"" says Hillary.

Wait...there's more on the Russia/Clinton connection. The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee paid for the Russian ""dossier.” They bought, they funded, and they instigated, a so-called ""report"" on Donald Trump. Of course it was full of salacious and totally unproven dirt. Back then, the Clinton people denied any knowledge, and took great offense at the mere suggestion they knew anything about it.

Times change.

Two points: first, Democrats may regret their Russia, Russia, Russia campaign. Former president Jimmy Carter says the Russians had little, if any, impact on the election. And now the Russia investigation has veered off-course to bring in the Clintons.

And second, the Democrats will surely regret the continuing presence of Hillary Clinton. She lost. She's mired in scandal, again. And she won't go away.

A few months ago, it was Trump and the Republicans getting unwanted attention. Now it’s Hillary, Bill and the Democrats.

Again, things change fast.

Ultimately, Equation Group hacking tools ended up in the hands of a group known as the Shadow Brokers, which reportedly has links to Russia.
The archive was then uploaded to Kaspersky Lab for analysis, and was found to contain an arsenal of hacking tools.
Retailers such as Best Buy have also dropped Kaspersky Lab products from store shelves.
In response, Kaspersky Lab has offered up an independent review of the company's source code for flaws.","Embattled security firm Kaspersky Lab said its antivirus software did download secret hacking tools from a US computer back in 2014, but deleted them after realizing the data was classified.

""The archive was deleted from all our systems. The archive was not shared with any third parties,"" Kaspersky Lab said on Tuesday.

The Moscow-based security firm has been fighting accusations that its antivirus software helped Russian spies steal confidential files from the US National Security Agency. On Tuesday, Kaspersky Lab tried to clear the air, and said its antivirus software did indeed download the secret hacking files, but only because they were flagged as malware after an NSA contractor's home computer was reportedly infected.

""US law tolerates inadvertent acquisition of classified data, but doesn't allow to distribute it. We deleted it to follow the law,"" the company's CEO Eugene Kaspersky tweeted on Wednesday. The Russian security firm added: ""Kaspersky Lab has never created any detection of non-weaponized (non-malicious) documents in its products based on keywords like 'top secret' and 'classified'.""

In a statement, the security firm provided a timeline detailing how Kaspersky Lab came across the classified files, which seems to point the finger at the careless behavior of the NSA contractor.

In 2014, Kaspersky was investigating a shadowy hacking group called Equation, which experts now believe is actually the NSA. Ultimately, Equation Group hacking tools ended up in the hands of a group known as the Shadow Brokers, which reportedly has links to Russia.

As part of its investigation into the Equation Group, Kaspersky's antivirus software detected some unknown malicious code in a 7-zip archive on a US home computer. The archive was then uploaded to Kaspersky Lab for analysis, and was found to contain an arsenal of hacking tools.

According to Kaspersky Lab, the computer in question at one point downloaded and installed pirated software that contained a separate piece of malware called ""Backdoor.Win32.Mokes.hvl."" Kaspersky's software flagged it as malicious. However, to get the pirated software to run, the computer's user disabled Kaspersky's antivirus product. The computer was then infected with a backdoor that Kaspersky Lab says can give a hacker remote control over the system.

Kaspersky Lab isn't sure how long the computer was infected with the backdoor. But its software first detected its presence on Oct. 4 2014, with a final detection on Nov. 17 of that year. It's also unclear who may have been in control of the backdoor.

Jake Williams, founder of US cybersecurity firm Rendition InfoSec, said ""I think the story Kaspersky has laid out is completely plausible.""

It'll be up to the US government to back up its own claims against Kaspersky, he added. ""And they need to back their claims with data, not just accusations,"" Williams said.

Many of the accusations against Kaspersky have come from media reports that largely cite anonymous sources. Nevertheless, the US Department of Homeland Security is forcing federal agencies to stop using the company's antivirus software. Retailers such as Best Buy have also dropped Kaspersky Lab products from store shelves.

In response, Kaspersky Lab has offered up an independent review of the company's source code for flaws.

Oh Suk Kwon, 73, a South Korea immigrant who came to the U.S. back in the 1970s and served four years as a fleet mechanic in the U.S. army, bought a gas station in Maryland in 2007 following decades of work at an electrical plant as an auto mechanic.

“When I came to the United States, I had to do something for the country,” he told the Washington Post. He later became a U.S. citizen.

Following an honorable discharge, he continued pursuing the American dream, telling the paper: “My whole life was work, work, work.”

But just several years after opening the gas station, IRS investigators seized all the station’s cash – more than $59,000 – leaving the Kwon family cash-strapped, even though no evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found by the government, the paper reported.

After the IRS investigation ended, the station went bankrupt, Kwon’s wife passed away, and the IRS changed its policy regarding seizures like this; but the agency is still refusing to hand back Kwon his money.

His problems with the IRS started in 2011 when investigators showed up at his doorstep accusing him making money deposits in increments of less than $10,000 – a practice known as “structuring.""

Structuring is commonly used by terror groups in order to avoid scrutiny. The government requires banks to report all transactions larger than $10,000 under the 1970 Banking Secrecy Act.

""They did it for money, and they destroyed a good and honest man. It is shameful."" - Attorney Edward Griffin

“Of all the cases I have worked on, this one stands out for me,” Kwon’s attorney Edward Griffin told The Post. “I firmly believe that the government did wrong in choosing to prosecute Mr. Kwon and seize his assets. There was no good policy purpose for the prosecution. They did it for money, and they destroyed a good and honest man. It is shameful. Which is why I am still fighting for him.”

A spokesman for the IRS said Kwon pleaded guilty to the structuring charge. Kwon said he merely followed the advice given by a local bank, which suggested making smaller deposits to avoid paperwork.

He told the paper the guilty plea ruined his life. He said he also felt shame after the investigators spoke with his neighbors, forcing him later to move out of the neighborhood.

“They saw me as Korean. As a veteran,” he told The Post. “They were surprised to see me as a criminal. I will never forget that.”

It remains unclear whether he will get his money back. His attorney petitioned the IRS and Department of Justice this summer, but the request to hand back the money was not granted, citing lack of “additional information.”",Report: IRS refuses to give back $59G to vet after seizing his business cash,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/17/report-irs-refuses-to-give-back-59g-to-vet-after-seizing-his-business-cash.html

A restaurant called Under, which is slated to open near the Norwegian village of Båly, will become Europe’s first underwater restaurant upon opening in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2018. Situated on the country’s southern coast, the structure that houses the restaurant will straddle both the land and the sea — the entrance being at the water’s edge, and the dining area installed on the ocean floor.

“More than an aquarium, the structure will become a part of its marine environment, coming to rest directly on the sea bed five meters below the water's surface,” writes Snøhetta, the architecture firm designing the restaurant.

The restaurant itself will be comprised of three levels, according to Snøhetta. The first is more or less a lobby, or “wardrobe area.” A “Champagne bar” is located one level down, decorated with “subdued” colors evocative of “shells, rocks and sand.” Dining tables are located on the lowest level, which also boasts muted lighting, a blue-and-green color scheme and a panoramic window overlooking the aquatic life on the seabed.

The restaurant floor can accommodate between 80 and 100 diners.

14 CLASSIC AMERICAN DRIVE-INS THAT ARE STILL IN OPERATION

In order to withstand the waves of the North Atlantic Sea, Under’s concrete walls will be 1 meter thick, according to Snøhetta. The exterior of the structure, which somewhat resembles a large shipping container, will also feature a “coarse surface that invites mussels to cling on,” and ultimately serve as an artificial reef, they write.

In addition, the designers of Under are hoping to impart a learning experience on diners, with informational plaques positioned along a pathway to the restaurant’s entrance. Snøhetta further claims the structure will also function as a ""research center for marine life,” though they do not elaborate.

Despite being Europe’s first underwater restaurant, Under is by no means the first underwater eatery in the world. Similar underwater dining experiences are currently available for patrons in the Maldives, Dubai and Israel.

Russia, Russia, Russia. For months it was all we heard about. The left couldn't get enough of it. They really wanted you to believe that Hillary lost and Trump won because of Russian meddling.

My how times change! Now it's Russia and the Clinton connection. Of course the media refuses to cover and investigate, but there is yet another Clinton scandal here.

Rep. Devon Nunes, R-Calif., Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, is investigating the following:

A Russian backed company wanted to take control of a big chunk of America’s uranium business. They gave millions, $145 million to a Clinton Foundation charity. Bill Clinton got a half million for a speech in Moscow and he met with Vladimir Putin, bingo. Shortly thereafter Hillary’s State Department gives the okay for the Russians to buy our uranium. Is this pay to play? “Baloney,"" says Hillary.

Wait...there's more on the Russia/Clinton connection. The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee paid for the Russian ""dossier.” They bought, they funded, and they instigated, a so-called ""report"" on Donald Trump. Of course it was full of salacious and totally unproven dirt. Back then, the Clinton people denied any knowledge, and took great offense at the mere suggestion they knew anything about it.

Times change.

Two points: first, Democrats may regret their Russia, Russia, Russia campaign. Former president Jimmy Carter says the Russians had little, if any, impact on the election. And now the Russia investigation has veered off-course to bring in the Clintons.

And second, the Democrats will surely regret the continuing presence of Hillary Clinton. She lost. She's mired in scandal, again. And she won't go away.

A few months ago, it was Trump and the Republicans getting unwanted attention. Now it’s Hillary, Bill and the Democrats.

Again, things change fast.

""Seeing my buddies that are in the Cup level now ... we all raced together.","Darrell Wallace Jr. will become the first black full-time driver at NASCAR's top level since 1971 when he takes over Richard Petty's iconic ride next season.

The 24-year-old Wallace, more commonly referred to by his nickname of ""Bubba,"" became the first black driver to race at NASCAR's top level since 2006 when he replaced an injured Aric Almirola earlier this year. At the time, Petty recalled, he wasn't sure he wanted Wallace as a replacement.

""We went round and round when Aric got hurt about who we was going to put in the car,"" Petty said Wednesday. ""Bubba had been running some races and stuff. He was bad about wrecking, I thought, so we had to have a little talk with him, say, 'You know, just go out and finish the races and stuff.'""

In other words, race wasn't an issue.

""That was the least of my considerations,"" Petty said. ""We looked at the talent. We looked at how we thought he handled the fans, how he handled the press, how he handled sponsor deals, all this kind of stuff. I didn't care what color he was, where he come from, any of that. If you look back at the Petty history and stuff, we've had a driver from Brazil that drove for us for a while, one from Mexico that drove a Truck race for us. It's not anything different than what we've done before.""

Petty, a seven-time champion and Hall of Famer, recently made headlines for saying he would fire any Richard Petty Motorsport employee who kneeled during the national anthem. Such displays have become a familiar sight at NFL games as African-American players kneel to protest social injustices.

Wallace, an Alabama native and graduate of NASCAR's diversity program, has tried not to make race part of his climb through the ranks.

He won the Truck Series race at Martinsville in 2013 to become the first black driver to win at a national NASCAR series event since Wendell Scott in 1963. NASCAR says there have been at least seven black drivers in its series previous to Wallace, including Scott, who raced from 1961-73 in Cup, Willy T. Ribbs, who did three Cup races in 1986, and Bill Lester, who raced sporadically from 1999 until 2007 at all three national levels.

""There's been a lot of people who have come up through the ranks and tried to carry on the legacy that Wendell Scott had laid down for us,"" Wallace said. ""For me to step in that realm and take on that role, there's a lot of pressure.

""But we're going to go out there and just continue to do what we do on and off the racetrack, that's to represent the brand of myself and Richard Petty and his image the best way I can, continue to grow together.""

Wallace stressed that patience has been critical in his slow move up toward Cup, but that his climb hasn't been much different than current Cup newcomers Ryan Blaney, Chase Elliott, Corey LaJoie, and Austin and Ty Dillon.

""Everybody has different ways of getting to the level that I can now say that I'm at,"" he said. ""Seeing my buddies that are in the Cup level now ... we all raced together. We were all 10, 11, 12 years old running against each other here at Charlotte Motor Speedway, beating and banging with each other. Now we're at the top level. Each and every one of us have a different story of how we've gotten there.""

""Our staff went to check it out and were surprised to discover that a seal was actually on the runway,"" Meadow Bailey, communications director for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOTPF), told Alaska Dispatch News.

The bearded seal weighed around 450 pounds, according to Bailey. Peacefully lounging on the tarmac, his photo was quickly snapped and circulated by those present.



SOUTHWEST'S DANCING EMPLOYEE IS A SOCIAL MEDIA SENSATION

As much as the DOTPF crew was delighted to meet the chunky seal, the heavy storms that are currently hitting Utqiaġvik escalated the urgency of removing the wild animal from the runway. Bailey said that North Slope Borough Animal Control first arrived with a pickup truck, which didn’t seem like the appropriate tool, so they left and returned with a sled hitched onto a snow machine, Atlas Obscura reports.

“They were able to take the sled onto the runway, and roll the seal onto the sled. They didn’t have to tranquilize it or anything like that,” Bailey said.

While the Wiley Post-Will Rogers Memorial Airport is roughly a quarter-mile away from the ocean, DOTPF staffers believe that the seal traveled about a mile to get to the runway.

US-BOUND FLIGHTS GET TOUGHER SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR PASSENGERS

And since Alaska is home to 282 land-based airports, Bailey described the state's hundreds of runways as “really just part of the landscape,” adding that they have “a lot” of wildlife, from musk oxen to caribou, polar bears and birds alike. Nevertheless, no one on her staff can recall the last time they spotted a seal on the runway.

Gone just as quickly as he had arrived, the seal did not hold up any flights, either.

For the past year, I’ve been using the Google Home speaker to ask Google questions about my daily activities. I’ve asked about the weather, inquired about directions to a local pizza place, and tried to find recipes for blueberry pancakes. Nothing too major. A few times, my wife would ask Google about store hours at Costco and to find out about political news.

This week, I found out that Google records every one of those questions.

Using the My Activity portal, you can also find out everything about your life. Did you ask about the Miami Dolphins, or President Trump, or ask for directions to the cleaners? It’s all there. Did you also ask Google about a local meeting of alt-right conspiracy theorists? Inquire about cancer treatments? Look-up places that sell sex robots? It’s all recorded.

GOOGLE'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTER 'NO LONGER CONSTRAINED BY LIMITS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE'

It’s also a bit startling, because you hear your own voice, recorded as far back as a year ago. And, while Google reps claim this is something users have to agree to during setup, it’s a little-known option called Voice and Audio Activity. Even if you disabled the option to save your internet history in Chrome, you’re likely still being tracked in My Activity.

It saves every movie you watch, the music you listen to, every YouTube video you find, all of your image searches, and just about everything you do online. (If you use Incognito mode in the Chrome browser, none of that activity is saved. You can also disable My Activity logging.)

To hear your own voice, just visit the My Activity site. It also saves all of your internet browsing history for some reason, even if you have that disabled in the Chrome browser.

The recordings and activity are saved every time you use the Google Assistant voicebot on your phone and in the Google Allo app, not just when you use the Google Home speaker.

GOOGLE PHOTOS WILL NOW RECOGNIZE YOUR PETS

“Google’s MyActivity portal is both a blessing and a curse,” Richard Henderson, a global security strategist at security firm Absolute, told Fox News. “It’s a blessing because it really does provide a ‘one-stop shop’ of all your activity across all your various Google properties, like your Android phone, your browsing and Gmail, as well as the Google Home assistant. But it’s also a curse because it really demonstrates the level of data that many massive technology companies collect in order for them to profit.”

Henderson says users are typically not aware that they are being recorded. Worse yet, if you do disable the voice recording, it “neuters” the speaker or other devices that rely on Google Assistant for voice commands. (Google reps confirmed this but said the speaker can still stream music.) There’s no way of knowing how the recordings are saved and used, he says.

Earlier this month, a reporter at Android Police discovered that a new Google Home Mini speaker was recording not just his own phrases when he said the “OK Google” hotword but everything being said at all times. Google permanently immediately resolved the bug.

GOOGLE PARENT ALPHABET TURNS ON INTERNET BALLOONS IN PUERTO RICO

Amazon Echo speakers also record everything you say. The problem with voice-activated products is that they tend to obscure the privacy policies or list them only in an app.

“These devices require the user to opt-in to voice control or, with devices like the Amazon Echo, only listen for control words, such as ""Alexa,"" and only start recording once they hear the control word,” says Andrew Howard, chief technology officer at Kudelski Security, told Fox News. “The challenge for consumers is that these devices can change their policies, often quietly, and it is impossible to confirm compliance with the stated privacy policies. Generally, consumers should use these new capabilities with a bit of caution.”

Google reps released a statement to Fox News about this issue:

“Google only stores voice-based queries received after recognizing the hotword. Hotword detection runs locally on the device and if the hotword is not detected, the audio snippet stays local on the device and is discarded. If the hotword is recognized, the data, including the query contents, are sent to Google servers for analyzing and storage in My Activity.”",Google is recording everything you say to a bot -- right now,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/26/google-is-recording-everything-say-to-bot-right-now.html

Brinkley also explains how General Jackson's ability to not think in racial terms enabled him to build a large, diverse army leading to the decisive victory in the War of 1812 that solidified the Louisiana Purchase as being American territory and saved America.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

A low libido can happen at any point in your life for a variety of reasons. Studies show that 32 percent of women and 15 percent of men lack the desire to have sex regularly. A few potential causes of a decreased sex drive could be due to depression, stress, obesity or certain medications.

Rather than heading out to purchase new lingerie, a trip to the nearest grocery store might help. Not only does eating healthy foods help you feel better about yourself, and in turn boost your confidence, a healthy diet can also increase your mood, energy levels and stamina, which all contribute to boosting your libido. In addition to an overall healthy diet, research shows specific foods and nutrients can help sizzle things up in the bedroom. Be sure to include these five foods in your diet to supercharge your sex drive.

Avocados

A source of vitamin E for healthy skin and nails, avocados also provide potassium, vitamin B6 and monounsaturated fats for a healthy heart and circulation, which is critical for an active sex life. Studies show men with heart disease are twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction as both conditions can result from artery damage. Try some mashed avocado on your toast in the morning, or add slices to your sandwich or salad.

Chocolate (and Cocoa Powder)

One of the most popular foods for its indulgent flavor, chocolate can help boost your mood by increasing both dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, also known as your ""feel good” neurotransmitters. In addition, chocolate offers varying amounts of flavanols (a naturally occurring antioxidant in cocoa) that helps relax blood vessels and increase blood flow. Since the amount (and therefore benefits) of cocoa flavanols vary greatly in chocolate depending on the brand and how it’s processed, it’s best to get your cocoa flavanols from unsweetened cocoa powder or a fortified powder from a major manufacturer that guarantees at least 200 mg in a serving.

Fatty Fish

You may have heard that fatty fish like tuna, sardines and salmon are swimming with omega-3 fatty acids, which are not only good for your heart but also raise levels of dopamine in the brain that improve circulation and blood flow. Fish is also high in protein and a good source of vitamin B-6, which aids in healthy blood production. For example, just one ¼ cup serving of wild-caught Bumble Bee Solid White Albacore Tuna provides nearly 25 percent of your daily need for protein and 10 percent of your daily need for vitamin B-6, along with omega-3 fatty acids. Who knew a tuna fish sandwich could put you in the mood?

Green Tea

Could a hot cup of tea heat up your sex life? Green tea is rich in compounds called catechins, which in addition to helping reduce belly fat has been shown to help promote blood flow for a better sex life. Catechins promote blood flow in two ways. First, they kill off free radicals that damage and inflame blood vessels, increasing their ability to transport blood. Second, they cause blood vessel cells to release nitric oxide, which increases the size of the blood vessels, leading to improved blood flow. In addition to a hot mug of green tea, try adding it in your morning oatmeal, blend up a green tea smoothie or add some green tea powder to your yogurt or baked goods.

Pumpkin Seeds

One of the best plant sources of zinc, pumpkin seeds (or papitas) also contain protein, fiber, potassium and iron. Important for immune function, wound healing and eye health, zinc also plays a role in a man’s sex drive as having a zinc deficiency can lead to low testosterone. While it’s not exactly understood why a lack of zinc impacts testosterone, the mineral may affect the cells in the testes that produce testosterone. One study found that men who received 30 milligrams of zinc per day showed increased levels of free testosterone in their bodies. Enjoy pumpkin seeds for a snack, or add them to your salad or cooked grains for a little crunch.",5 foods to increase your libido,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/26/5-foods-to-increase-your-libido.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds.

The president's touting of Gillespie was yet another public sharing of support for the establishment candidate.

“Ed Gillespie will turn the really bad Virginia economy #’s around, and fast. Strong on crime, he might even save our great statues/heritage!” Trump tweeted, pointing to the many historic statues in Virginia that are at risk of tear-down after the violent riots in Charlottesville last summer.

Gillespie, who served as the chair of the Republican National Committee, and as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years, was joined by Vice President Mike Pence at a rally earlier this month.

VIRGINIA GOVERNOR RACE: WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?

“Ed Gillespie will be a great Governor of Virginia. His opponent doesn’t even show up to meetings/work, and will be VERY weak on crime!” Trump tweeted just minutes later.

Gillespie is up against current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s lieutenant governor, Democrat Ralph Northam. Northam was expected to govern the commonwealth just as McAuliffe has.

Northam is for stronger gun control and abortion rights, and promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,” according to his campaign website.

Both Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden have been on the campaign trail, fundraising or campaigning with Northam. Former President Obama also campaigned with him earlier this month.

But despite the Democrats rallying around Northam, the president warned not to “underestimate unity” in the GOP.

“Do not underestimate the UNITY within the Republican Party!” Trump tweeted minutes later, piggy-backing on his comments from the day earlier.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

By following it now with a sustained diplomatic initiative, her visit can be the beginning of the end of South Sudan’s nightmare.","U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, arrived in South Sudan this week amidst a political, security, and humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions: A country engulfed in civil war that is hemorrhaging more refugees than any African state since the Rwandan genocide and where two-thirds of the population is starving.

To her great credit, Haley delivered an unequivocal message to the brutal regime led by President Salva Kiir: The U.S. has lost its trust in South Sudan’s government. The United States must now act to provide the African Union and the United Nations with the necessary leverage to broker an end to the conflict.

History suggests that successful negotiated settlements to other civil wars have depended on the parties recognizing that they cannot prevail militarily. However, the absence of a UN arms embargo on South Sudan; the fragmentation of the opposition; and the failure of the guarantors and witnesses of a 2015 peace agreement, including the United States, to impose any meaningful consequences for violations of that agreement have ceded military dominance to Kiir’s regime.

This dominance has entrenched a belief in South Sudan’s capital, Juba, that the opposition can be neutralized by force, leaving little incentive for compromise. Fortunately, the United States and other Western governments have several non-violent leverage points to create a new context for a more successful mediation effort.

First, by renouncing its support for a failed 2015 agreement that the South Sudanese regime has co-opted, the United States can set the stage for a new diplomatic push. In doing so, it would be standing in solidarity with nearly two dozen South Sudanese civil society leaders who recently called for a “less politicized, more technocratic leadership.” The United States could then work with its international partners, including South Sudan’s neighbors, to orchestrate a negotiated exit for the morally bankrupt elite that is squandering—not defending—South Sudan’s sovereignty.

Second, while efforts by the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan have stalled, the regime’s main weapons suppliers are not shadowy arms dealers but key security partners of the United States: Uganda, Egypt, and Ukraine. The United States and its allies must deploy their unique leverage on these governments to end their complicity with the regime’s atrocities. Uganda in particular is both the main transit point for arms and ammunition for Kiir’s forces and the largest recipient of U.S. security assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United States can make clear that it will no longer tolerate the contradiction whereby Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni empowers Kiir’s regime on the one hand and is then applauded for hosting the more than one million refugees fleeing that same regime—all while the United States spends nearly $1 billion a year for the humanitarian response.

Third, building on Haley’s statements this week, African and Western governments must shift the international consensus on the legitimacy of Kiir’s government, which is questionable at best. A public signal now from the United States that it is de-recognizing the regime and downgrading its diplomatic status could alter calculations in Juba and generate an urgency for compromise, not least because de-recognition would call into question Kiir’s privileges and immunities as a sitting head of state. De-recognizing the government does not imply de-recognition of the independent state for which South Sudanese fought and died bravely for decades or of their right to self-determination; the sovereignty of the state is vested in its citizens, however, not in a regime that multiple international bodies have found responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

President Trump’s decision to dispatch Haley to east Africa is a welcome, if nascent, indication of the administration’s intention to address the magnitude of South Sudan’s implosion.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit.

Judge Reggie B. Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia also said the IRS must provide information about which groups were targeted and why, along with a strategy to make sure such targeting doesn't happen again.

The IRS is involved in multiple lawsuits with conservative groups related to the Tea Party targeting scandal; this particular case involves True the Vote.

“We’re thrilled the judge has taken this step and it feels good to have it recognized that they need to be held to account,” True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht told Fox News on Monday. “What happened to me was very personal—my name was thrown around the IRS, and the names of the people involved need to be known. What they did was criminal.”

The targeting scandal drew much attention in 2013 when the IRS, headed at the time by Lois Lerner, admitted it was applying extra scrutiny to conservative groups applying for nonprofit status.

“That was wrong,” Lerner said at the time in the press. “That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. ... The IRS would like to apologize for that.”

But director of investigations and research at Judicial Watch Chris Farrell, whose organization is also involved in litigation with the IRS on this issue, told Fox News that the IRS owes litigants “real accountability.”

“This was creepy, chilling stuff,” Farrell told Fox News. “Judge Walton has accomplished more with one ruling than all of the rest of the federal government—all three branches—over the last six years.”

Farrell added: “The IRS is one of the most feared government agencies, and they’ve gotten a pass, in part. Walton is looking for real accountability and that’s so important.”

At a hearing last week, Walton told IRS attorneys that it was time to “lay it on the line. Put it out there,” according to The Washington Times.

""We are reviewing the order and will respond accordingly,"" a Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News Monday. Justice Department attorneys are representing the IRS in the suit.

“We do not comment on pending litigation,” a spokesperson for the IRS told Fox News on Monday.

Engelbrecht told Fox News that “the fight” under the Trump administration has been “every bit as difficult” as it was under the Obama administration.

“They are still entrenched on the idea that the IRS did nothing wrong and all of America now knows that is not the case,” Engelbrecht said. “What we’re fighting for is we want to see a policy that prohibits viewpoint discrimination. Holding the IRS accountable and personalizing it is a great step forward to coax each one out of their den of thieves.”

Engelbrecht added: “We are fighting on behalf of all Americans, because if it could happen to us, it can happen to anyone.”

Walton ordered the IRS to search for further records, according to The Washington Times, in other agency databases for the time period spanning 2009 to March 27, 2015.

“Furthermore, to the extent that the plaintiffs have already received information produced by the government indicating that the plaintiffs were allegedly discriminated against, and that information provides a basis to believe that other such documents exist, the government must search all relevant sources to ensure that all documents responsive to the document request is identified and produced,” the judge wrote in his order.

Here’s one top takeaway from network news coverage in 2017: Sneaky Russian influence in American politics is a huge story if it involves Republicans/Donald Trump, but a non-story if it involves Democrats/Hillary Clinton.

MRC analysts have been tracking all evening news coverage of the Trump administration since Inauguration Day. From Inauguration Day, January 20, through last Friday, October 20, these broadcasts have aired an astonishing 1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.

Last week, The Hill published new information about Russian efforts to infiltrate the American uranium industry, including $31.3 million in payments to the Clinton Foundation, as well as a huge speaking fee delivered to Bill Clinton personally, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. In eight days, the network evening news coverage of this story amount to a mere 20 seconds on ABC’s World News Tonight.

According to an October 22 story by The Hill’s John Solomon and Alison Spann, FBI agents “were surprised by the timing and size of a $500,000 check that a Kremlin-linked bank provided Bill Clinton with for a single speech in the summer of 2010.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.
In math, 79 percent of Edina high school students were performing at grade level in 2014, while only 66 percent are today.
Every American, in every state should make sure their elected school officials are focused on education – not political indoctrination.","Headlines about left-wing college students engaging in radical, sometimes racially charged protests are becoming all too common.

In October 2016, students at University of California, Berkeley created a human chain in an attempt to block white students from going to class.

This past May, students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington demanded – in the name of racial equity – that white students stay home from school for a day. These students shouted down faculty who disagreed with them, and the dispute led to multiple protests that eventually forced the college to hold its commencement ceremony 30 miles away from campus.

These stories are outrageous, but unfortunately, nothing new. Universities have been a hotbed for left-wing activism for decades. In fact, Ronald Reagan ran for Governor of California in 1966 promising to crack down on the rioting and radicalism at Berkeley.

This sudden decline in performance is what happens when educators think it is their job to impose their political views on students.

A recent story out of Minnesota, however, suggests that the left is now bringing this same radicalism to K-12 public education, and the ones suffering are the young students, who are in their most impressionable years.

Katherine Kersten, founding director and Senior Policy Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, recently wrote about liberal policy and curriculum changes made by Edina school system officials in Minnesota that are causing the once celebrated school system to slip.

The school system itself adopted a so-called “All for All” policy in 2013 which all students “will acquire an awareness of their own cultural identity and value racial, cultural, and ethnic diversities so as to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds.”

This may sound innocent, even laudable. But the implementation of this policy shows it is merely a thinly veiled attempt to instill radical, left-wing political views in impressionable children.

According to Kersten, grade school-aged students in the Edina system are learning the alphabet by reading a book called A is for Activist.

As the title suggests, it’s a left-wing “ABC” book that teaches children concepts such as C stands for “Creative Counter to Corporate vultures,” “F is for Feminist,” “T is for Trans” – you get the idea.

The book’s own description describes it as being “written and illustrated for the next generation of progressives: families who want their kids to grow up in a space that is unapologetic about activism, environmental justice, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and everything else that activists believe in and fight for.”

This is pure, unapologetic political indoctrination of American youth. Imagine the outrage among educators if young students were assigned a book designed to create the next generation of conservatives.

The indoctrination continues throughout the student experience in the school system.

An 11th grade U.S. Literature and Composition teacher in the Edina system instructs students in her syllabus that by the end of the school year, they will have, “learned how to apply marxist [sic], feminist, post-colonial, psychoanalytic, reader response, and aesthetic lenses to literature.” Notice the absence of any sort of conservative or traditionalist lens.

A high school in the system offered a course called “Race, Racism, and Whiteness” as an elective during its May term in the 2016-2017 school year. The school system superintendent later denied offering such a course, but the Center of the American Experiment found proof.

When President Trump was elected, Kersten writes that the entire school system went into hysteria. Teachers were openly crying in class the day after the election, and one reportedly told students that “Trump winning is worse than 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.”

Many students who don’t conform to the liberal leanings of the faculty reported being afraid to express their opinions, and after the election, some requested to be picked up early from school for fear of being berated for their views.

Unsurprisingly, when the school system began to focus on left-wing indoctrination and intimidation instead of the fundamentals of education, student performance began to slip.

Citing Minnesota Department of Education statistics, Kersten reported that the percentage of students attending Edina High School who met state standards for reading dropped from 86 percent in 2014 to 79 percent in 2017. In math, 79 percent of Edina high school students were performing at grade level in 2014, while only 66 percent are today.

The high school used to be fifth in the state for reading scores, now it’s 29th. It used to be 10th in math proficiency, now it’s 40th.

Several listeners of the Todd Starnes Radio Show alerted us to the massive public display of patriotism. They pointed out the significant difference between how high school football players treat the flag and how professional football players treat the flag.

“The kids have been frustrated with what's going on across the country with players taking a knee,” head coach Todd Mather told the Todd Starnes Show. “I told the kids that politics don't have a place in high school sports. I told them we stand for the national anthem. That's what you do as an American in this country.""

And that's exactly what they did at Friday night's homecoming game -- bringing the audience to tears.

""There wasn't a dry eye in the stands - including myself,"" the coach said.

At the conclusion of the song, the game announcer told the crowd they were living in the “best country on the face of this Earth.”

“At Burroughs football game – we are standing,” he declared. “We are standing for the national anthem.”

Parent Tina Haugen filmed the incredible moment.

""It was absolutely amazing,"" she said. ""Our community is unbelievably patriotic. Everybody was clapping and cheering.""

The young men on the football team and the good citizens of Ridgecrest should be commended for their public display of patriotism.

They reminded the nation that there are plenty of folks across the fruited plain who are proud to be Americans.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

These triplets are competitive as well. Despite being blind, they actually love to play video games. But on this day, it’s not video games they are playing, but it’s video that is making their world a bit clearer.

With the help of Aira smart glasses and a customer support representative, these brothers are getting a sense of what is going on all around them thanks to new amazing technology made specifically for the blind. The representative, also known as a trained agent, describes to the user of the glasses what they are seeing in real-time.

The brothers are being given a free year subscription to the software as they get ready to head off to college next year. They thought the glasses were cool as they got a chance to hear what their eyes cannot see.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.
Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

The Hill recently reported that Russian officials engaged in a “racketeering scheme” to further its energy goals in the U.S.What was the Uranium One deal?
In 2013, Rosatom, backed by the Russian state, acquired a Canadian uranium mining company, now called Uranium One, which has assets in the U.S.
Through the deal, Russia is able to own about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity.
“Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn’t want to follow!” the president tweeted on Oct. 19.","Multiple congressional committees are investigating an Obama-era deal that resulted in a Russian company purchasing American uranium mines.

And after the request from many Republican lawmakers, the Department of Justice has lifted a gag order on a former FBI informant who is expected to have more information about the agreement that allowed Russia to control about one-fifth of the uranium mining in the U.S. – and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s involvement in it.

President Trump specifically requested the Justice Department lift the gag order on the informant, a source told Fox News.

The informant will be allowed to speak with the Senate Judiciary Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Justice Department said Wednesday night. The informant will be able to provide “any information or documents he has concerning alleged corruption or bribery involving transactions in the uranium market,” the department said.

The controversial sale of what is now Uranium One to a Russian company is what Trump has called the “real Russia story” as federal investigators continue to probe Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 election. The Hill recently reported that Russian officials engaged in a “racketeering scheme” to further its energy goals in the U.S.

What was the Uranium One deal?

In 2013, Rosatom, backed by the Russian state, acquired a Canadian uranium mining company, now called Uranium One, which has assets in the U.S. Uranium is key to making nuclear weapons.

Through the deal, Russia is able to own about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. However, Colin Chilcoat, an energy affairs specialist who has written extensively about Russia's energy deals, said that the company only extracts about 11 percent of uranium in the U.S.

The deal also “doesn’t allow for that uranium to be exported at all,” Chilcoat told Fox News. “It’s not like it’s leaving the U.S. or somehow finding its way to more insidious players.”

HILLARY CLINTON’S TOP AIDES STILL BEING PAID BY CAMPAIGN

The agreement was approved by nine government agencies with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency group that reviews how certain foreign investments can impact national security. Clinton’s State Department was one of those agencies, though the former secretary of state told WMUR-TV in 2015 that she was not “personally involved” in the agreement.

Why is it controversial?

Republicans have largely decried the deal, especially as some investors reportedly donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton also received a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia and reportedly met with Vladimir Putin around the time of the deal.

The FBI had looked into the agreement and uncovered that some Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in nefarious dealings, which included extortion, bribery and kickbacks, The Hill reported. Evidence of wrongdoing by Vadim Mikerin, the Russian official overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion in the U.S. who was eventually sentenced to prison, was discovered by the FBI before the deal was approved, according to The Hill.

Author Peter Schweizer – who wrote about the deal in his 2015 book “Clinton Cash” – told Fox News that there is no evidence that the people involved with approving the agreement knew that the FBI had an ongoing investigation into it.

""If anyone colluded for a foreign government in last year’s election, it was the Clinton campaign."" - White House press secretary Sarah Sanders

But Republicans say the whole affair raises serious questions.

“Now it’s the Democrats who have some explaining to do,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. “I hope they will cooperate with the investigation, be forthcoming with the American people and I expect the media to cover these new developments with the same breathless intensity that they have given to this investigation since day one.”

And White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News Tuesday that “if anyone colluded for a foreign government in last year’s election, it was the Clinton campaign [and] the Democrats.”

Trump has often accused the media of not reporting enough on the Uranium One deal.

“Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn’t want to follow!” the president tweeted on Oct. 19.

And in March, Trump asked on social media why the House Intelligence Committee has not launched an investigation into the “Bill and Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia.”

How does this tie in with the other Russia investigation?

Multiple congressional committees as well as the Justice Department are looking into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election – and ties between Russians and Trump’s campaign.

""That's your real Russia story. Not a story where they talk about collusion and there was none. It was a hoax. Your real Russia story is uranium,"" Trump told reporters during a press conference last week.

REPUBLICANS SEE TABLES TURNED AS DEMS FACE FRESH RUSSIA CONTROVERSIES

Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the probe into alleged Russian interference in the election, was the head of the FBI when it investigated Rosatom officials’ extortion and corruption.

""Your real Russia story is uranium."" - President Donald Trump

And the investigation was led by then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director, and then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, now the deputy attorney general, The Hill reported.

Mueller's investigators in the Russia probe report to Rosenstein.

Congressional committees are looking into whether Mueller informed the Obama administration, particularly those tasked with approving the Uranium One deal, prior to CFIUS approval.

MUELLER PROBE EXPANDS TO DEMOCRATIC LOBBYIST TONY PODESTA’S DEALINGS

In her attempt to discredit reports of the controversy surrounding the Uranium One deal, Clinton said Trump and “his allies, including Fox News,” are diverting from the investigation.

“The closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians … the more they want to just throw mud on the wall,” she said Monday. “I’m their favorite target, me and President Obama.”

What happens next?

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had asked the Department of Justice to lift the non-disclosure agreement preventing a federal informant from speaking about the deal.

The informant’s lawyer, Victoria Toensing, has told Fox Business that her client can “tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made.” The informant was prevented from testifying by former attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, according to Toensing.

“Witnesses who want to talk to Congress should not be gagged and threatened with prosecution for talking,” Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement. The Justice Department said Wednesday night that it has lifted the gag order, allowing the informant to discuss the deal with congressional investigators.

During a hearing with Attorney Gen. Jeff Sessions last week, Grassley pressed the former senator on actions the Justice Department might take regarding the deal. Grassley said he’s written several letters to government agencies inquiring if they knew about the FBI probe before they approved of the deal.

Sessions said the Justice Department will take “appropriate” actions but declined to comment specifically on the influence Russian officials might have had on the Obama administration to “smooth the way” for the deal.

“I hear your concerns and they will be reviewed,” Sessions said.

Grassley has called for a special counsel to be appointed to investigate the deal.

Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News that the House Oversight committee’s investigation “could be criminal,” depending on the statute of limitations.

In an interview with Slate, Bourdain claims his female friends in the restaurant world never thought to confide in him about any inappropriate behavior, which he sees as a “personal failing.”

“It’s like, wow, I’ve known some of these women and I’ve known women who’ve had stories like these for years and they’ve said nothing to me. What is wrong with me?” said Bourdain.

“How have I presented myself in such a way as to not give confidence, or why was I not the sort of person people would see as a natural ally here?” he added.

Throughout the course of the interview, Bourdain repeatedly refers to his first book, “Kitchen Confidential,” a memoir about his time in the restaurant industry. After its release, Bourdain said he “happily played the role” of a bad-boy chef who used foul language and did “stupid offensive s---,” despite trying to distance himself from the persona later on.

“I’ve had to ask myself, and I have been for some time, “To what extent in that book did I provide validation to meatheads?”

Bourdain first responded to the allegations against the Besh Restaurant Group on Oct. 21, after the Times-Picayune reported that 25 women had come forward with claims of sexual harassment against male supervisors within the company, as well as Besh himself.

“The beginning of the end of institutionalized Meathead Culture in the restaurant business,” he wrote on Twitter.

Earlier that month, Bourdain also spoke out against Harvey Weinstein after his girlfriend, Italian actress Asia Argento, came forward with her own rape allegations against the Hollywood mogul.

“He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn’t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,” Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan’s Public House, told Fox News. “This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer.”

According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink — which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen.

“He asked me, 'Don’t you know who Bruce Maxwell is?', and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,” Henry claimed.

“I didn’t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I’m going to card them.”

The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant’s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was “no big deal.”

The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen — who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner — also told Fox News that Maxwell’s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth.

“Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,"" the manager said.

""It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,” she said. “Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did. … I can’t believe the story.”

TRUMP DECRIES ‘NO LEADERSHIP IN NFL’ AFTER MORE ANTHEM PROTESTS

Whalen said that of the three men, Maxwell was the only one who produced a valid ID and thus was the only one they served a beer to.

However, Maxwell told TMZ Sports this week — and headlines since have spanned the globe — that the waiter said to him, “You’re the guy who took the knee?” After confirming he was, Maxwell alleged that the waiter then responded, “I voted for Trump, and I stand for everything he stands for,” and then refused to serve him.

This allegedly prompted the councilman, who is a high school friend and is African-American, to approach the restaurant’s manager who then mitigated the situation by putting another waiter on their table.

“We didn’t even discuss Trump. I was working two jobs, I don’t have time for rallies,” Henry continued. “If this all happened a month ago, why suddenly now is he claiming all this now?”

NFL, PLAYERS LEAVE DOOR OPEN ON KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The pro-baseball rookie also claimed to TMZ that he was racially profiled by the server, of which Henry vehemently denies.

“It’s really easy for people to point a finger at Alabama, and that’s what has upset me about this fabrication the most,” Henry noted. “This is one of the best places to live in America, if not the planet. Hearing this was a slap in the face.”

Henry also noted that Maxwell was very polite during the meal, never raising any eyebrows. Whalen said that the men happily paid their bill without objection and left after their meal.

Maxwell became the first and only MLB player to kneel during the national anthem at a game against the Texas Rangers on September 23. He is also the son of a U.S. Army veteran and previously stated that the point of his kneeling was not to disrespect the military, but to draw attention to the “racial divide that is being practiced from the highest power.”

“Unless you’re subjected to it, you won’t feel it,” Maxwell also told TMZ. “I’m very respectful, I’m very educated. And it still happens to this day. And so … that’s the reason I kneel.”

Henry told Fox News that he started at the local restaurant a couple of months ago, but left two weeks ago only because of health issues from working two jobs and now is working only one.

A spokesperson for the Oakland A’s told Fox News that the club has no comment, and that Maxwell stands by his story and is not doing further interviews at this time.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The vote was 216-212, with 20 Republicans, including conservatives unhappy about deficits and debt, opposing it. Republicans could lose only 22 votes for it to pass.

“Big news - Budget just passed!” President Trump tweeted Thursday morning.

The Senate passed the measure last week and the House endorsed it without changes.

“Tax reform will help reignite the American dream,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters after the vote. “It will help bring us back to a place of confidence, freedom, happiness and a stronger, healthier economy. And this budget that the House just passed, 20 minutes ago, brings us closer to making that dream a reality.”

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas announced that the text of the tax bill will be released Nov. 1.

“By passing this budget today, House Republicans just provided the legislative runway for pro-growth tax reform,” Brady said. “Our successful vote will allow us to move forward quickly on delivering the first overhaul of America’s tax code in more than three decades.”

Brady also said the Ways and Means Committee will consider the legislation in a committee markup beginning Nov. 6. A markup session is where the committee goes through the bill line by line and revamps the package before advancing it to the floor.

The tax bill is the top item on the GOP agenda and would be Trump's first major win in Congress.

The goal is a full rewrite of the inefficient, loophole-laden tax code in hopes of lower rates for corporations and other businesses and a spurt of economic growth.

Brady told reporters on Wednesday morning that he's still looking at curtailing tax-free deposits in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could raise revenue in the near term as retirement savings shift to Roth-style accounts that are funded with after-tax earnings.

Trump says he opposes curbing 401(k) donations, however, which tossed a monkey wrench into the process.

Key decisions about tax brackets, including a new bracket for high-income earners, remain up in the air. Outcomes on other provisions are unsettled as well, lending a sense of chaos as GOP leaders rush to fulfill a goal of passing the measure through the House before Thanksgiving.

Republicans view passage of the tax measure as a career-defining dream, and its importance has only grown in the wake of the party's debacle on health care.

Feldman has alleged in the past that Haim was raped at age 11 by a powerful person in Hollywood and the experience led to Haim's drug addiction issues. Feldman’s pal and “Lost Boys” costar died in 2010 at 38 from pneumonia.

Now, Feldman wants to produce a film self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed on Wednesday he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The deal follows reports that Kaepernick is exploring the possibility of writing a book and was “taking meetings” with book publishers in New York on Tuesday.

It remains unclear what the book will be about.

Multiple NFL teams’ coaches have dismissed the opportunity to sign the athlete, with many suggesting it is due to the negative reception of his political activism among NFL fans.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

Shortly after Inauguration Day, Eli’sha Davies, 9, learned that the president was taking a big salary cut in his new job. So he decided to send him $3 to help him pay his bills, WGRZ reported.

The story gained attention after Trump wrote him back this week, reportedly sending a letter, a picture, and the $3, urging Davies to put it towards bettering his community.

But Davies’ mother told reporters that the money was actually meant to go towards a new mandolin the boy had been saving for, WGRZ reported. But he was having trouble because he kept finding people he thought needed the money more than he did, like the president.

The Young Musicians Education Foundation Inc. is a local charity that helps kids get access to instruments who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford them, WGRZ reported.

When John Wildeman, the president of the Foundation, heard about Davies' story, he decided that he wanted to help out, so he gifted him the mandolin he wanted.

""$3 is a lot of money to a little kid, most kids,"" Wildeman said. ""For him to sacrifice that and send that money to someone who he thought really needed it, that meant an awful lot to me.""

""I'm like a kid at Christmas when I know we're giving a child an instrument like this,"" Wildeman said. ""It's just a thrill for me to be able to do it.""

Feldman has alleged in the past that Haim was raped at age 11 by a powerful person in Hollywood and the experience led to Haim's drug addiction issues. Feldman’s pal and “Lost Boys” costar died in 2010 at 38 from pneumonia.

Now, Feldman wants to produce a film self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed on Wednesday he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

The news comes on the heels of the now infamous scandal surrounding disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. However, if Feldman is able to prove his allegations are true, it could expose a much deeper criminal conspiracy, he insists.

“I propose to do this by... telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he says.

“I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family.”","Corey Feldman says his life is in danger because he wants expose 'pedophile ring' that abused him, Corey Haim",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/25/corey-feldman-claims-hes-being-targeted-for-death-for-trying-to-expose-hollywood-pedophile-ring.html

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story.

The home, located at 1700 Twin Sisters Road in Fairfield, Calif., was informally known as Solano County’s “Glass House” thanks to its many floor-to-ceiling windows which also overlooked Napa County.

The property listing at Realtor.com also reveals that the home featured 12,662-square-feet of living space, as well as three bedrooms, five baths, and a pool made of reinforced concrete that spanned both the interior and exterior.

THE OBAMAS POTENTIAL NYC BUILDING WAS SITE OF TWO SUICIDES

Much of the home, however, has been reduced to ashes and debris in the wake of the Atlas Fires that have already claimed 5,700 structures, according to SF Gate.

As seen in footage shared by Bay Area reporter Jodi Hernandez, firefighters worked to save the “Glass House” of Solano County before the fires could reach it, but now it barely resembles the structure it once was.

SF Gate further reports that the house itself was first built in 2003 by John Roscoe, a “tobacco packaging entrepreneur” who spent around $17 million to build the house and purchase the surrounding property. He later became involved in a lawsuit with R.J. Reynolds, who accused him of selling “gray market” cigarettes, and was convicted of fraud in 2011.

In her book What Happened, Hillary Clinton wrote this about the notorious and lurid dossier that opposition researchers had assembled on Donald Trump when he was a candidate for president in the 2016 campaign:

""The FBI ... began investigating a dossier prepared by a well-respected former British spy that contained explosive and salacious allegations about compromising information the Russians had on Trump. The Intelligence Community took the dossier seriously enough that it briefed both President Obama and President Elect Trump on its contents before the inauguration.""

This much we already knew from news reports. But in hindsight, how queer that Clinton should have written about and talked up this dossier as though she had been a mere observer of the events that led to its creation and use. Because this week, it has been revealed that Clinton's campaign actually paid to create that very dossier. So had the Democratic National Committee, run by faithful flunky, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

It's no surprise that Clinton or her staff would play dumb about this. The dossier is a radioactive document, with which no one wants to be associated. Not only are much of its contents known to be false, but it also includes obscene allegations about Trump that we won't reprint here.

Clinton's attorney, Marc Elias, and senior campaign officials have been lying through their teeth for a year about their involvement in the dossier. When reporters tried to report the story, these Clinton Democrats pushed back hard, claiming it was an out-and-out lie. Now, their own lies have been laid bare.

The truth about the dossier is a reminder of what was and what was not at stake in last year's presidential contest. Ever since Trump's election, the moral posturing by some of America's sleaziest liars has become nearly unbearable.

In the time since the election, the Left has taken up the banner of ""Resistance."" Each time Trump makes another false, crude, bizarre, or offensive comment, they point back to the choice in November and frame the election as if falsehood conquered truth, darkness overpowered light, and an evil empire overcame good.

In the real world, however, the 2016 campaign was nothing like that. It was a contest between Trump's obvious and extensive disconnection from facts and Clinton's conniving, calculated, and self-serving lies that fit snugly into her 40-year career of corruption and falsehood.","The Trump Dossier, Like So Much Else, Is Due to the Corruption of the Clintons",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/26/trump-dossier-so-much-else-due-corruption-clintons#commenting

FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force located human remains at Cow Meadow Park in Freeport, its New York bureau announced on Wednesday. The FBI acted on a tip connected with the savage street gang MS-13 that led them to the remains, FOX5NY reported.

“FBI has no further comment at this time,” the bureau said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for Nassau County Police Department told Fox News it was assisting the FBI with the investigation. The FBI did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.

MS-13 SPREADING ACROSS US AS AG SESSIONS VOWS TO TAKE DOWN GANG

Residents who frequented the area said they were shocked about the gruesome discovery and said violence rarely occurred in the neighborhood.

“There’s been rumors circulating in the neighborhood that MS-13 was hanging out in the park. But we found it hard to believe,” a resident told FOX5NY.

Investigators also searched a wooded area in Massapequa on Wednesday, but the only discovery announced was the gruesome find in Freeport.

“We’ve been going to this park our whole life,” Adam LaMonica told Newsday. “There’s never any violence down here or anything. It’s very unusual for this part of Freeport.”

The discovery came just a week after 16-year-old Angel Soler’s body was discovered on the Baldwin-Roosevelt border. Soler, who vanished in July, was found dead after a “person of interest” gave Homeland Security Investigations a “detailed” tip about where the remains were.

WHAT IS MS-13, THE VIOLENT GANG TRUMP VOWED TO TARGET?

Sources told Newsday investigators believe MS-13 may have killed Soler. Nassau County police told Fox News they have not confirmed the death was gang-related and there’s an ongoing investigation into the case.

Soler’s mother, Suyapa Soler, also openly said she believed her son’s death was gang-related, but would not reveal what information led her to that conclusion or which gang may have been responsible.

It’s unclear if the remains are linked to Soler’s death at this time. Two of Soler’s good friends and classmates at Freeport High School, Kerin Pineda and Josue David Amaya, also disappeared in May and September 2016. Pineda’s mother, Lilian Olivia, told FOX5NY she ""fears the worst"" for her son and is worried when she hears a body is found that it will be Pineda.

Kennedy are set to be released Thursday.

Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, the government is required to release the final batch of files on the assassination, which happened in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. These secret files have long fueled rumors and speculation that gunman Lee Harvey Oswald wasn’t the only person involved in Kennedy’s murder.

Almost immediately after the Warren Commission in 1964 ruled that Oswald had been the lone gunman, conspiracy theories began to circulate over whether or not he had been the only shooter and if the CIA had been involved in the Kennedy assassination.

But before authorities were able to fully question Oswald, the former U.S. Marine was shot and killed on Nov. 24, 1963, by Texas nightclub owner Jack Ruby – adding more fuel to the speculative fire that the U.S. government was hiding what it knew about the assassination.

The subsequent report by the Warren Commission, which was established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, did little to quell either the rumors that Oswald was killed to cover up a government conspiracy or the doubts that a lonely, alienated gunman could have fired such accurate and rapid shots.

The 1992 act, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush and required the government to release the remaining documents within 25 years’ time, also stipulated that the president is the only person who can stop any of the documents from being released.

President Trump has so far been coy about how many of the 3,100 files – comprising hundreds of thousands of pages – he will make public. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted: ""The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!""

About 30,000 files have previously been released, albeit with heavy redactions, and the National Archives will post the newly released files on its website.

The CIA hasn’t openly said it is counseling Trump to use restraint when deciding what to release and what to withhold, but there is speculation that the intelligence agency wants some materials kept secret -- especially documents generated in the 1990s that are believed to contain the names of people who are still alive.

The chances are slim that the documents will contain any bombshell revelations, especially in regards to questions over whether anyone except Oswald was involved in the killing, but they could reveal some details about the shooter’s mysterious six-day trip to Mexico City right before the assassination.

Oswald said he was visiting the Cuban and Soviet Union embassies there to get visas, but much about his time there remains unknown.

Judge John Tunheim of Minnesota, who led the independent board that reviewed and released thousands of the assassination documents in the 1990s, told The Associated Press that the new papers could detail the arrangements the U.S. entered into with the Mexican government that allowed it to have close surveillance of those and other embassies.

Other files that scholars hope will be released in full include an internal CIA document on its Mexico City station, and a report on Oswald's trip from staffers of the House committee that investigated the assassination.

Scholars also will be looking for any mention – or lack thereof – of Trump’s campaign trail assertion that the father of GOP rival Ted Cruz had been photographed with Oswald before the shooting.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

Earlier this month on Oct. 16, the U.S. military conducted strikes against ISIS in Yemen for the first time which killed 50 militants inside two training camps.

The U.S. military said so far this month, it has killed over 60 ISIS fighters in Yemen as the battle to wipe out the terrorist group spreads from Iraq and Syria.

“In coordination with the government of Yemen, U.S. forces are supporting ongoing counter-terrorism operations in Yemen against ISIS and AQAP to degrade the groups' ability to coordinate external terror attacks and limit their ability to hold territory seized from the legitimate government,” said Maj. Earl Brown, a spokesman for the U.S. military’s Central Command.

As of now, ISIS only controls about 3 percent of Iraq and 5 percent in neighboring Syria, and some of its fighters have left to find safe haven elsewhere.

“We are decimating ISIS in the Middle East,"" President Donald Trump said outside the White House Wednesday. “They'll go to parts of Africa, they'll go to other places, when they get to those places --we'll beat them,” he added.

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

The surgery ""had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,"" Dr. Tripathi said.
But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.","Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Behavior and quality of life also improved.

But surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.

""What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,"" senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

FDA APPROVES INTRAVENOUS VERSION OF TESARO DRUG FOR CHEMOTHERAPY NAUSEA

Not only ""does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,"" she said, it demonstrates that surgery ""should be done as early as possible"" once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.

About 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can't control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.

""This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,"" said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.

""The results are impressive,"" he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. ""The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It's documentation that these techniques really work.""

Although 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.

When all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.

Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child's particular brain abnormality.

Surgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn't affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and ""that may be too soon to see a noticeable change"" in the intelligence quotient.

Post-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.

The weakness ""is significant,"" Dr. Tripathi said. ""The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.""

Other side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.

HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AMONG US ADULTS DECLINING, CDC REPORTS

In contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.

The surgery ""had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,"" Dr. Tripathi said. ""Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.""

But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.

Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.

""Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,"" he said. ""I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.""",First test of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children shows dramatic benefit,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/26/first-test-anti-epilepsy-surgeries-in-children-shows-dramatic-benefit.html

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte presented his third government Thursday, a new coalition that is set to move the Netherlands further to the right.

The new center-right coalition is expected to focus on tax cuts after years of austerity and measures to contain immigration. Rutte jettisoned the socialists from his team in forming the new government.

The coalition is made up of Rutte's liberal VVD, the centrist D66, the Christian Democrats and the faith-based Christian Union party.

The March 15 election gave the coalition a narrow one-seat majority in the 150-seat lower house of the Dutch parliament.

""That's a very small majority. If only two members of the parliament, if they switch, that could mean the end of this government,"" pollster and political commentator Maurice de Hond said.

European Council President Donald Tusk congratulated Rutte and said he was convinced the EU's founding nation ""will continue playing a dynamic and constructive role in the European Union.""

Beyond cutting taxes, Rutte is expected to try to toughen up immigration rules. That's the issue on which Geert Wilders, the anti-Islam lawmaker whose Party for Freedom is the second-largest in parliament, built his base.

The coalition wants to stem the number of migrants seeking to resettle in the Netherlands for economic reasons. It also plans to cut the length of initial residency permits for successful asylum-seekers from five years to three, and do more to compel newcomers to better integrate into Dutch society.

To promote Dutch national identity, all school children will be taught the words and historical context of the national anthem.

Even if there a swing to the right, the new government still cherishes the Dutch brand of permissiveness.

It wants to sanction a small number of cannabis plantations as an experiment aimed at getting a grip on the huge illegal marijuana industry that supplies the famous Dutch cafes that are allowed to sell small amounts of pot.

Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam are duking it out in next month’s gubernatorial race in the Old Dominion commonwealth. Just one of two states electing governors this year, Virginia is a swing state contest viewed as a possible referendum on Trump's first year in office.

Northam leads Gillespie by 7 percentage points in Fox News' latest polling average. Trump lost to opponent Hillary Clinton by about 5 points in Virginia during the 2016 presidential election.

Here’s a look at the candidates.

Ed Gillespie, Republican

This isn’t Ed Gillespie’s first rodeo when it comes to Virginia politics. The 56-year-old ran against incumbent Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in 2014 and nearly defeated him.

Gillespie is a former chair of the National Republican Committee and served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush for nearly two years. Gillespie touts his leadership within conservative circles on his campaign website, highlighting his time as chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia and work as a communications aide to former House Majority Leader Dick Armey.

Gillespie and his wife have three children and live in Fairfax County, Va. He graduated from Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS TO POUR ANOTHER MILLION DOLLARS INTO VIRGINIA STATE ELECTIONS

While Trump endorsed Gillespie in a tweet in October, the establishment gubernatorial candidate hasn’t totally embraced the president or his politics on the campaign trail. And he almost lost to an ardent Trump defender in the primary race.

Still, Trump offered his support and encouraged his more than 40 million Twitter followers to “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Bush is hosted a fundraiser for Gillespie in Virginia earlier this month. And Vice President Mike Pence joined him at a weekend rally.

Ralph Northam, Democrat

Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, is a physician and Army veteran. On his campaign website, he said he is “most proud” of “his career fighting for children – as a pediatric neurologist and volunteer medical director for a pediatric hospice care facility.”

While current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is barred by state law from running for reelection, Northam, 58, is expected to govern the commonwealth much as McAuliffe did. He is for greater gun control and abortion rights. He has also promised to “be a brick wall against the discrimination of the Trump administration,” according to his campaign website.

VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE TOUCHES TAXES, TRUMP, CONFEDERATE STATUES

While encouraging Virginians to vote for Gillespie, Trump accused Northam of “fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs [and] sanctuary cities.”

Northam responded on Twitter with a link to his campaign donations website. He has also called the president a “narcissistic maniac” multiple times during the primary.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Northam in New York earlier this month. And former Vice President Joe Biden backed Northam during a roundtable event.

Former President Barack Obama also campaigned with Northam earlier in October.

Northam lives in Norfolk, Va., with his wife. The pair has two children, a son who is a neurosurgery resident and a daughter who is working as a web developer.

Northam’s campaign was criticized this week for a Democratic mailer that shows Gillespie and Trump along with a photo of the angry white nationalists carrying torches who descended on Charlottesville, Va., in August. The mailer encourages voters to “stand up to hate.”

Northam has stood by the mailer and slammed Gillespie for not denouncing Trump “for not calling these white supremacists out for who they are.”

“Because the message is that we live in a very diverse society. That means that we need to be inclusive,” Northam said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. “We need to welcome people. Our lights need to be on, our doors open. We don’t promote hatred and bigotry in this country and in the commonwealth of Virginia.”

""All these people wanted to come do songs of mine and say thank you because, I had kind of — I hate this, this is awkward for me — I had inspired them to some extent and they wanted to pay me back and I thought it was very nice, so I'm glad we're going to get a chance to do it,"" he said.

In addition to Parton, Rogers will be joined by Little Big Town, the Flaming Lips, Idina Menzel, Elle King, Jamey Johnson and Alison Krauss.

Reflecting on his decades-long career, Rogers said there have been certain standout moments.

Menendez got support on the stand from a Democrat and a Republican. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker testified that Menendez was honest and honorable.

Menendez is on trial in Newark for allegedly accepting gifts from a donor, Dr. Salomon Melgen, including free trips on the eye doctor’s private jet.

MENENDEZ CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY TRIAL: WHAT TO KNOW

""In very difficult circumstances he always keeps his word,"" Graham said during about six minutes of testimony. ""A handshake is all you need from Bob. He's a very honest, hardworking senator.""

Graham arrived at the courthouse before Menendez and spoke briefly with reporters. After his testimony, he told reporters that even though he disagrees with Menendez politically, “all my interactions with Bob have been on the up and up.”

“He is the type of guy who gives you his word and he sticks with it no matter how much pressure put on him to back off,” Graham said, “and we need more of that not less.”

Menendez and Melgen have both pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Booker also testified on Thursday, saying his fellow New Jersey senator is someone who keeps his word.

""There’s a rule I have with my staff, which is under-promise and over-deliver, and that’s what he’s about … when he would tell me something … and I found him profoundly honorable and trustworthy and direct,” Booker said, adding that ""if he gives you his word you can take it to the bank.""

Graham's office said that he traveled to Newark at his own expense.

The trial is in its eighth week. Neither Melgen nor Menendez has testified. The defense is expected to rest its case soon, after which the two sides are expected to spar over how U.S. District Judge William Walls is to instruct the jury on the law.

The definition of official bribery was narrowed by a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that has been responsible for the recent overturning of several politicians' corruption convictions.

The round of 12 gets underway Sunday in the Monster Energy Cup playoffs.

FOX's Matt Napolitano has more:

It's down to a dozen in the quest for the Cup as the top circuit returns to Charlotte for the Bank of America 500 Sunday. Kyle Busch entering this race weekend in quest of his third straight win, but says momentum doesn't mean anything in the playoffs:

Busch trailing the leader Martin Truex Jr. by 18 points in the playoff standings.

This as one of the final 12 speaks out on pay for drivers. Denny Hamlin sounding off during the week that salary should be on the level of athletes in leagues like the NBA and the NFL:

(Denny Hamlin) ""They're risking their life each and every weekend, and they're on the road just, you know, just like everyone else is each and every weekend.""

Hamlin speaking with Sirius XM NASCAR Radio there, calling for more revenue from NASCAR's TV deal to be shared with teams.

This as NASCAR unveiled rule changes for 2018 to cars that will see the addition of radiators and common flat splitters for all races, and efforts to increase down-force and horsepower for competitors.

Both American air carriers and global airlines must comply, affecting all the 2,100 flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day. The directive is far broader than an earlier Trump administration ban on laptops inside the cabins of some airliners, which only targeted 10 Mideast cities and their airlines.

Confusion greeted the new rules. While five global long-haul carriers said they would begin the new security interviews on Thursday, each offered different descriptions of how the procedure would take place, ranging from a form travelers would be required to fill out to being verbally quizzed by an airline employee. Other carriers insisted their operations remained the same.

""The security measures affect all individuals, international passengers and U.S. citizens, traveling to the United States from a last point of departure international location,"" said Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. ""These new measures will impact all flights from airports that serve as last points of departure locations to the United States.""

The new rules come at the end of a 120-day window for new U.S. safety regulations to be implemented following the lifting of the laptop ban imposed on some Mideast airlines.

They include ""heightened screening of personal electronic devices"" and stricter security procedures around planes and in airport terminals, Farbstein said. She did not elaborate.

U.S. carriers will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents 275 airlines, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Vaughn Jennings of the trade group Airlines for America said that while the new rules include ""complex security measures,"" U.S. officials have been flexible.

""The safety and security of passengers and crew is the highest priority for U.S. airlines and we remain committed to ensuring the highest levels of security are in place throughout the industry,"" Jennings said.

However, not all were convinced of the new measures' effectiveness.

""The part of the new measures I don't like is that airline personnel are being put back into the security screening process,"" said Jeffrey Price, an aviation-security expert at Metropolitan State University of Denver. ""Airline ticket agents aren't always the best at conducting security measures.""

This is just the latest decision by President Donald Trump's administration affecting global travel.

In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs inside of them. The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S. Some also increasingly swab passengers' hands to check for explosive residue.

Stephen Paddock wanted to know how Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department SWAT teams force their way into rooms and buildings, but it was unclear if the shooter used any of that information, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.

The revelation came after investigators found a laptop belonging to Paddock in his hotel room that was missing its hard drive, the official added.

In a stunning development, the missing hard drive has not been located – and it could be key in finding out why Paddock killed 58 people in the Oct. 1 attack.

FULL COVERAGE OF MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS

More than three weeks after the shooting, no manifesto or anything else indicating Paddock’s motive has been found, and Las Vegas police officials – who are approaching two weeks since the last time they gave an update to the public about the investigation – are remaining tight-lipped.

In addition to the searches, Paddock had set up cameras inside and outside his hotel room so he could see the hallway, authorities said, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo had said Paddock may have been using them to monitor officers descending upon his room.

He also had left a handwritten note in his room with numbers on it, which investigators believe were calculations of the distance and trajectory of his targets at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, which was taking place across the street from the resort property.

STEPHEN PADDOCK'S BROTHER ARRESTED FOR CHILD PORN

Mandalay Bay, meanwhile, has been hit with lawsuits from victims whose lawyers have been blasting MGM Resorts International for allegedly not keeping close enough tabs on Paddock.

“It's inconceivable to us that the perpetrator was capable of transporting what amounts to an actual armory of weapons into the hotel, especially in an era in which shooting incidents and terrorism are front page news on a daily basis,” attorney Richard Bridgford said in a statement to Fox News earlier this week.","Las Vegas shooting: Internet searches, missing hard drive could be key to motive",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/26/las-vegas-shooting-internet-searches-missing-hard-drive-could-be-key-to-motive.html

“Everything is gone,” Biagini said. “My wheelchair. My prosthetics. Everything. I couldn’t believe it. I seriously had no words.”

Biagini was diagnosed with arthrogryposis, which left her with stiff joints that wouldn’t bend from the waist down. She relies on her prosthetics to run track and ride horses, KTVU reported.

Her mother told the news outlet that Biagini’s prosthetics are a part of her identity. On Friday, staff at Hanger Clinic provided and fitted Biagini with new prosthetics free-of-charge.

“She’s just such a beautiful light in this world to start with, and to be able to put that smile back on her face is priceless,” Pola O’Rourke, of the Hanger Clinic, told KTVU.

Biagini, who prefers prosthetics over a wheelchair, said her confidence has returned.

Perkins was subjected to years of sexual harassment by her boss.","A former assistant to Harvey Weinstein who signed a non-disclosure agreement before accepting a monetary settlement from the movie mogul has decided enough is enough, breaking her silence about his sexual harassment of her.

Zelda Perkins was one of at least eight alleged victims to reach settlements and sign NDAs with Weinstein related to years of sexual harassment and abuse .

Perkins came forward Monday, telling the Financial Times that Weinstein’s sexual misconduct began the very first day she ended up alone with him while working out of Miramax’s London office.

“He went out of the room and came back in his underwear,” she recalled. “He asked me if I would give him a massage. Then he asked if he could massage me.”

She and a colleague split a roughly $330,000 settlement in October 1998 and signed agreements barring them from going public with their allegations.

“I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement,” said Perkins, who now works for the Robert Fox theater production company. “Unless somebody does this there won’t be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.”

Perkins’ NDA included a donation to a woman’s charity and her demands that Weinstein undergo therapy “for as long as his therapist deems necessary.” Miramax said it would comply with that clause for three years.

The company also promised that it would appoint three “complaint handlers” to investigate any subsequent sexual harassment complaints.

If a complaint was filed against Weinstein within two years of Perkins’ contract and it resulted in either a settlement of either roughly $46,000 or six months’ salary, Miramax would report it to Disney, its then-owner, or fire Weinstein.

It’s unclear whether Miramax fully abided by the terms of Perkins’ NDA.

Perkins was subjected to years of sexual harassment by her boss.

Weinstein, she said, would often walk around the room naked and asked her to be in the room while he bathed.

“This was his behavior on every occasion I was alone with him,” Perkins said. “I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.”

Perkins said her breaking point came after her colleague came forward “white as a sheet and shaking” with similar allegations while the crew was in Venice for a film festival from in September 1998.

“She told me something terrible had happened. She was in shock and crying and finding it very hard to talk. I was furious, deeply upset and very shocked. I said: ‘We need to go to the police’ but she was too distressed. Neither of us knew what to do in a foreign environment.”

Perkins said negotiating her NDA was “incredibly distressing” and that she was told it ultimately came down to his word against hers.

“I was very upset because the whole point was that we had to stop him by exposing his behavior,” she said. “I was warned that he and his lawyers would try to destroy my credibility if I went to court. They told me he would try to destroy me and my family.”

Perkins said part of the reason why she publicly came forward now — despite potential legal ramifications — is because NDAs should be “regulated in a fair way.”

“I want to call into question the legitimacy of agreements where the inequality of power is so stark and relies on money rather than morality,” she explained. “I want other women who have been sidelined and who aren’t being allowed to own their own history or their trauma to be able to discuss what they have suffered. I want them to see that the sky won’t fall in.”

She added, “My entire world fell in because I thought the law was there to protect those who abided by it. I discovered that it had nothing to do with right and wrong and everything to do with money and power.”

“A woman needs to always have her wits about her and needs to realize that there are predators out there,” she told Fox News at her annual Women’s Health Summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday. “But people in power who have issues are in a position to be a predator and take advantage of someone that is young or weak or worried about their job or career or whatever…”

Drescher, 60, had some advice for women who may face a situation of sexual abuse.

“I think the most important thing is to not be afraid to say ‘This is unacceptable behavior’ and walk away and then make some noise about it and get a posse of other people in your corner so you don’t have to worry about being ostracized.”

“The Nanny” star was in in her apartment with her now-ex-husband Peter Marc Jacobson in 1995 when two men broke in tied up Jacobson and raped Drescher and a female friend who was at her home having dinner with the couple. The sitcom star first opened up about her experience in 1996.

“We have to always turn lemons into lemonade and pain into purpose,” she said of her trauma. “Knowing that we have to maintain our sense of right and wrong and our dignity and not let anybody compromise how we feel about ourselves… We have to always make sure we hold firm to our sense of worth and not let anybody ever treat us in a way that doesn’t feel respectful.”



On Tuesday, Drescher also spoke out about women’s health. The actress, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer 16 years ago, said she is passionate about educating women about their health.

“There is a lot we can do personally to reduce or risk of getting sick and actually help ourselves get well if we are sick,” she enthused.

Sony will roll out a new robot dog that’s capable of real Fido-like feelings – including bonding with its human masters and responding to owner commands, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The pet bot will be similar to Sony’s AIBO robot pet prototypes, which have been discontinued, and will have updated software to allow users to control their home appliances.

Sony plans to unveil the product at a media event next November and roll it out in spring 2018. It’s unclear how much it will cost.

Last year, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said at a strategy briefing that the company was in the process of developing “a robot capable of forming an emotional bond with customers and able to grow to inspire love and affection.”

Sony sold about 150,000 AIBOs between 1999 and 2006 for between $600 and more than $2,000, the Journal said. The robots came with artificial intelligence allowing them to greet its owner, play with a ball, dance and sing songs.

The new pet robots will have smoother movements and improved motors and sensors. They may also include internet connectivity allowing the pooch to learn new tricks and control appliances.

Andrew Jackson’s leadership proved to be exactly what the fledgling United States needed as it battled enemies coming from all sides in the War of 1812, culminating with his role at the decisive Battle of New Orleans. We get a peek at his leadership style here:

His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months’ duration.

Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson’s style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved. General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers’ rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty.

“Citizens!” he wrote in a broadside. “Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No -- we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world.”

Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, “Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi.” Together, he observed, “[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.”

Why should Swiss bankers answer to the U.S. when they didn't violate Swiss law?","I am in Switzerland this week interacting with and lecturing to students and faculty at the University of Zurich. The subject of our work is the U.S. Constitution and its protections of personal liberty.

In most countries, government has begrudgingly granted snippets of personal liberty to keep those who are demanding it at bay. Throughout history, kings and other tyrants have, from time to time, given in to pressures from folks to recognize their natural rights. These instances of ""power granting liberty,"" as the practice has come to be known, usually have come about to avoid further bloodshed.

In the United States and in Switzerland, however, the opposite took place. In both countries, sovereign states came together to establish a central government peacefully. This model is known as ""liberty granting power."" Indeed, the Swiss Constitution is modeled on our own, whereby free and independent states delegated some of their sovereignty to a new, limited central government.

Today, however, the two countries are embroiled in a below-the-radar dispute over whether U.S. federal courts can try Swiss nationals who have diligently followed Swiss law and who have never been in the U.S.

Here is the back story.

When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he included a section he would later refer to as the indictment of British King George III. It characterized the “long train of abuses and usurpations” designed by the king to “harass our people, and eat out their substance.” This was harsh language, even by today’s standards.

One of those abuses and usurpations was “for transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.” He was referring to the British practice of charging colonists -- who had never been to Great Britain -- in London for behavior that was lawful in the Colonies but somehow allegedly ran afoul of English law.

The typical charge was speaking out and inducing others to oppose the king and Parliament or refusing to pay their unlawful taxes. These so-called crimes were often generally characterized as treason against the Crown.

This British practice of dragging American colonists before British judges and British juries was so offensive to the colonists that the Framers sought to prevent it from happening here by crafting two prophylactic clauses in the Constitution itself. One clause defined treason as only levying war against the United States or giving aid and comfort to our enemies. The other clause required that people be tried in the state where such crimes were alleged to have been committed.

The Constitution recognizes that American people and property can be harmed by foreigners in foreign countries, and the common law at the time required that if there was no harm, there was no crime.

These first principles -- crime is harm and people should be tried in the place where they are accused of committing a crime -- have been bedrocks of Anglo-American jurisprudence for hundreds of years.

The reason for trying a criminal case in the place where the action took place is to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process. The form of due process requires the pre-existence of the statute allegedly violated, notice of the violation, a trial before a neutral judge and jurors, and the right to appeal the trial’s outcome, but the essence of due process is fairness.

Fairness at trial means that the defendant has the constitutionally required tools available to him, not the least of which are witnesses and tangible things to aid in his defense. The Framers knew this would be nearly impossible to achieve in a foreign land before a foreign court.

This understanding subsisted until the Reagan administration, when the government began seizing foreigners abroad and bringing them to the U.S. for trial. Though these seizures were repellent, the crimes -- violence against individuals or large-scale distribution of dangerous drugs -- were crimes everywhere, and the harm caused by them was palpable.

Until now.

Now Swiss bankers who have followed and respected Swiss banking laws -- which honor the privacy of customers, no matter who they are -- and who have never caused harm to American people or property are on trial in the U.S.

The charges? Violating U.S. banking laws by failing to report suspicious transactions to U.S. banking regulators. And for those “pretended offenses,” these bankers have been transported “beyond Seas” for trial.

The Department of Justice is unable to point to any harm caused by these so-called offenses, but federal judges, just as they did in the Reagan era, are accepting the DOJ argument of universal jurisdiction -- that somehow American federal courts can try anyone, no matter where a person is said to have committed a crime, as long as the defendant is physically in the courtroom.

But this violates the Declaration of Independence and Constitution’s first principles, and it subjects American bankers and government officials to the same pretended universal jurisdiction of foreign courts. Indeed, a court in Spain has indicted former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan.

Why should Bush and Rumsfeld answer to Spain for events that allegedly occurred in Afghanistan? Why should Swiss bankers answer to the U.S. when they didn't violate Swiss law?

This is all about power and the fiction of universal jurisdiction -- a fiction the Framers thought they had buried. It needs to be buried again.",Judge Andrew Napolitano: Why are Swiss bankers on trial in the US when they didn’t violate any Swiss law?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/judge-andrew-napolitano-why-are-swiss-bankers-on-trial-in-us-when-didn-t-violate-any-swiss-law.html

Now, Feldman wants to produce a film self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed on Wednesday he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

The news comes on the heels of the now infamous scandal surrounding disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. However, if Feldman is able to prove his allegations are true, it could expose a much deeper criminal conspiracy, he insists.

“I propose to do this by... telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he says.

“I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family.”","Corey Feldman says his life is in danger because he wants expose 'pedophile ring' that abused him, Corey Haim",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/corey-feldman-says-his-life-is-in-danger-because-wants-expose-pedophile-ring-that-abused-him-corey-haim.html
