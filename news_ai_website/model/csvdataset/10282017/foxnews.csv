Speedkore Performance Group is offering a carbon fiber body kit for the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon that should make the quickest car in the world even quicker.

The specialty parts company is bringing a fully built demonstrator to the SEMA auto show in Las Vegas, where “I can’t drive 55” singer Sammy Hagar will do the honors of unveiling it at its public debut.

Full details haven’t yet been released, but Speedkore already offers carbon fiber body panels for the Dodge Challenger Hellcat that reduce the hefty muscle car’s weight by over 600 pounds.

The 4,276-pound Demon is over 200 hundred pounds trimmer than a Hellcat, as it’s delivered with only a driver’s seat and is fitted with several lightweight components that allow it to do a standing quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds. Losing another 600 should take a big chunk out of that, and your wallet.

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

A COSPLAY SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR COMIC CON ATTENDEES

Escape rooms have expanded across the United States from major cities like Los Angeles and New York to Birmingham and Kansas City — but the ""Jigsaw"" version might be a little bit more terrifying than most.

Jenefer Brown, Lionsgate’s SVP of Global Live and Location Based Entertainment, said that bringing a ""Saw""-themed escape room to New York Comic Con seemed logical, considering the theme of the franchise.

“More than 200,000 fans attended New York Comic Con this year,"" Brown told Fox News. ""We know from the success of the franchise that these fans are our core audience. At the same time, escape rooms have been booming. It felt like a recipe for success.”

“We wanted our fans to have a genuine emotional experience tied to Jigsaw,"" added Evan Fisk, the Vice President of Digital Marketing at Lionsgate. ""John Kramer famously gives people the chance to escape the traps he sets. Building an escape room offered a chance to let our fans experience the fun and fear of playing Jigsaw's game, without the danger.”

Fox News also got the chance to try out the ""Jigsaw""-themed attraction, and terror immediately swept over our rugged team of four. My team’s descent into madness began in a claustrophobic virtual reality room, made even smaller with a costumed Jigsaw in the corner. Each player was then attached to an ominous chain by the arm — a throwback to the original Saw movie, where the unlucky victims are chained to a wall and given a saw strong enough to chop of a foot but too weak to cut through the metal links.

Menacing chain? Check. Unsettling Jigsaw in corner? Check. Our abject terror was soon exacerbated by Jigsaw’s sinister voice delivering his instructions, and setting the gruesome scene of the impending escape room.

Once my co-workers and I were briefed on the storyline, we were marched into the escape room. The five-minute timer was set, the door was slammed shut, our adrenaline started pumping, and it was go-time. So did we perish?

Anthony’s parents, George and Cindy Anthony, sat down for an interview with Chris Hansen’s “Crime Watch Daily” recently in which they opened up about their strained relationship with their daughter.

“Oh god. If it came down to that, I would [sue],” Cindy Anthony told Hansen, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

In the interview, Anthony’s parents did not hold back on their thoughts about their daughter, saying they believe she was mentally ill, People reported.

Cindy said she believed Casey might have had a seizure at the time of Caylee’s death echoing Anthony’s attorney, Cheney Mason, who said earlier this year that his client had a “blackout” following the toddler’s death, People reported.

“Stay away. Stay away from me. If she wants a relationship again with her mom, she's got a lot of explaining to do, but I don't want to hear it no more. I don’t want to see her,” he told Hansen.

Cindy’s message to her daughter urged her to be honest and stop blaming others.

Simpson was acquitted in 1995 in the murder of his ex-wife Nichole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson was convicted in 2008 of armed robbery, kidnapping and other charges and was released from Nevada’s Lovelock Correctional Center earlier this month.

I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true. If someone figures out your email password, you’re in trouble. Social media? Even worse. Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.

It seems not a week goes by that we don’t hear about another data breach. How do you know if the hackers have your info? Click here to find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.

Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords. We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&. This theory — that passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember — reigned for years.

It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols. The organization’s manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasn’t nearly as effective as he’d thought.

Thanks to a new round of research, cybersecurity experts have changed their tune. Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like “p@ssword1” or “letmein.” But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.

1. Passwords should withstand 100 guesses

This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldn’t be tied to any public information about you or your family.

Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, such as your birthday and the name of your pet. And a little data goes a long way. Experts believe criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73 percent of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations of the same password.

Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family. Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online. These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches. Click here for five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.

2. Use a phrase

Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a “passphrase.” These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.

Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuchsia. You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your mom knows such trivia about you. You could compose a passphrase like “ilikefuschiaastronauts.” You’ll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.

I told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago, and the advice is still valid. Go here to come up with your own.

3. Go long

You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters long. As if that isn’t weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words. While many people just try to meet the minimum requirement of eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.

You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you. You could list all your pets’ names from childhood, like “fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie,” or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant,

like “academy main washington ohio central.” Easy to remember. Hard to crack.

4. Don’t change your password until you have to

Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months. But as NIST’s Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “Expiration isn’t a motivator to create a brand-new password, it’s motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.”

If you’ve created a strong password, then don’t worry about changing it out all the time. Just stick with it unless you’ve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.

5. Choose something memorable

Remember, all passwords should be unique, but they don’t have to be cumbersome. NIST calls passwords “memorized secrets.” You want to avoid the temptation to write them down, so pick passwords that mean something to you and will stay in your mind.

I’m not a big fan of password managers. I commit my passwords to memory. But if you cannot do that, here’s a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.

6. Get creative with characters

It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions. Go back to Burr’s advice on passphrases. You might choose something like “ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!” or “Igivemyjob1000%everyday.” Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.

7. Use two-factor identification

While passwords help protect your information, cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever. If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until it’s too late.

Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and it’s hard to assess how much information was leaked and how it will be used. (If you haven’t checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cybercrooks, click here and do it now.)

That’s why two-factor identification is so important. Using text messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, or when it’s entered on a new device or at a new location. You will have to verify that it’s you trying to gain access.

The HGTV personality worked with his twin Drew Scott on the book, which hit shelves Sept. 5, but for Jonathan some of the revelations in the tell-all took on a more personal tone.

Jonathan Scott, who has been tight-lipped about his romantic past, opened up about his divorce from an airline-crew scheduler named Kelsey. The two wed in 2007, and though they had been together for more than six years when they got married, the pair called it quits two years later.

“I think when you are young and you don’t really know what you want in life, you can commit to something and think at the time it is right,” he told Fox News.

He said his failed union gave him a new outlook.

“It really gives you perspective,” he said of marriage. “Anyone who has been through failed relationships — even people in successful relationships — understand that you gain perspective about what is important to you.”

Though Scott, 39, has not spoken much about his divorce, he felt it was an important piece of the brothers’ memoir.

“I never talked about my divorce before and anyone who has been through divorce before knows how painful that is,” he revealed. “When I commit to something I commit 100 percent and knowing I failed and we just weren't meant to be together was difficult.”

He wanted to share his tough experience with fans.

“We said if we were going to do a memoir we were only going to do it if it was authentic and it was honest and we did not cut anything out, and we committed to that,” he told us. “The book shows the highs and the lows.”

Because of YOU, #ItTakesTwoBook is on The @NYTimes' Monthly Business Best Sellers List! Thank you so much. A post shared by Jonathan Scott (@mrsilverscott) on Oct 7, 2017 at 8:59am PDT

And Scott isn't dwelling on his divorce. He gushed to us about girlfriend Jacinta Kuznetsov.

“Jacinta and I are madly in love with each other. We are perfect for each other and stand each other’s strengths and weaknesses. I’ve always said I don't regret anything as long as I have learned from it. I think the past relationships I’ve had were very important learning scenarios in my life.”

He said even though he’s been through a divorce, he’s still a strong believer in marriage.

“There is no situation in the world where I would shun marriage just because I had one that didn't work,” he said. “You can have two good people who are just not good for each other and I’ve never been the type of person to wallow in misery.”

Aside from his relationship and recently released book, Scott has been busy working on the new HGTV spinoff “Property Brothers At Home: Drew’s Honeymoon House.” The show, which premieres Nov. 22, chronicles the brothers’ journey to transform a home for Drew and fiancée Linda Phan.

“It’s absolutely phenomenal; this is hands down one of my favorite designs of all time,” he said. “It makes a difference too when it’s for your brother and future sister-in-law; it’s their very first home together. It means a lot and that’s why I wanted to make sure we get it right.”

Alexandra Leigh Carter, of Toowoomba, Queensland, says she purchased the makeup kit at the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths — and even tested it out on her son’s wrist for 20 minutes — before applying the product to his face during a “trial run” ahead of Halloween.

“This was only on him for 3 minutes and then had to immediately take him for a shower,” she wrote alongside photos of her little boy with redness and irritation on his face. “It has severely burnt his skin.”

Carter says she shared the post to warn other parents to thoroughly test the makeup products their kids plan to use on Halloween. But she also called for the product to be discontinued, and called it “rubbish.”

“I've had his face painted countless time [sic], though whatever is in your product is horrific,” she wrote.

In the comments, Carter further explained that the ordeal “absolutely scared the hell out of both of us,” leading her son to ask if his would be scarred forever. Thankfully, she confirmed the redness died down, and that there doesn't appear to be any lasting marks on his face.

INFAMOUS 'THONG JEANS' ARE NOW A HALLOWEEN COSTUME

“Not even the most conscious of mums can avoid something like this from happening when you purchase products intended for children,” she said, adding that she didn’t make an “informed choice” when purchasing the cheap product. “I made a mistake unfortunately and THANKFULLY never put it on my youngest son as he does have adverse reactions.”

Carter claims she was offered a $25 gift card as compensation for the incident. She also wrote that Woolworths has been “nothing but helpful and apologetic,” though she is still waiting to hear the results of their investigation into the makeup product.

In the meantime, she says, she’ll be comparing the product’s ingredients to others on the market.

Halperin, who until recently worked for NBC and MSNBC as an analyst, has been accused by several women of alleged sexual assault. Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a woman’s breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.

Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as “an open secret.”

Halperin later apologized for his behavior and claimed that it ended after he resigned from the company. But one woman who interacted with him while she was in college told The Daily Beast a different story.

Katharine Glenn, who was then a junior at Tulane University, reportedly met Halperin while he was a guest speaker at the school in February 2011.

Glenn told The Daily Beast that she and Halperin were seated next to each other at the table and he “got very friendly and put his hand on my upper thigh.”

“[He] was talking to me about helping me with my career, and that I shouldn’t go to law school and should come to D.C. and be a journalist or work on the Hill,” Glenn said. “He offered that I should come back to his hotel room [that night] so we could talk more about my career — and at no point did I think that is what he meant, and the touching under the table did not suggest that, either.”

Glenn described his alleged behavior as “lecherous and gross,” especially considering his age, The Daily Beast reported. While she said she was not at the time afraid of Halperin, she wanted to tell her story to make sure he “never gets near [female] college students ever again.”

According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests.
Since taking office, Trump also has moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign.
In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.","President Trump said Friday that he’ll release “ALL” of the remaining John F. Kennedy files, after being forced by U.S. spy agencies – of which he has been leery – to withhold thousands of still potentially sensitive documents.

""After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,"" Trump tweeted. ""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.""

The National Archives on Thursday released 2,800 once-classified records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Behind the scenes of the much-anticipated release, Trump and his White House lawyers were purportedly until the last minute going back and forth with U.S. intelligence officials over their requests for additional redactions.

And the requests irritated Trump, who continued to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Kelly, his chief of staff; White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg.

Just before the documents’ release, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had ""no choice"" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security.

Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.

According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests.

But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.

On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part.

Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be ""extremely circumspect"" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.

The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies.

Between the time Trump was elected in November 2016 and took office in January, he slammed the CIA for concluding Russia hacked Democratic Party emails to help him win the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

And Trump has been critical of how the FBI handled the investigation into then-Secretary of Clinton’s private email servers -- to the point of firing Director James Comey.

Since taking office, Trump also has moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.

Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

“I am profoundly sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused by my past actions,” Halperin wrote. “I apologize sincerely to the women I mistreated.”

Halperin continued that he was aware he was “part of the problem” at ABC News and recognized that he “had a problem.”

“No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me. But I didn’t need a call from HR (human resources) to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop,” Halperin wrote.

Halperin said he went to counseling to work on his issues and he did not engage in the same behavior while he was employed at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime.

MARK HALPERIN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY TWO MORE WOMEN

Halperin’s apology was released near the time CNN, which first published a report Wednesday detailing the sexual harassment allegations, came out with another article of four more women coming forward with new accusations, The Washington Post reported.

CNN reported one woman claimed Halperin masturbated in front of her while another woman said the “Game Change” co-author threw her against a restaurant window and threatened to derail her career after she rebuffed him.

Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a woman’s breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.

Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as “an open secret.”

Following the allegations, Penguin Press canceled a planned book by Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2016 election and HBO called off a miniseries that would have been based on the book. Halperin and Heilemann had collaborated on two previous books, including ""Game Change,"" a best-seller about the 2008 race that almost single-handedly revived the campaign book genre and was the basis for an award-winning HBO adaptation.

President Donald Trump, the one man able to block the release, did not appreciate their persistence. He did not intend to make this easy.

Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, Thursday's release of 2,800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth. It came together only at the last minute, with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated Trump continuing to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.

The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies. He again flashed his skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference. Intelligence officials, meanwhile, were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.

And those officials had their own story tell, some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on Trump's expectations for the documents. The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process. The person, who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the goal was to have all the agency's documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.

Since taking office, Trump has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders, moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.

Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day, Trump was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions. The president earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents, heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades. Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.

Just before the release Thursday, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had ""no choice"" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security. Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.

""The president and White House have been very clear with all agencies for weeks: They must be transparent and disclose all information possible,"" White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Friday.

Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg. Trump made it clear he was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.

Trump's tweets, an official said, were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously his threats to release the documents in their entirety.

According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests. But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.

On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part. Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be ""extremely circumspect"" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.

""After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,"" Trump wrote in a Friday tweet. ""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.""

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

Born in August nearly 15 weeks early, Evans spent every possible moment at their side.

Late in the evening, Evans said goodbye to the girls and began the drive home to her husband, Jacob, and their four young sons. Less than a mile from home, Evans was involved in a crash too horrific for description. Although the investigation is still underway, the other driver was allegedly intoxicated.

It is believed Evans died instantly.

Interviewed by phone, Evans’s husband, Jacob, described the longest and most agonizing night of his life. When his wife hadn’t returned home in a reasonable amount of time, he became worried. After calls to friends and the hospital, he drove the route she would’ve taken home and in a matter of minutes was face to face with a police barricade.

The next few hours marched by like exhausted soldiers. Friends and members of his church family filled his home until finally, at 5:30 a.m., the coroner knocked on his door with one hand and held Katie’s driver’s license with the other.

“The first thing I thought was how do I tell my boys,” Evans said. Later that morning, when the moment was right, Evans gathered the three older boys for a family meeting. Evans led a discussion about God’s plan for his children. “Then I told them that God had asked them to exercise faith in (his) plan. I said their mother had been killed. The boys cried their little hearts out and I was so glad to have so many friends there to hug and hold them.”

As Evans considers his wife’s legacy, he knows it’s rooted in forgiveness. He has no doubt Katie would want friends and family to forgive the other driver. Evans says life is too short for anything other than letting go and moving on.

In fact, when he heard that since Katie’s passing some within his company were expressing anger and frustration, Evans wrote an open letter to the employees. It read:

“Obviously this is a difficult time for me and my family. It has been more difficult as I have heard that some are angry with the driver who killed my wife. Katie would not have wanted that. She was the embodiment of compassion. The hateful activities reported in the news recently troubled her greatly. She felt there was already too much anger in the world. I want you to know that I forgive the driver of that accident. Of course I am sorry that it happened. Of course I wish I could go back in time and change it, but we are all best served by moving forward with today’s reality and the best way to move forward is to honor Katie’s memory and focus on how to take care of her six children. Trials and tribulation are mandatory. Misery is optional. Happiness is a choice, sometimes a difficult choice. I confess I feel little in the way of happiness at the moment, but I am determined to be as happy as I can be and for now that is found in my profound gratitude to a generous and supportive community for the love they have wrapped around me and my family during this challenging time.”

As our interview ended, I asked Jacob Evans what final message he had for my readers. “Katie wasn’t perfect. No one is. But if you want to honor Katie, do what she did every day of her life. Go find a way to make the world a little better.”

And what better way to start than exercising a little forgiveness.","Katie Evans, loving mom killed in car crash following visit of premature twins leaves behind beautiful legacy",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/katie-evans-loving-mom-killed-in-car-crash-following-visit-premature-twins-leaves-behind-beautiful-legacy.html

Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first.","For any liberal to entertain winning the Democratic nomination for president these days, there are some important boxes to be checked, including taking on America’s system of law and order. Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has begun checking the boxes.

Zuckerberg has hired Hillary Clinton’s pollster. He’s hired Barack Obama’s campaign manager. He’s even visited the first presidential caucus state of Iowa. And he’s pandering to the left’s machine by funding a campaign that aims to get rid of our nation’s bail system.

In the dangerous push to end our current bail system, liberals like Zuckerberg are arguing that people across America are being wrongly held in jail because they can’t afford to post bail. This is ridiculous. Our bail system is in place to keep law-abiding Americans safe and to ensure that a person accused of a crime actually appears in court so justice is served.

States that have attempted to pass bail reform policies are seeing the failures of unsecured release up close. Harris County in Texas is fighting a federal lawsuit claiming its bail schedule is unconstitutional and that it keeps poor people in jail.

Chief U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal issued a federal order requiring Harris County to make immediate changes to its pretrial release system. The order requires the sheriff’s office to release anyone charged with a misdemeanor offense on unsecured release within 24 hours.

According to Harris County data since the order took effect, 32 percent of defendants released on unsecured bond have failed to appear for court, compared to only 4 percent released on a surety bond. Failures to appear cause havoc and long delays in the criminal justice system. Justice cannot be served if the accused does not appear for court.

Examples of such releases are occurring in other jurisdictions around the country. A New Jersey theater employee was arrested after law enforcement officers found a bullet-proof vest, grenade, guns and ammunition in his vehicle, causing the theater to be evacuated. He was determined not to be a danger to the community and released on unsecured bond under the new law.

New Jersey’s liberal bail reforms caused one state legislator to send a letter to the speaker of the state Assembly in California regarding a similar bill circulating in his state. The letter states that “dangerous and career criminals are released daily within hours of arrest” with no accountability. He urged the California Legislature not to make the same mistake.

While everyone is innocent until proven guilty, judges are right to set bail for individuals who are charged with a crime. Too many are simply being sent back into the poorest neighborhoods, which proponents of bail reform like Zuckerberg don’t live in.

These released individuals, many of whom are repeat offenders, walk out of jail and continue to victimize the very people proponents of bail reform claim to protect – the poor and indigent.

Unsecured release methods and the use of flawed risk assessment tools are coming under fire every day. The Arnold Foundation, which developed a risk assessment tool being used by several jurisdictions such as New Jersey, is a defendant in a federal lawsuit seeking damages in a wrongful death case.

A career criminal, who had been arrested on felony gun charges days earlier, was released on unsecured means using the Arnold Foundation’s risk assessment tool and then allegedly committed murder.

Elitists like Zuckerberg try to make the argument that the bail system is unfair to poor people, but fail to understand that law-abiding citizens regardless of income level expect laws to be enforced that will keep them safe.

There is nothing safe about the bail reforms currently being implemented and under consideration. Liberals roll out examples of people being held for minor and non-violent crimes who are forced to be away from their families because they couldn’t afford monetary bail. Some such examples do exist.

However, for every one of those stories, there are also stories regarding serious and violent offenders who walk out of jail with no accountability. Headlines such as “Eastside restaurant manager, employees accused of raping woman” and “Jackson zoning board member grabbed gun before child porn arrest, cops say” are all too common.

What is Zuckerberg’s answer to these headlines? Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first. However, in the real world where the rest of us live, there are plenty of concerns for tens of millions of Americans who wish to raise their families in a safe society.

Americans expect that when people are accused of stealing, selling illegal drugs, abusing others, driving drunk and otherwise breaking the law, they will appear in court. If convicted, such individuals will be punished for their crimes so that justice will be served.

As the bail bond reform debate continues and Mark Zuckerberg continues his multimillion-dollar quest to boost his standing with the far left’s power structure, I hope most Americans can understand that when it comes to thinking about reforming our bail system, it’s better to be safe than sorry.",Mark Zuckerberg and liberals seek to weaken bail system that keeps us safe,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/mark-zuckerberg-and-liberals-seek-to-weaken-bail-system-that-keeps-us-safe.html

I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s true. If someone figures out your email password, you’re in trouble. Social media? Even worse. Once hackers access your online bank account, they can wreck your finances, and you may feel the repercussions of that break-in for years.

It seems not a week goes by that we don’t hear about another data breach. How do you know if the hackers have your info? Click here to find out whether your email has been hacked or stolen.

Most of us have the wrong idea about passwords. We think they have to be convoluted messes, like F$%Th5l2K!&. This theory — that passwords should be nonsensical and hard to remember — reigned for years.

It started in 2003 with guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which insisted on random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols. The organization’s manager, Bill Burr, spread this gospel for years. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he admitted that this wasn’t nearly as effective as he’d thought.

Thanks to a new round of research, cybersecurity experts have changed their tune. Yes, you should still avoid guessable passwords like “p@ssword1” or “letmein.” But a strong password also can be logical, fluid and easy to remember.

1. Passwords should withstand 100 guesses

This is the most important part: No matter what your password is, it should withstand 100 guesses, which means it shouldn’t be tied to any public information about you or your family.

Hackers often turn to your social media profiles to find information about you, such as your birthday and the name of your pet. And a little data goes a long way. Experts believe criminals can guess the average person's password nearly 73 percent of the time, and they can often access other accounts by using slight variations of the same password.

Facebook is all about making it easy to share your life with your friends and family. Unfortunately, there are some things you shouldn't share online. These bits of information can put you in danger of identity theft, losing your job or causing other major headaches. Click here for five of the biggest offenders you should not put on your profile.

2. Use a phrase

Instead of thinking of your password as a secret code, think of it as a “passphrase.” These are strings of words that are both easy to memorize but hard for anyone else to crack.

Suppose you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, and your favorite color is fuchsia. You have never mentioned these facts online, and only your mom knows such trivia about you. You could compose a passphrase like “ilikefuschiaastronauts.” You’ll never forget it, and the passphrase will confound hackers for (literally) centuries.

I told how to create a great passphrase a little over a year ago, and the advice is still valid. Go here to come up with your own.

3. Go long

You might want to sit down for this one: The new NIST guidelines suggest allowing users to create passwords up to 64 characters long. As if that isn’t weird enough, the guidelines also allow spaces between words. While many people just try to meet the minimum requirement of eight characters, you will get a much stronger password by stretching things out.

You could theoretically create a complex list or sentence, which still makes perfect sense to you. You could list all your pets’ names from childhood, like “fluffy princess rex spike booboo chewie,” or all the streets on the way to your favorite restaurant,

like “academy main washington ohio central.” Easy to remember. Hard to crack.

4. Don’t change your password until you have to

Until recently, consumers were advised to change their passwords every three months. But as NIST’s Paul Grassi recently told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “Expiration isn’t a motivator to create a brand-new password, it’s motivation to shift one character so you can remember the password.”

If you’ve created a strong password, then don’t worry about changing it out all the time. Just stick with it unless you’ve been notified of a security breach that requires a password reset.

5. Choose something memorable

Remember, all passwords should be unique, but they don’t have to be cumbersome. NIST calls passwords “memorized secrets.” You want to avoid the temptation to write them down, so pick passwords that mean something to you and will stay in your mind.

I’m not a big fan of password managers. I commit my passwords to memory. But if you cannot do that, here’s a free program that will help you store your passwords safely and easily.

6. Get creative with characters

It may take websites some time to catch up to the latest NIST guidelines, but you can still create a memorable password that meets current restrictions. Go back to Burr’s advice on passphrases. You might choose something like “ArizonaCardinalsfootballisnumber1!” or “Igivemyjob1000%everyday.” Those meet the requirements of having at least eight characters, a special character, and upper and lowercase letters.

7. Use two-factor identification

While passwords help protect your information, cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever. If they break into your accounts, you may not recognize the damage until it’s too late.

Months passed before the public learned about the Equifax breach, and it’s hard to assess how much information was leaked and how it will be used. (If you haven’t checked to see if your personal details are in the hands of cybercrooks, click here and do it now.)

That’s why two-factor identification is so important. Using text messages, emails or special apps, an account-holder will receive a notification every time a password is changed, or when it’s entered on a new device or at a new location. You will have to verify that it’s you trying to gain access.

But a cold dose of reality is not far off, as the federal government of Spain decides how harshly to deal with its rebellious citizens.

Catalonians hopped happily in the streets of their region’s capital, Barcelona, waving the banner of independence and swigging cava, the delightful local version of champagne. For them, independence is a sweet-sounding dream. They’ve been part of Spain since the 15th Century, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella married and united their lands. But Catalonia has its own language, history and traditions, and its relationship with the federal government in Madrid has always been uneasy.

For the rest of Spain, the declaration of independence is an insult to national honor. It is the equivalent of California unilaterally declaring that it is a separate country now, because its citizens don’t like President Trump. The Spanish senate declared the breakaway illegal and Catalonia’s pro-independence government illegitimate.

How tough a stand Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy decides to take against Catalonia will probably determine if what is now a dicey political situation becomes physically violent. When Catalonians tried to hold a referendum on the question of independence earlier this month, Rajoy sent the national police to disrupt the election, which he called illegal. Police smashed their way into polling stations, confiscated ballots and roughed up hundreds of would-be voters.

That infuriated Catalonians, many of whom now say they’re ready to defend their homeland with defiance, if necessary. The specter of armed police streaming into Catalonia to put down what has so far been a peaceful protest should make all Spaniards, and Europeans for that matter, act with extreme caution.

It’s unlikely that any European countries will recognize Catalonia as a sovereign state. To do so would open the door to a further dismantling of what is – in name, anyway – the European Union. Already, Britain has voted to leave. It could be just a matter of time until Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly against Brexit, decides it no longer wants to be part of the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic just elected a prime minister who dislikes centralized control from Brussels. And in Italy, the populist Northern League has set itself firmly in opposition to European control over them.

For all the dancing in the streets that Catalonians are doing now, tough days of reckoning are coming. The European Union is, in one respect, like the Mafia: once you join, you can’t leave. Or, if you try to, you’re going to pay a heavy price.","Spain on the brink: The EU has a brutal streak.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

The deaths – a rate of 100 per month – were among more than 3,200 suspected opioid overdoses reported in the state over the same time four-month time period, the Arizona Republic reported Friday.

The shocking numbers were the latest statistical evidence drawing attention to a drug crisis that has plagued the nation – and prompted President Donald Trump on Thursday to declare a “public health emergency.”

The latest data from Arizona were posted Oct. 17 by Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS).

The Arizona Republic’s report came one day after Arizona billionaire John Kapoor, 74, was arrested in connection with an opioid-related bribery scheme. Kapoor’s predecessor as CEO of Insys Therepeutics of Chandler, Ariz. – and five other former executives and managers of the company – have been indicted on similar charges.

Illustrating the extent of the opioid problem, a Rhode Island doctor pleaded guilty Wednesday to participating in the Insys scheme, Reuters reported, and a Kansas physician – whose office was raided by the FBI in July -- faces two lawsuits from patients who claim he pushed an Insys product on them as part of the scheme, the Kansas City Star reported.

In her post, Christ writes that only a quarter of the medical professionals prescribing opioids in Arizona had been checking the AZDHS database on overdoses before writing a prescription. But as of Oct. 16, state law now requires clinicians to check the database before prescribing opioids or benzodiazepines, the Republic reported.

Christ noted that other states have implemented similar mandates, resulting in fewer opioid prescriptions, the newspaper reported.

According to Christ, the data gathered by AZDHS has revealed he following insights into Arizona’s opioid problem:

- Men in their mid- to late 20s are at the highest risk of opioid overdoses.

- Most overdoses occur at home.

- Nearly 40 percent of people suspected of experiencing an overdose were prescribed an opioid less than eight weeks earlier.

- Chronic pain is the symptom cited most frequently by those who experience a suspected overdose.

""ADHS will continue to monitor these indicators on a monthly basis to assess progress,"" Christ said.","Arizona seeing 100 opioid deaths per month, data show",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/28/arizona-seeing-100-opioid-deaths-per-month-data-show.html

In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 so-called “sleeper cell” Russian spies who had reportedly become too close to Hillary Clinton.
Meanwhile, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also overseeing a laundry list of U.S.-Russian initiatives and dealings.
All the while, people linked with Uranium One – and its previous incarnation UrAsia – reportedly paid the Clinton Foundation $145 million in donations.
The great irony of all this though, is that the Clintons started the so-called Russian collusion scandal, and in the end, they may be the ones destroyed by it.","The Left has been desperately working for months to find any shred of evidence that Donald Trump had even the slightest connection to Russia during the presidential campaign. Despite having the full support of their friends in the media, they have consistently failed to find anything substantive.

At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president. Now, I have another theory: The Trump-Russia story is meant to serve as a pure distraction aimed at masking real corruption by the Clinton political machine.

As The Hill reported on Sunday, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, a Kremlin-linked bank paid her husband, former President Bill Clinton, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also during her tenure as top diplomat, earlier reports indicate Canadian and Russian business executives directed many millions more to the Clinton Foundation. In fact, citing recently unsealed Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, The Hill described a thorough Russian campaign aimed at gaining access to the Clintons and capitalizing on their influence, while also spying on them to advance a pro-Russia agenda. In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 so-called “sleeper cell” Russian spies who had reportedly become too close to Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also overseeing a laundry list of U.S.-Russian initiatives and dealings.

Among other things, she served on the Committee on Foreign Investment, where she voted in favor of President Obama’s approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian business, to a state-owned Russian nuclear energy outfit. At the time, the Canadian company controlled 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves.

Before the sale was approved, a Kremlin-linked bank that supported the deal paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a 90-minute speech in Moscow to promote the Uranium One’s stock. Bill then met personally with Vladimir Putin. All the while, people linked with Uranium One – and its previous incarnation UrAsia – reportedly paid the Clinton Foundation $145 million in donations.

You can’t make this stuff up, and while the news media continues to acknowledge the facts, they still claim there is no foul play on behalf of the Clintons in terms of the uranium deal. The Media Research Center found that the ABC, NBC, and CBS evening shows have “spent only 3 minutes and 1 second on the Clinton Foundation scandal in more than two years.”

In comparison, another Media Research Center report found that since Inauguration Day evening shows on these three networks have aired “1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.”

And remember: The so-called collusion story came out of supposed opposition research we now know was funded by Clinton and her Democrat allies.

Thankfully, House and Senate Republicans have now launched new investigations into the Clintons’ ties to Russia – as well as Hillary’s illegal use of a private email server as Secretary of State. The email scandal is now even more significant given that we know that she continued to use a private, insecure email server despite the FBI arresting a ring of Russian agents who were specifically targeting her.

As I told Sean Hannity on Monday, I think we are on the edge of the greatest corruption scandal in American history.

The first thing Congress should do is demand that every single dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation and its charity initiatives be made public to show exactly where the Clintons derived their money. I suspect there are millions of foreign dollars hidden away in foreign subsidiaries that were never reported in financial disclosures.

The truth about the level of foreign donation, influence peddling, and outright corruption involved in the Clinton world could change American politics forever.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

A number of folks observed that the brown kernel was the only one actually doing something – putting in a hard day’s work while other corn kernels goofed off.

I contend it’s just a cartoon on a cereal box, so why is this even a “thing”? But my opinion seems to be in the minority (no pun intended).

Kellogg's dutifully responded on Twitter - reaffirming its commitment to diversity and inclusion. In other words, they respect corn kernels of all colors and socio-economic backgrounds.

""Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion. We did not intend to offend - we apologize. The artwork is updated & will be in stores soon,"" the company stated.

Though Sanders had never hiked for more than two weeks before setting out for the A.T., it was not his first serious outdoor escapade.

In his youth, Sanders broke the record for underwater-breath-holding in 1959, and was IUSA spearfishing athlete of the year in 1965, the Washington Post notes. A Navy veteran and lifelong parks and recreation professional, at age 80, he paddled the entire Mississippi River in support of juvenile diabetes research.

Repeatedly citing how critical the support of fellow hikers, or “trail angels,” was to his achieving his dream, Sanders reports that it was all worth it.

“The best comment from one of them was, ‘I want to be like you when I’m your age.’ That kept me going,” he said.","82-year-old finishes Appalachian Trail, becomes oldest to ever complete hike",http://www.foxnews.com/great-outdoors/2017/10/27/82-year-old-finishes-appalachian-trail-becomes-oldest-to-ever-complete-hike.html

X-ray technology was used to reveal the ghostly unfinished portrait of the Scottish Queen, who reigned from 1542 to 1567. Convicted of treason against Queen Elizabeth I of England, she was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle in England in 1587.

Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. The 1589 painting of Maitland, who was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, has been attributed to the Dutch artist Adrian Vanson.

LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND

Mary’s hidden portrait was discovered by Dr. Caroline Rae, a research fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Working with National Galleries of Scotland, Rae examined the painting using x-ray technology, which penetrates layers of paint but does not penetrate pigments containing heavy metals such as lead white, a white pigment that was used in paintings of that time.

The x-ray reveals the shadowy outline of a woman, who experts believe is Mary, Queen of Scots, based on other depictions of the controversial queen.

After abdicating the Scottish throne amid suspicions that she was implicated in her husband’s murder, Mary was imprisoned from 1568 until her death by her cousin Elizabeth I, who perceived her as a threat.

RARE ROMAN COIN DISCOVERED ON REMOTE SCOTTISH ISLAND

In a statement, Rae described the discovery of the hidden portrait as an “exciting revelation.”

Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland usually hangs in Ham House, near London, but is part of a new display that opens Oct. 28 at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.

The fact that Mary’s portrait was painted over with a portrait of Sir John Maitland just two years after her execution may reflect someone’s desire to distance themselves from the Scottish queen.

TEENAGER'S DISCOVERY OF ROMAN TREASURE TROVE DELIGHTS EXPERTS

“Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it,” said David Taylor, curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust, which owns Ham House. “It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing.”

The portrait discovery is just the latest fascinating find to shed new light on Scotland’s rich history. Earlier this year, for example, experts announced the discovery of a rare Roman coin on a remote island in the Orkney archipelago. Archaeologists and volunteers also found the location of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.

In 2014, a stunning hoard of ancient silver, believed to have been used as bribes by Romans, was discovered with a metal detector by a teenager in Dairsie, in the Scottish region of Fife.

But while speaking to reporters at the 64th annual Governor’s Conference on Economic and Community Development, Corker said it was “way, way too early"" to decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination, USA Today reported.

“So the only thing that I’m thinking about right now over the next 14 months truly is doing the best job I can as a senator,” Corker said. “You know, I don’t know what I’m doing next Sunday.”

The notion that Trump will be impeached is unrealistic, Corker said, even as some media reports speculated he was building a case for the president's removal from office.

Corker added that he was wary of contemplating a presidential run because of how it would affect his current responsibilities.

""I think that if you even begin thinking those things, everything you do becomes viewed through a different lens,"" he said.

Corker, who has announced that he will not seek a third Senate term in 2018, has long feuded with the president. After the deadly violence at protests in Charlottesville, Va., in August, Corker said that Trump had demonstrated neither the “stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.""

On Oct. 8, after Trump tweeted that Corker was a “negative voice” who lacked “the guts to run” for reelection without the president’s endorsement, Corker likened the White House to an “adult day care center.”

Later that day, Corker told the New York Times that Trump was setting the U.S. “on the path to World War III.” The president hit back, calling the senator a “lightweight” who ""couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.""

Corker again excoriated the president Tuesday, tweeting that he was “utterly untruthful” and vowing he would not support Trump in any future campaign.

But Corker acknowledged his attacks on Trump might not be endearing him to many of his constituents. In a survey conducted this month, Corker’s disapproval rating had soared to 41 percent in Tennessee, marking a 14-point increase since last spring. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating in the state has held steady at approximately 50 percent.

""We were surprised that it hadn't dropped further than it did,"" Corker said of his approval rating.

Thailand's new king led a royal merit-making ceremony for his late father's relics on Saturday, the fourth day of an elaborate five-day funeral that caps a year of mourning.

Buddhist monks from Thailand and abroad chanted prayers as King Maha Vajiralongkorn lit candles during the ceremony at the throne hall at Bangkok's Grand Palace.

On Thursday, a ceremonial urn representing King Bhumibol Adulyadej's remains was transferred from the throne hall to an ornate crematorium in somber processions involving thousands of troops, a golden palanquin, a gilded chariot and a royal gun carriage.

Just before midnight Thursday, smoke rose from the crematorium, which was built across from the palace in the year since Bhumibol died at age 88, signaling his cremation had taken place following a day of spectacular funeral processions broadcast worldwide.

On Sunday, the final day of the funeral, Bhumibol's cremated remains are set to be enshrined in spiritually significant locations.

Bhumibol's death on Oct. 13, 2016, after a reign of seven decades, sparked a national outpouring of grief for a monarch who was regarded by many Thais as a father figure. Yet it also ushered in a sense of uncertainty for Thais who had grown used to Bhumibol serving as a unifying presence in a country regularly beset by political upheaval.",Thai king leads ceremony for his late father's relics,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/28/thai-king-leads-ceremony-for-his-late-fathers-relics.html

Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real.
It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem.
Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power.
The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.","Yet another anti-male group has emerged, this time in Washington D.C. It’s called Rethink Masculinity, and it is billed as a community where “people identifying as men” learn how social constructs of masculinity are harmful and then subsequently work to construct “healthier” ways to be men. The program joins a host of other like-minded initiatives, most of which are on college campuses—such as the Men’s Project at the University of Wisconsin, Masculinity 101 at Brown, and the Duke Men’s Project.

The goal of these programs is always the same: “to help men examine their own biases and behaviors in order to cut down on misogyny and gender-based violence,” writes Olivia Campbell at New York magazine.

Adds Campbell, “There’s no doubt the problems these classes aim to tackle are pervasive ones — a reality that’s been made especially, painfully clear in recent days and weeks, as the Harvey Weinstein revelations have pushed discussions of sexual assault and harassment to the forefront. But can a class really be enough to chip away at something so deeply entrenched?”

Probably not, notes Eric Mankowski, associate chair of the psychology department at Portland State University. “A single class is unlikely to undo years of socialization in toxic masculinity.”

Years of socialization in toxic masculinity. Right, because the recent events regarding men behaving badly, whether in the media, in Hollywood, or even on college campuses, couldn’t possibly be anything but that.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem. It means power is.

It couldn’t possibly be that the stories about which we’re far too privy represent the basest of the base—individual human beings who lack basic decency and character and who do not represent an entire sex. It couldn’t be that we know too much for our own good and at the same time know nothing specific about the events themselves. It couldn’t be that women on campus or in Hollywood or in the media are culpable in any way—because we all know women are always innocent and men, well, are not. It couldn’t be that those bastions of left-wing groupthink in all three of these arenas are, by their very nature, corrupt.

Because out here in the middle of the country, that vast area between the two coasts where most Americans live, healthy masculinity abounds. Out here in the middle of the country, where regular people live regular lives, masculine men are in fact quite lovely. They love and respect women. They love their country and their families. They’re good husbands and fathers who would never dream of forsaking it all for a romp in the hay.

And the women? They love and respect men, too—as they are, not as they “should” be. They also know how to take care of themselves and say no to bad behavior. They don’t put up with nonsense from men unless they want the nonsense. And if they do, they own it. Because they know women are as flawed as men.

That is not to suggest nothing bad happens between New York and California. It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem. Greed, power and corruption—which dominate on the Coasts—is the problem. When you throw those elements into the mix, both sexes get into trouble. Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power. The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.

It’s time to call a spade a spade. All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem.

It means power is.

So what’s the answer? Either stay away from environments that are clearly corrupt and opt for a clean, simple life instead. Or go for it and know what you’re getting into. And the second you smell something untoward, which you will, do what Angelina Jolie did: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.”

In other words, you can be smart or you can be desperate. If you’re desperate for power, you will inevitably become part of the madness. If you’re smart and play your cards right, as Mayim Bialik explains in this essay, you may—may—rise above the fray.

In a perfect world, power wouldn’t cause people to behave like animals instead of like humans. But we don’t live in such a world. And here’s the most important part: none of us can change this fact. It’s human nature at its ugliest, and we can’t control it.

You can spend your life trying if you like.

But I wouldn’t recommend it.",Masculinity isn't the problem. Power is,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/masculinity-isnt-problem-power-is.html

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly.

Woods arrived in a black SUV with his attorney and bodyguards, wearing a dark suit and white shirt. Under the county’s first-time DUI diversion program, Woods will be on probation for 12 months, pay $5,000 in fines, perform 50 hours of community service and attend a DUI class. If Woods abides by the requirements of the program stays out of trouble for a year, his DUI charges will be wiped from his record.

Inside the courtroom, Woods said little, simply responding “yes”

or “no” to the judge and saying “thank you” at the end. Outside the courtroom, Woods did not respond to reporters asking him questions.

On Wednesday night, Woods was in Los Angeles at the Dodger Stadium, enjoying game two of the World Series.

For the past four years, Palm Beach County has allowed first-time DUI offenders to enter a diversion program, instead of losing their driver’s license and face possible jail time.

“Tiger Woods is being treated just like anyone would be treated here in Palm Beach County,” said former prosecutor Carissa Kranz, who said Tiger Woods’ celebrity status has no bearing on the case.

TIGER WOODS DUI ARREST SHOWN IN NEW DASH-CAM VIDEO

“Here in Palm Beach County, first-time DUI offenders have the option to knock it down to a reckless driving charge, knock it down to a reckless charge, enter a pre-trial diversion program, where they have probation, and if they complete the program successfully, adjudication can be withheld and they can actually have their record expunged. However if their record is expunged, and they get another DUI, that doesn't allow them to enter this pre-trial diversion again,” Kranz said. “There is no celebrity privilege here.”

At the end of May at about 3 a.m., Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies pulled up alongside Woods, who was parked curiously on the side of the road, asleep.

During his roadside sobriety test, Woods slurred, couldn’t walk a straight line, appeared very “out of it” and was taken to the station where he could barely keep his eyes open and struggled to blow into the breathalyzer.

That test showed no alcohol in Woods’ system, 0.0. A toxicology test, instead, showed a bunch of prescription drugs, Vicadin, Xanax, Ambien, Dilaudid as well as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Woods has had four back surgeries in the past three years, most recently fusion surgery in April.

After the arrest, Woods went to an out-of-state rehab center, which he’s tweeted helped him better manage his medications and dosages.

This week Woods tweeted out a new video, showing him hitting a “stinger”—a low, line drive, down the fairway.

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

“Once I got it, I knew what it was, and my dad was the same way,” Terry Campbell said of the object. “He didn’t use it for anything. He kept it on a shelf. We knew what it was and that was just kind of a heirloom that sat there and we looked at it.”

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner.
In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.
But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.","A painting by famed 18th century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera – long believed lost to history - may have been hanging in obscurity on the wall of a Los Angeles home for the last 60 years.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner. But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.",Cryptic letter taunts museum curator looking for missing masterpiece,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/cryptic-letter-taunts-museum-curator-looking-for-missing-masterpiece.html

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation” to publicize his memoir entitled, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice,” Khan said Kelly “indulged in defending behavior of the president and made the situation even worse.”

He criticized Kelly for standing by President Donald Trump, who engaged in a very public feud on TV and Twitter last week over Gold Star families.

Khan, the father of U.S. soldier Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, added that “restraint and dignity” should be “the call of the moment” when dealing with Gold Star families, instead of turning them into a “political football.”

His comments came more than a year after the Democrats gave him a major platform: the party's 2016 convention. Khan said on stage that Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” for America — unlike Humayun, who posthumously received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart after a suicide bomber killed him in 2004.

Trump later challenged Khizr Khan’s claims. “I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Trump said. “I work very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.”

Trump has been engaged in an ongoing feud with Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., who said she listened in to a condolence call he made last week to an Army widow. Wilson said Trump told the widow that her deceased husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.” Trump denied it.

Kelly on Thursday publicly criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call and also suggested she was trying to politicize the matter.

Wilson also suggested that Kelly, whose son was killed in Afghanistan, was forced to make public statements on the call to save his job, amid speculation that Trump is unhappy with his performance.

Khan, a Charlottesville resident, also expressed shock on “Face the Nation” about seeing Kelly “standing next to the President when the President could not have the proper words to condemn the attack on the blessed city of Charlottesville, Virginia by Neo-Nazis.”

Trump was criticized for saying “both sides” were to blame after white nationalists and alt-right groups gathered in the southern town to protest the removal of a Confederate statue on August 12, sparking violence. Police said a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car through a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse.

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

1:15 p.m.

Opponents of independence for Catalonia are holding a rally in the Spanish capital of Madrid. Thousands of people have turned out in the Plaza de Colon, many waving Spanish flags or wearing them around their shoulders.

The rally comes after one of the country's most tumultuous days in decades.

On Friday, lawmakers in the northeastern region of Catalonia passed a declaration of independence in the regional parliament. Shortly afterward, Spain's Senate gave the central government in Madrid the power to take direct control of the region and fire its separatist government.

Spain fired Catalonia's regional leaders on Saturday morning.

___

8:05 a.m.

Spain has taken direct control of Catalonia and sacked the region's defiant separatist government by publishing special measures overnight in an official gazette online.

The move early Saturday came after separatist Catalan lawmakers passed a declaration of independence on Friday.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who now replaces Catalan President Carles Puigdemont as the top decision-maker in the northeastern region, has dissolved the regional parliament and called a new regional election on Dec. 21.

Puigdemont and the 12 members of the Catalan Cabinet will no longer be paid and could be charged with usurping others' functions if they refuse to obey.

There was no immediate response from the top Catalan officials.

TIME: Noon

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Eighth-ranked Miami is unbeaten and a big favorite heading into Saturday's game at injury-depleted North Carolina.

Still, coach Mark Richt doesn't expect an easy game.

""We're just finding way to win at the end of games,"" Richt said. ""We're not foolish enough to think that we've arrived yet. I don't think they believe that. They know we have to earn it.""

The Hurricanes (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) haven't had an easy win in October, even though they sit as the lone unbeaten in the league's typically unpredictable Coastal Division. There was a win at Florida State on a touchdown with 6 seconds left, followed a week later by a win against Georgia Tech on a field goal with 4 seconds left and last weekend's 27-19 win against Syracuse.

The visit to North Carolina (1-7, 0-5) comes before two pivotal home games -- first against No. 13 Virginia Tech followed by one against No. 9 Notre Dame -- that will factor into whether Miami reaches its first ACC championship game and contends for a spot in the College Football Playoff.

Things are very different for the Tar Heels, who seem like they're just trying to get through each week.

UNC is off to its worst start in league play since going 0-6 in 2006, done in by inexperience compounded by a dizzying number of injuries. Most glaringly, the traditionally high-scoring offense has a combined 38 points in the past four games and has twice needed fourth-quarter touchdowns to avoid the first shutout of the Larry Fedora era.

UNC is coming off a 59-7 loss at Virginia Tech, the most lopsided loss of Fedora's six-year tenure, two seasons after winning 11 games and reaching the ACC title game.

""I wouldn't know how to answer that other than that I can tell the fans that I wish we were playing better,"" Fedora said when asked what he would say to fans questioning the direction of the program.

""And I wish we were winning football games. And nobody wants it more than these players and these coaches, I assure you. But I can't really worry about people that are fickle. And if they really truly understand the game of football and they really, truly love this program, they'll understand what's going on.""

Here are some other things to know about Saturday's Miami-North Carolina game:

THIN ROSTER: The Tar Heels' injury report listed 21 players as out for this game, 17 of those being out for the season. The list of those out specifically for this game includes freshman tailback Michael Carter -- who had big games against California and Virginia -- and safety Donnie Miles.

STREAKING: Miami has won 11 straight going back to last season, the second-best active streak in the country behind only South Florida's 12. The Hurricanes have also won their last eight ACC games, the best current league streak ahead of North Carolina State (five), Boston College (two) and Virginia Tech (two).

HISTORY LESSON: Miami is 124-8-1 as a Top 10 team when facing an unranked opponent. But one of those eight losses came at North Carolina in 2004 -- and there are similarities between then and now. Miami also entered that game 6-0, the Tar Heels had a losing record (3-4 then), UNC was coming off a blowout loss (46-16 to Utah in 2004), and the 2004 matchup also was on Halloween weekend.

CARDIAC 'CANES: Miami's last three wins by a combined 13 points marks its closest margin for back-to-back-to-back wins in the same season since 1992. That year, the Hurricanes beat Arizona (8-7), Florida State (17-16) and Penn State (17-14) by a combined five points. The Hurricanes went on to play for the national title that season, losing to Alabama in the Sugar Bowl.

LINE PLAY: The Tar Heels have to get something more from an underachieving offensive line, which has struggled despite having several veterans. ""They've got to play better,"" Fedora said. ""They know it. Nobody knows it better than them.""",Preview: No. 8 Miami looks to avoid letdown against dismal UNC,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/28/preview-no-8-miami-looks-to-avoid-letdown-against-dismal-unc.html

The CIA says North Korea could be just months away from being capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear strike, Reuters reported.
He said the North engages in ""outlaw"" behavior and that the U.S. would never accept a nuclear North.
“I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.
""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power.""","U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea on Saturday: Despite its ongoing missile and nuclear programs, it is simply no match for the U.S.-South Korea alliance.

“Make no mistake,” Mattis said during a news conference in Seoul, “any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.”

During the joint appearance with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, Mattis acknowledged that the threat of a nuclear missile attack by North Korea was accelerating.

The CIA says North Korea could be just months away from being capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear strike, Reuters reported.

Mattis accused the regime of Kim Jong Un of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs -- and vowed to defeat any attack.

He said the North engages in ""outlaw"" behavior and that the U.S. would never accept a nuclear North. He added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.

“North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" Mattis said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on ""a new urgency.""

“I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.

""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power."" - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis

As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip – which comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s own scheduled tour of East Asia next week -- Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North.

Mattis's comments in Seoul did not go beyond his recent statements of concern about North Korea, although he appeared to inject a stronger note about the urgency of resolving the crisis.

While he accused the North of ""outlaw"" behavior, he did not mention that President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his own rhetoric. In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen.""

Limits would be lifted

Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed that limits on South Korea conventional missile warhead payloads would be lifted. He offered no specifics.

Also discussed were the conditions under which South Korea would be given wartime operational control of its forces. Currently, if war with the North broke out, the South's forces would operate under the U.S.-led U.N. Command.

Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn't budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.

If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give - either a negotiated tempering of the North's ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power.

The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North's nuclear assets - a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States.

At his Seoul news conference, Mattis said the North is, in effect, shooting itself in the foot.

“If it remains on its current path of ballistic missiles and atomic bombs, it will be counterproductive, in effect reducing its security,"" he said.

The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.

Second visit to region

This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January. He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships.

On Friday he visited the Demilitarized Zone that forms an official buffer between the two Koreas. He appeared there with Song in what they both called a show of solidarity.

U.S. government officials for decades have confidently but mistakenly predicted the approaching collapse of North Korea, given its economic and political isolation.

Twenty years ago, Mattis's predecessor five times removed, William Cohen, said as he peered into North Korea from inside the DMZ that its communist system was ""decaying and dying."" His view was widely shared in Washington, but, like others, he underestimated the resilience of Pyongyang's family dynasty, which began with Kim Il Sung.

The current ruler assumed control of the country shortly after his father, Kim Jong-Il, died in December 2011, and has accelerated the country's nuclear and missile programs.

Lee, “Stonewall” Jackson and other Confederate soldiers has quieted down since the summer, the question about what to do with their recently-removed memorials still lingers.

Some are collecting dust in warehouses while officials search for a new home for them. Some are being handed over to the same associations that commissioned them over a hundred years ago or plopped down in cemeteries that are the final resting place for Confederate dead. One massive monument has found a new home along the banks of the Ohio River in a Kentucky historical park.

A 70-foot concrete plinth honoring Confederate soldiers had for years drawn criticism from students and faculty at the University of Louisville before it was taken down earlier this year and moved about 45 miles to Brandenburg. The monument was placed in the town’s historical walk alongside other historical statues.

Brandenburg Mayor Ronnie Joyner told Fox News that the town was not trying to honor the Confederate cause by accepting the plinth, but instead wanted to represent another aspect of American history at their outdoor museum.

“This is not a black versus white issue or something to honor the Confederacy,” Joyner said. “We’ve had the history walk since 2000 and we have statues of Native Americans and the Underground Railroad.”

Joyner added that the town has also modified the plinth with new plaques to make it a memorial to both Union and Confederate soldiers.

As for accepting any more Confederate statues, Joyner said Brandenburg won’t be taking more unless the controversy dies down. He did, however, make one exception.

“I would like to have a statue of John Hunt Morgan, but that is because he was active in these parts,” Joyner said in reference to the Confederate general who led a highly publicized raid across the Ohio River into Indiana and Ohio in 1863.

Along with historic parks, cemeteries where Confederate soldiers are buried have become another home for the removed statues.

Orlando city officials in June moved a statue known as “Johnny Reb” to a section of the nearby Greenwood Cemetery where 37 Confederate soldiers are interred.

“This is the Confederate section of the cemetery so, historically, it belongs here,” Don Price, sexton for the cemetery, told the Orlando Sentinel. “We’re the keeper of the history.”

Not all cemeteries, however, are as open to housing Confederate statues as Greenwood is.

Following the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia this summer over the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery removed its monument commemorating Confederate veterans.

Many of the cheaper, concrete statues to the Confederacy were commissioned in the early decades of last century by hereditary groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and – since the call for the removal of these monuments started up – the organizations have been taking the statues back.

In the college town of Gainesville, Fla., the United Daughters of the Confederacy were given a statue of a Confederate soldier known as “Ole Joe” earlier this year after a local history museum declined to accept it and a veterans group objected to its transfer to a nearby park. The UDC, a group that has been accused of supporting white supremacist ideas, erected the monument in 1904 in front of the Alachua County courthouse.

While some of these statues have found new homes, many more have been tucked away in warehouses in cities and towns across the U.S. as municipalities figure out what to do with them.

In Baltimore, which furtively took down a massive bronze statue of Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson in August amid threats that activists would tear them down, officials have been mulling over what to do with the memorial.

A number of universities and museums have been approached about taking the statue, but so far the city has not been able to find a suitable home for it – a fact that has been an annoyance to the Maryland state agency that oversees historical monuments.

“While the Trustees appreciate that the issues concerning relocation are complex, they also believe that establishing benchmarks are imperative to seeing this matter through to resolution,” Elizabeth Hughes, director of the Maryland Historical Trust, wrote in letter obtained by the Baltimore Sun. Hughes asked that the city find somewhere to put the monuments within nine months and secure their installation at the new location within 18 months.","Confederate statues find new homes in cemeteries, historical parks and warehouses",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/confederate-statues-find-new-homes-in-cemeteries-historical-parks-and-warehouses.html

On Thursday President Trump announced new steps to combat what he described as the worst drug crisis in U.S. history. Trump's declaration, which will be effective for 90 days and can be renewed, will allow the government to redirect resources in various ways and to expand access to medical services in rural areas.

Critics, however, have urged the government to bring new dollars to the battle against opioid abuse.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

Currently on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), “CARNE Y ARENA” tells the story of immigrants and refugees as they make their way across the American southwest desert.

In the six and a half minute experience, “the superficial lines between subject and bystander are blurred and bound together, allowing individuals to walk in a vast space and thoroughly live a fragment of the refugees’ personal journeys,” according to the LACMA’s website.

The star courted outrage on Wednesday after dedicating a tweet to the “Roar” singer on her birthday.

“Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” the star wrote over an image of her gawking, mouth agape, at Perry’s breasts.

In the wake of the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal, of which DeGeneres was an outspoken critic, dedicating part of her show to sharing her thoughts on the “#MeToo” movement, many fans were quick to mention the idea that this tweet wouldn’t fly had a man posted it. Many began responding to the tweet with the hashtag “#doublestandard.” Others went as far as to compare her to Weinstein and call her a “pig.”

As The Wrap notes, actor Michael Rapaport caught wind of the tweet and voiced his displeasure to Ellen, arguing that “the world would stop” if a man had sent this tweet.

Piers Morgan too speculated that, had a man tweeted something similar, Ellen would be leading the “cries of ‘SEXIST PIG!’”

Previously, the star dedicated her opening monologue to denouncing the growing environment of sexual harassment in Hollywood with an impassioned speech.

“This is not a male thing or a female thing, it is not a Hollywood or political thing, this is a human thing and it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world and we are all the same,” she said. “We all want the same thing, we want respect, love and kindness.

The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.

The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.

""You can hold that uniform up with one finger,"" said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.

While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.

The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.

HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES

U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.

The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.

The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.

In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.

The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be ""a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years.""

The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested. These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Army’s statement.

Setting out in March 2016 against wild weather, critics, and the odds alike, the spry outdoorsman made his final step of the journey on Oct. 26 — and officially became the oldest hiker to thru-hike the trail.

“I feel numb right now. It’s really a euphoric experience,” Sanders said, according to Outside magazine. “I’m just so thankful to the people who have helped me. I literally would not be here if it weren’t for all the people who encouraged me along the way.”

Affectionately nicknamed “Greybeard,"" Sanders broke Lee Barry’s record, who completed the hike at age 81 in 2004. Taking a “flip-flop” approach to the trail, Sanders traveled from Georgia to West Virginia, before going north to Maine and back again to the Mountain State. This popular adjustment allows hikers to trek in fairer weather conditions before tackling the northernmost part of the A.T.

According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, 2,650 adventurers set out each year to hike the A.T. in its totality, but Sanders’ journey in particular is remarkable from the start. For starters, he is older than the trail itself, as it was officially christened in 1937, the Washington Post notes. And while on the trail, he even met young Elie Quirin, who is poised to become A.T.'s youngest-ever hiker to date.

While Sanders has much to celebrate now, the experience came with its fair share of scares. In August, his journey nearly ended when he began internally bleeding in Maine’s Hundred-Mile Wilderness, heading home to Tennessee for ten days to be treated for a ruptured hemorrhoid.

Sanders said that the episode stole his confidence and he “almost didn’t come back” until a friend convinced him to return, and even accompanying back to the trail. Though Sanders had never hiked for more than two weeks before setting out for the A.T., it was not his first serious outdoor escapade.

In his youth, Sanders broke the record for underwater-breath-holding in 1959, and was IUSA spearfishing athlete of the year in 1965, the Washington Post notes. A Navy veteran and lifelong parks and recreation professional, at age 80, he paddled the entire Mississippi River in support of juvenile diabetes research.

The article, written by Van Gosse, a history professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Penn., was published Monday and seeks to explain how “putative Irishmen” such as former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and ex-White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon “are now the face of the hard Right.”

Fox News' Sean Hannity fired back, calling the article ""a disgusting, ignorant display of bigotry.""

""Perhaps Newsweek should learn the history of people like my Grandparents who came to this country with no money, faced discrimination and poverty all in the hopes that their children and grandchildren could have a better life.

""Newsweek is a disgrace, and to publish such hatred and bigotry in this day and age is beyond the pale,"" Hannity added. ""Likely the reason Newsweek is a failing publication.""

Gosse, who says he is a quarter Irish-American on his father's side, asked in the article, ""Why has the ascent of a bunch of people who in an earlier period might have been called Micks drawn no notice at all?""

He said the rise of the likes of Buchanan and Bannon, as well as Hannity, are not accidental. Gosse links it to former U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who in the 1950s fueled fears of widespread Communism.

Gosse wrote, that by the 1960s, Irish Catholics, once in the periphery of American society, had “finally made it and become fully ‘white.’”

“Having fought their way to full inclusion, many were intent on pulling up the drawbridge,” he wrote.

“Jump forward to the present…Irish America has lost virtually all its distinctive qualities, becoming just one more version of whiteness colored by ethnicity,” Gosse wrote, adding someone saying they are “Irish Catholic” is like saying they are “Midwestern.”

“The only thing “Irish” about them is a talent for invective, which makes for a compelling style, a mix of pugnacity and certainty,” Gosse continued. “They are smart, articulate, and not at all embarrassed, especially when their opinions are vicious.”

Readers were quick to point out the bias in Gosse’s words, some calling the piece “racist” and demanding Newsweek apologize to Irish-Americans.

“Some major bigotry going on here. What was newsweek thinking publishing racist diatribe?!?” one reader commented.

Another wrote: “This reads like an old fashioned Wasp wishing the Irish knew their place.”

“I'm second generation Irish American on my father's side,"" another critic commented. ""I'm not usually bothered by Irish stereotypes. But this article is so dripping with ignorance it's jaw dropping and utterly offensive. Replace the word 'Irish' with any other ethnicity and it would never have gone to print and/or the author would've been fired. I'm stunned that a person of such ignorance is allowed to teach.”

Gosse and Newsweek did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real.
It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem.
Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power.
The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.","Yet another anti-male group has emerged, this time in Washington D.C. It’s called Rethink Masculinity, and it is billed as a community where “people identifying as men” learn how social constructs of masculinity are harmful and then subsequently work to construct “healthier” ways to be men. The program joins a host of other like-minded initiatives, most of which are on college campuses—such as the Men’s Project at the University of Wisconsin, Masculinity 101 at Brown, and the Duke Men’s Project.

The goal of these programs is always the same: “to help men examine their own biases and behaviors in order to cut down on misogyny and gender-based violence,” writes Olivia Campbell at New York magazine.

Adds Campbell, “There’s no doubt the problems these classes aim to tackle are pervasive ones — a reality that’s been made especially, painfully clear in recent days and weeks, as the Harvey Weinstein revelations have pushed discussions of sexual assault and harassment to the forefront. But can a class really be enough to chip away at something so deeply entrenched?”

Probably not, notes Eric Mankowski, associate chair of the psychology department at Portland State University. “A single class is unlikely to undo years of socialization in toxic masculinity.”

Years of socialization in toxic masculinity. Right, because the recent events regarding men behaving badly, whether in the media, in Hollywood, or even on college campuses, couldn’t possibly be anything but that.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem. It means power is.

It couldn’t possibly be that the stories about which we’re far too privy represent the basest of the base—individual human beings who lack basic decency and character and who do not represent an entire sex. It couldn’t be that we know too much for our own good and at the same time know nothing specific about the events themselves. It couldn’t be that women on campus or in Hollywood or in the media are culpable in any way—because we all know women are always innocent and men, well, are not. It couldn’t be that those bastions of left-wing groupthink in all three of these arenas are, by their very nature, corrupt.

Because out here in the middle of the country, that vast area between the two coasts where most Americans live, healthy masculinity abounds. Out here in the middle of the country, where regular people live regular lives, masculine men are in fact quite lovely. They love and respect women. They love their country and their families. They’re good husbands and fathers who would never dream of forsaking it all for a romp in the hay.

And the women? They love and respect men, too—as they are, not as they “should” be. They also know how to take care of themselves and say no to bad behavior. They don’t put up with nonsense from men unless they want the nonsense. And if they do, they own it. Because they know women are as flawed as men.

That is not to suggest nothing bad happens between New York and California. It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem. Greed, power and corruption—which dominate on the Coasts—is the problem. When you throw those elements into the mix, both sexes get into trouble. Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power. The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.

It’s time to call a spade a spade. All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem.

It means power is.

So what’s the answer? Either stay away from environments that are clearly corrupt and opt for a clean, simple life instead. Or go for it and know what you’re getting into. And the second you smell something untoward, which you will, do what Angelina Jolie did: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.”

In other words, you can be smart or you can be desperate. If you’re desperate for power, you will inevitably become part of the madness. If you’re smart and play your cards right, as Mayim Bialik explains in this essay, you may—may—rise above the fray.

In a perfect world, power wouldn’t cause people to behave like animals instead of like humans. But we don’t live in such a world. And here’s the most important part: none of us can change this fact. It’s human nature at its ugliest, and we can’t control it.

You can spend your life trying if you like.

But I wouldn’t recommend it.",Masculinity isn't the problem. Power is,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/masculinity-isnt-problem-power-is.html

“The worst comments have to be the ones along the lines of, ‘No more baby in that belly,’ or ‘Start eating more so your baby can grow,’” she said.

Kousoukas has a medical condition that causes her uterus to grow “backwards,” she says in her caption explaining why her baby bump looks the way it does.

“For the first four months of my pregnancy, my uterus was retroverted/tilted, which means that I was growing backwards into my body rather than outwards,” her caption reads.

A post shared by Yiota Kouzoukas (@yiota) on Oct 1, 2017 at 2:12am PDT

While a fetus cannot grow “backwards,” reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at CCRM Boston, Dr. Aaron Styer, points out, a backward tilt of the uterus can skew the size of a baby bump.

The common condition – affecting about one in five pregnant women – is “normal and does not increase a woman’s risk for infertility or miscarriage,” Dr. Styer says. But it is just one of the factors Kousoukas is dealing with in her pregnancy, which she explained on Instagram “for the reason of educating” people on the differences people experience during pregnancy.

“My uterus didn’t 'flip forward' until well into being 4 months pregnant because of the backwards tilted position paired with decade old endometriosis scarring that I have on my uterosacral ligaments. Basically, these ligaments are acting like anchors keeping my uterus 'inside' rather than 'outside', which is why I appeared smaller than most people for the first 4 or 5 months.”

Hillary Clinton’s campaign didn’t just pay for the Kremlin-aided smear job on Donald Trump before the election; she continued to use the dirt after the election to frame her humiliating loss as a Russian conspiracy to steal the election.

Bitter to the core, she and her campaign aides hatched a scheme, just 24 hours after conceding the race, to spoon-feed the dirty rumors to an eager liberal media and manufacture the narrative Russia secretly colluded with her neophyte foe to sabotage her coronation.

Maybe at one time, but no longer. Now it’s the right to express one’s pain and the duty to attend to the Pain Monster the lies within us.

And the oh-so delicate students at many colleges and universities across the country are eager to share their inner pain with all who will listen – and demand to be sheltered from anything that could cause yet more inner turmoil.

In times past, the college student who tells you of his pain for some imagined slight would have been scolded and mocked for his self-indulgent, bruised feelings. If you’re so thin-skinned, grow thicker skin, we’d have told him. Grow up. But we don’t talk like that anymore.

We’ve been sensitized and disciplined and sued when we talk like that. As a result we’ve grown the wobbliest and most spineless generation the country has ever seen. Bear in mind, I’m talking about the adults administrators and professors at America’s colleges, not the students. The students are just taking their cues from us. When they profit from our indulgence they show themselves braver than we are, if more malevolent.

Through our weakness, through our unwillingness to discipline infantilized behavior, we’ve created the Pain Monsters at Yale University, Middlebury College, Evergreen State College and a growing number of other colleges. We’ve signaled that they can behave as outrageously as they want, so long as they justify themselves by uttering the magic words: “I want to talk about my pain.”

There are few colleges and universities that coddle students more than Yale, and few where students are more privileged. Any 18-year-old accepted there should feel a tremendous sense of gratitude. For many, a Yale degree will open doors to prestigious graduate schools, high-paying jobs, and entry into the ranks of our nation’s wealthy and powerful elite.

But students soon learn better than to be grateful for their good fortune after arriving at Yale. Instead they’re taught to express their hatred for anyone in authority, for anyone who deviates in the slightest way from the latest progressive orthodoxies.

When the head of one residential college at Yale asked students to listen to other views, one of them yelled at him: “Why the f--- did you accept the position? Who the f--- hired you? You should step down!” When the college head patiently replied, the student answered: “You should not sleep at night! You are disgusting!” Students later complained that they were so traumatized by the college head that that they were having breakdowns.

Incidentally, until last year the title of heads of residential colleges at Yale was “master.” But that title – taken from the “ancient collegiate tradition” at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England – was dropped because it “carries a painful and unwelcome connotation” to slavery and slave owners “that can be difficult or impossible for some students and residential college staff to ignore,” Yale announced in dropping the title.

At other colleges and universities, protesters told conservative speakers: “You’re killing us.” College Republicans were told: “Your existence is a disturbance.”

We see the same thing in the unhinged Trump Derangement protests. On the anniversary of last year’s election next month, tens of thousands of progressives plan to assemble in Boston Common “to scream helplessly at the sky.” I wouldn’t advise anyone to show up in a Make American Great Again cap.

“I want to talk about my pain,” said a student at a Yale protest. It’s easy enough to deride the silly things student protestors say, but I don’t want to deny that the pain was real. We have an infinite capacity to obsess over perceived slights, to turn them into the deepest psychological wounds, and to turn that into boundless hatred.

The interesting question is not whether the pain is real. Rather, the question is why we’re seeing more of it today than in the past. And the answer is because we’ve incentivized pain. We’ve let people know that pain, even idiotic, senseless pain, can be weaponized and employed against hated opponents, whether college teachers or local conservatives. And when you incentivize something, you get more of it.

The pain is real. But it is also strategic. What comes first is the desire to justify one’s hatred, for which the pain operates as a permission slip. It makes the protestor think his hatred noble, and lets him hug himself in self-delight for reveling in the most evil of emotions.

Colleges and universities are meant to be places of learning and intellectual growth, where old assumptions and ideas are challenged – not pain-free zones where delicate sensibilities are coddled and no one is exposed to disturbing or challenging ideas. That’s a lesson we’ve somehow forgotten.","Beware the incredible 'pain monsters' we've created at Yale, Evergreen State, Middlebury and other schools",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/beware-incredible-pain-monsters-weve-created-at-yale-evergreen-state-middlebury-and-other-schools.html

Freedom isn't free -- it costs about $7,500.

That's the price for one of the giant American flags that take center-stage at sporting events around the country, a constant symbol of patriotism even amid the controversy surrounding some NFL players' decision to kneel during the national anthem.

“Even watching it on TV I still get tears in eyes and a lump in my throat,” Amy Barnett, who runs 50 Star Productions – one of the companies that rents out the flags -- told Fox News. “I love the patriotic-ness of it. The crowd loves it so much, it’s amazing.”

A post shared by Gene Michael Arciniaga (@snowboardgene) on Oct 22, 2017 at 10:03pm PDT

The Salt Lake City-based company said it has been booked for at least 120 games this year with sports teams paying around $4,000 to $7,500 to showcase the giant flags that are delivered in 14 pieces.

“Each stripe is a piece and the union is a single, solid piece,” Barnett said. The pieces are attached together to create huge American flags – some the size of entire football fields weighing 1,200 pounds – that require more than 100 volunteers to hold.

“We traditionally utilize the large flag for big games – Opening Day, 4th of July, Postseason Games, as it is a great part of the tradition of big baseball games,” Joe Jareck, director of public relations for the Los Angeles Dodgers, told Fox News.

The baseball team has been displaying American flags this week that stretch from foul line to foul line as the national anthem played during the opening two games of the World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Houston Astros have used the flag in a similar fashion during their 2017 postseason run.

“The big flag requires more than 100 volunteers to rehearse and unfurl the flag at the assigned time in pre-game,” Jareck said.

The displays – big and small -- are carrying over to football stadiums as well, in cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Indianapolis.

“We have been displaying the full-field flag during the National Anthem prior to our home games since our last season in the RCA Dome [in 2008],” Pete Ward, chief operating officer of the Indianapolis Colts, told Fox News. “We have no plans to stop doing so.”

And at high school football homecoming games across the country, teams are also joining in on the surge of patriotism, with a viral video of a flag-filled pre-game ceremony by a California team racking up more than six million views on Facebook.

The Burroughs High School football team in Ridgecrest walking onto the field with each player carrying American flags – with Lee Greenwoods “God Bless the USA” playing in the background – was a “very emotional display,” head coach Todd Mather said.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the stands,” he told Fox News. “We never realized it would be this big.”

The school’s athletic director, Michele Lazaro, described Ridgecrest as a “very patriotic town” with a nearby Navy base, whose planes did a flyover for the game.

“We just wanted to honor our country and it’s the coaching staff that wanted to make it special for homecoming,” she said.",The story behind the massive American flags at sporting events,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/28/story-behind-massive-american-flags-at-sporting-events.html

“Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history.
And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured.","Donna Mills, who once lured audiences across the country as scheming vixen Abby Cunningham on “Knots Landing,” is returning to her comedic roots.

The 76-year-old television star is starring in the upcoming film “Best Mom” as Nana, a determined parent who seems to fail every time there is an opportunity to talk with her daughter. Some fans may see the movie as a far cry from the “Dallas” spinoff, which aired from 1979 until 1993, but Mills insisted the role was the right fit.

“I started out doing comedy,” Mills told Fox News. “The first thing I did here in Los Angeles when I first came was a show called ‘The Good Life’ with Larry Hagman. It was a half-hour comedy. It was great. I loved Larry and we had a great time together.

""The show only ran one season, mainly because it was opposite of ‘All in the Family.’ That was getting all the ratings. But then I was offered every comedy series that came along, and I didn’t want to get known as a comedy actress. So I turned everything down and waited for some drama. And I think people forget that I do comedy.”

However, just before Mills embarked on comedy, the aspiring actress starred in a 1971 thriller titled “Play Misty for Me,” which featured a first-time director, actor Clint Eastwood. Burt Reynolds, who previously worked with Mills in the 1970 series “Dan August,” was so impressed by the guest star that he recommended her to Eastwood, who instantly hired Mills for his directorial debut.

“I got along great with Burt,” recalled Mills. “We had a really good time. But I didn’t think I was anything extraordinary to him… About a week later I got a call saying [I] got this movie with Clint Eastwood.

""[But] apparently, Burt and Clint ran into each other at a bar one night. Clint told him, ‘I can’t find a girl I really like for this movie that I’m going to direct.’ And Burt was like, ‘I just worked with this girl… Maybe you would like her… Clint hired me from that. I never met him, I never read for him, audition — nothing… I’m always grateful for Burt.”

Mills revealed Eastwood easily impressed her with his determination to show off his directorial skills, despite already being celebrated as a Hollywood icon.

“He never directed before, so one would have thought he wouldn’t [know] what he was doing,” explained Mills. “But no, he knew exactly what he wanted… He was amazing. Absolutely amazing… He finished the movie under budget and under time… Over-budget is what you generally hear in Hollywood… I think he’s a born director, I really do. I think it was bubbling in him all the time when he was doing all the Westerns. He was just taking it all in and learning. Once he started to direct, he just took off.”

By the time “Knots Landing” came along, Mills was viewed by as “Miss Goody Two Shoes” and was eager to shed her innocent image. Even though Mills was friends with one of the show’s producers, she wanted to audition for the role of Abby and prove she was capable of playing a bad girl. The move worked, but the character would quickly impact her life when cameras stopped rolling.

“It was funny, I didn’t realize it at first,” said Mills. “When I played Abby, whenever I would meet people, a lot of the times they were kind of standoffish to me. I thought, ‘What did I do?’ I’m friendly, I’m usually pretty nice. I [didn’t] know why they were standoffish to me. So cold. And I learned — they thought I was like Abby. They thought I was Abby. So they were worried I was going to somehow do something bad to them. Steal their husbands, I don’t know. And so, I really had to fight hard to overcome that in real life.”

Still, Mills earned lasting success from the popular series. “Knots Landing” is still recognized as the second longest-running drama in TV history. She credited the show’s 14-hour work days for giving the cast flexibility to share their finest performances for viewers.

“A normal day was 14 hours, sometimes it would be 16 and on a Friday it would be 18,” said Mills. “[Quality] was the most important thing to everybody. And that had to be done right… That all takes time. The lighting, rehearsal, everything. And we never rushed it.

""We always took as much time as we needed to make it as good as we possibly could… We were happy to do it, but it was tough. It was grueling. It was exhausting… But it was a large cast, so not everyone worked every day. And that’s good or it would’ve killed ya if you worked every day.”

And the relationships Mills developed with her “Knots Landing” family endured. She still stays in touch with the cast and is even considering a secret project with two former cast mates. As for a possible “Knots Landing” reboot, Mills isn’t sure if it will ever happen, but she would happily take on Abby again if asked.

“Absolutely,” she said. “That was a once in a lifetime character… I would absolutely do it in a heartbeat. If it were up to me, I would say yes [to a reboot]. I think it would be fascinating to see where those characters are today and what they’ve experienced over the years. I think it would be fun to find out.”

But Mills isn’t sitting back and waiting. She has not slowed down since the show’s finale and is eager to do comedy again with ""Best Mom.""

“I’ve always had a lot of energy and discipline, having been a dancer,” said Mills. “But while I was raising my daughter, I didn’t work a lot mainly because I would have had to go out of town… I wasn’t going to leave her at any given amount of time to be somewhere. But once she went off to college, a bunch of stuff just fell on my lap… And I’m at a point right now where I love working. I really do. I have fallen in love with it again.”","'Knots Landing' star Donna Mills talks new comedy role, impressing Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/24/knots-landing-star-donna-mills-talks-new-comedy-role-impressing-burt-reynolds-and-clint-eastwood.html

Not only is it uncomfortable, the condition can also cause irritability, fatigue and bloating. If you suffer from constipation more than occasionally, or the problem includes severe pain or bleeding, check with your doctor to see if something more serious is going on. While there are several causes for constipation, what you eat (lots of fiber!) and drink (lots of water!) can help get things moving. In addition to drinking plenty of water, which will help make your bowel movements softer and easier to pass, here are five foods to add to your grocery list for a happier pit stop.

Mangos

The most popular fruit in the world, mangos are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as fiber to aid digestion. But it might be more than the fiber in mangos that helps get things moving. A recent study conducted at Texas A&M University found that people with chronic constipation supplemented with a mango supplement (the equivalent of one medium-sized mango a day) showed a more significant reduction in constipation in a four-week period compared to people receiving a non-mango fiber supplement. The researchers believe the phytochemicals in mango pulp were responsible for the better response on constipation, as well as inflammatory markers.

Flaxseeds

Known as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. In one small study, 55 people with constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) found that those who took flaxseeds not only reduced constipation but also showed a reduction in abdominal pain and bloating as compared to those who used psyllium (a fiber supplement). Like all sources of fiber, drink lots of water when consuming flaxseed and if you choose to include them in your diet, gradually work your way up to 2 tablespoons per day. Since our bodies can’t break down the whole seed, grind them (you can use a coffee grinder) directly before adding them to your food to get the most nutrients.

Broccoli

A powerhouse of nutrients, broccoli also contains fiber for digestive health. In addition, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables contain an antioxidant called sulforaphane, which has been shown to lower the risk of chronic inflammation and help protect the lining of the stomach from bacterial overgrowth. Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.

Yogurt

Yogurt contains tens of millions of live beneficial bacteria called probiotics. Probiotics promote a healthy gut while decreasing inflammation. A research review of 14 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that on average, probiotics slowed “gut transit time” by 12.4 hours, increased the number of weekly bowel movements by 1.3, and helped soften stools, making them easier to pass. You can also get probiotics in fermented foods like Kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi.

Pears

If you’re feeling constipated and bloated, you’re going to want to keep the skin on these sweet treats. The skin of the pear has been shown to have about half of the pear’s total fiber. The skin of the pear also contains three to four times as many antioxidants and anti-inflammatory flavonoids as the flesh of the pear alone. Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.",5 foods that help relieve constipation,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/27/5-foods-that-help-relieve-constipation.html

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

While institutional support may help, it is not enough to solve the nationwide epidemic of student hunger.
Colleges and universities can take two relatively inexpensive actions to reduce student hunger.","Many students at colleges and universities across the nation aren’t just hungry for knowledge. They’re hungry for food. And they need help.

A survey of more than 33,000 students at 70 community colleges published by researchers at the University of Wisconsin in March found that two-thirds experience food insecurity at times. The study defines food insecurity as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate or safe food. The same survey found 14 percent of community college students are homeless.

And a survey last year by four campus-based organizations of nearly 3,800 students at 34 four-year colleges and community colleges found that 48 percent reported food insecurity in the past 30 days, including 22 percent who went hungry at times.

Many Americans are unaware the problem of student hunger exists, believing incorrectly that low-income students can get scholarships, loans and part-time jobs that provide enough money to meet their food and housing needs.

Unfortunately, skyrocketing tuition and room and board costs at both public and private colleges have risen far faster than inflation and funding for scholarships and loans in recent decades. For example, the College Board reports that the average published cost of tuition and fees at a public four-year college – when measured in constant 2017 dollars – rose from $3,190 in 1987-88 to $9,970 in the current academic year. For private non-profit colleges the same costs in 2017 dollars went from $15,160 in 1987-88 to $34,740 this year.

It’s easier for people to acknowledge hunger among community college students. When it comes to four-year colleges, the ivory tower casts a long shadow of stigma over many first-generation and low-income students. The assumption is that if they are privileged to be accepted to college – especially a selective private school – they’ve made it. So when students can’t afford to eat, there is shame.

I’m a first-generation low-income student myself, and I’ve experienced food insecurity and hunger. So I know the hardships of students around our country who are forced to regularly skip meals and can’t afford foods needed to maintain good health.

Making it into college isn’t supposed to make you feel like a ravenous rat is gnawing at the pit of your stomach while you’re sitting in class trying to focus on your professor, or trying to write a paper or study for a test.

Studies show that students who encounter barriers to basic needs are less likely to get good grades, and are more likely to stop and drop out. When students work long hours at low-paying jobs so they can afford food and shelter they have less time for their schoolwork and their grades often suffer, leading them to leave school.

I’m currently a student at Hamline University, a private school in St. Paul, Minn. Thanks to a scholarship from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation I can afford a college education and my days of not having enough to eat are behind me. But with a husband who is also a student and three young children, money is still tight.

As a teenager I dropped out of high school to take a low-wage job to help my mother pay the bills. After getting a GED and fighting a serious illness that left me unable to work for seven years and required me to undergo 12 surgeries, I received an associate degree from a community college before heading to Hamline last year.

At Hamline, an astounding 76 percent of students responding to a recent survey reported experiencing hunger during the last academic year. This problem is not new, or unique to Hamline. But conversations about poverty at selective colleges are often taboo.

If colleges and universities want to commit to retention and success of low-income students, they need to start by opening resource centers on campus. Using food as a gateway, these centers help students secure access to sufficient and safe nutrition, housing, clothing, health care, child care, scholarships and other nonacademic needs. By partnering with existing local nonprofits, campus leaders can lower costs associated with operating such a center.

According to the College and University Food Bank Alliance, 500 colleges now have a food pantry. Unfortunately, Hamline is not one of them. I’m among the students working to get one started.

The costs of attending college are higher than ever. Even so, education is billed as the most reliable vehicle out of poverty. Because of this, more students from low-income families are becoming first-generation college students with the help of scholarships.

But without non-academic supports such as food pantries, the rising costs of attending college effectively force students – even those holding part-time jobs – to finance basic needs like food and housing with student loans and credit cards that saddle them with debt for many years.

While institutional support may help, it is not enough to solve the nationwide epidemic of student hunger. Innovative and collaborative resources are needed at every level.

Some places, such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, are going a step further. Thanks to relentless advocating by recent graduate Brooke Evans, the university will become the first college in the nation to allow low-income students to use the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) on campus. Every college in the nation should follow this example,

The federal government should open up more anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs to low-income students, and expand the Pell Grant program to help such students pay for college costs. This will, of course, cost money. But young people who get college degrees will earn much more and pay much more in taxes over the course of their working careers and will strengthen our economy. So in the long run, they will more than pay back any assistance they get in college.

Colleges and universities can take two relatively inexpensive actions to reduce student hunger.

First, begin conversations on campus on student poverty, and how it affects the student experience. And then follow up with action to address the systemic inequity that exists on college campuses. The Hamline Feed Your Brain Campaign is a collective of students (myself included) seeking to do this, arguing that healthy and plentiful food is needed to reach peak learning performance.

Reuer made headlines earlier this week after revealing she dropped nearly 80 pounds during the last two years and successfully completed a Tough Mudder race in June.

The 67-year-old now weighs 120 pounds but was once 198. She told Fox News on Friday that she started her wellness journey by cutting out carbs, sugar and rice. But her initial goal wasn’t necessarily to lose weight, she said. Rather, the Farmington Hills, Mich. resident just wanted to live a healthier lifestyle.

“I’m one of six siblings, and the other five have significant health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. While I hadn’t developed any of those things, I knew I would if I didn’t change how I was eating,” she said.

She also said her job encouraged her to better her lifestyle. Reuer is the CEO of Dryer Vent Wizard, a dryer vent cleaning service. She described her job as “high-stress.”

“To keep doing it as I get older, I knew I needed to be in a better condition than I was two years ago,” she said.

Just by changing her eating habits, Reuer quickly dropped 50 pounds. “When I started to lose weight, it was fun,” she said.

Even though she was thinner, Reuer said she still felt self-conscious about going to the gym at first -- wary of other gym-goers who might watch or judge her.

When she did start going, “I couldn't do push up or pull ups, and I was sore and tired,” she said.

But Reuer was determined to get stronger-- eventually hiring a personal trainer to help her on her fitness journey. As she slowly built up her strength and stamina, people started to take note.

A month after she started working out, Reuer said that Jason Kapica, the executive vice president of Dryer Vent Wizard, asked her to take part in a Tough Mudder race-- a 10 to 12 mile endurance race where participants run, scale walls, climb ropes, and more. Kapica wanted to raise money for the Children’s Burn Foundation, bit was hesitant at first to enter the competition.

“I told him I’ve never done anything like that,” she said. “I thought it was funny he even asked.”

Reuer told Kapica that she would support him and the company would sponsor him-- but she wasn’t going to take part.

But her outlook changed when she thought about the children she would be helping by participating in the race. While working with her trainer one day, Reuer made it official.

“My trainer looked at me and said, ‘OK-- we have some work to do.’”

For the next nine months, Reuer went to the gym six days a week. As the race got closer, she went two times a day, six days a week.

“I just kept thinking about trying to help these kids,” Reuer said.

Before she knew it, it was race day.

“I remember thinking: ‘What am I doing here?’” Reuer said. But all her pre-race jitters vanished after she starting running-- successfully taking on many of the obstacles even after a fellow racer told her she looked “too frail” to climb one of the walls.

“I may have white hair, but that’s an assumption I would never make about someone,” she said.

The race may be over, but that’s not stopping Reuer from maintaining her fitness journey. Reuer is still working with a trainer and continues to go to the gym six days a week.

“I’m proud of myself. But I’m happier to see what’s beenhappening around me,” she said.

Reuer said her weight loss has inspired others around her—her husband and many of her employees have embraced their own wellness journeys and lost weight as a result.

In addition, her company now offers free personal trainer sessions to employees. Employees can also use an hour of their work day to go to the gym, she said.

“That has been the most fun thing and has made the proudest,” she said.

As for her next goal? Reuer wants to tackle some of the Tough Mudder obstacles she wasn’t quite strong enough to conquer the first time round, so she plans on participating in the race again this summer. Other than that, she wants to make sure she doesn’t become part of the 65 percent of dieters who eventually return to their pre-diet weight.

The assessment from D.C.-based security intelligence consultancy Soufan Group has revised the count of ISIS militants from Tunisia from 6,000 in 2015 to the current number of 2,920. By comparison, Russian nationals who have joined the ranks of the terror group have jumped from 2,400 in 2015 to a current number of approximately 3,417.

Russian security officials long have been worried about the threat that returning Russian nationals could pose. ISIS even has an affiliate in the country’s North Caucasus region. The extremist group has killed over a dozen security forces in Chechnya in recent years.

Past ISIS terror plots in both Moscow and St. Petersburg have been foiled by Russian intelligence officers, and their Air Force has been conducting an airstrike campaign against the terror group in Syria.

Soufan’s report also points out that the overall number of ISIS fighters from foreign lands has increased since its last count in 2015.

Since the end of 2015, “gateway” countries like Turkey have made greater efforts to stem the flow of jihadis to Iraq and Syria. As a result, “the flow of fighters came to a virtual standstill as the Islamic State began to lose its territory in both Syria and Iraq.”

A majority of those who traveled to both countries either have been killed, surrendered themselves to enemy forces or have returned home, which has presented security challenges across the West.

Capping off the top five in the Soufan Group’s report is Saudi Arabia, which increased from 2,500 fighters in 2015 to 3,244. Jordan now has approximately 3,000. Tunisia and France has about 1,910.

It’s likely that the numbers will not increase from current levels due to the heavy military presence and increased security around Iraq and Syria.

Some fighters have returned to their native countries. Russia has had 400 return and both Saudi Arabia and Tunisia have seen about 800 return.

Mourners filled the Christ the Rock Community Church in suburban Fort Lauderdale, as the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson held the arm of an Army officer as she led her family inside.

The family asked reporters remain outside.

Johnson, 25, was one of the four U.S. Special Forces – or Green Berets – killed in the Oct. 4 ambush by militants linked to the Islamic State group in Niger. Three other soldiers were killed in the attack.

For an hour before the service on Saturday, Debbie Valin and her teenage daughter, Michelle Sawn, stood outside the church holding a U.S. flag.

“We are here for the military. We are grateful for the people who serve,” Valin told reporters.

Fred Walker, a Marine veteran, planted small flags along the driveway to the church.

“It’s about doing the right thing for the soldiers. They are not acknowledged enough,” he said.

A public viewing was held at the church on Friday night.

According to the Miami Herald, the evening was focuses solely on Johnson, a father of two with a third on the way.

He was remembered as “a leader” and a “lovable, humble, peaceful person.”

A college scholarship fund for his children – Ah’leeysa, 6; La David Jr., 2; and a daughter expected in January. The GoFundMe account had raised more than $634,000 in donations as of early Saturday afternoon.

The fight between Trump and Rep. Frederica Wilson has taken the focus off Johnson. It began Tuesday when the Miami-area Democrat said Trump told Johnson’s widow, Myeshia, in a phone call that her husband ""knew what he signed up for"" and didn't appear to know his name, a version later backed up by Johnson's aunt. Wilson was riding with Johnson's family to meet the body and heard the call on speakerphone. She was principal of a school Johnson's father attended.

Trump tweeted Wilson ""fabricated"" his statement and the fight escalated through the week. Trump in other tweets called her ""wacky"" and accused her of ""SECRETLY"" listening to the phone call.

Trump's chief of staff, John Kelly, entered the fray on Thursday. Kelly asserted that the congresswoman had delivered a 2015 speech at an FBI field office dedication in which she ""talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building,"" rather than keeping the focus on the fallen agents for which it was named. Video of the speech contradicted his recollection.

Wilson, who is black, fired back Friday when she told The New York Times ""The White House itself is full white supremacists.""

The retorts persisted on Saturday morning, with Trump tweeting: ""I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!""

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

The USS Ashland, part of the Navy's 7th Fleet, picked up Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiaba, both from Honolulu, after they were discovered 900 miles southeast of Japan by a Taiwanese fishing vessel.

The mariners had originally set sail with their two dogs from Hawaii to Tahiti this spring. After having engine problems on May 30 during bad weather, the two thought they could make it to land by using only their sail, according to the Navy.

Two months later, way after when they were originally supposed to arrive in Tahiti, Appel and Fuiaba began to issue distress calls.

""The two continued the calls daily, but they were not close enough to other vessels or shore stations to receive them,"" the Navy said.

The pair survived so long at sea by bringing water purifiers and over a year's worth of food on board, primarily in the form of dry goods such as oatmeal, pasta and rice, according to Appel.

""I'm grateful for their service to our country. They saved our lives,"" Appel said. ""The pride and smiles we had when we saw [U.S. Navy] on the horizon was pure relief.""

It wasn’t immediately clear who could be indicted and what the charges could be; however, the Wall Street Journal reported at least one person could be taken into custody as early as Monday.

The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge.

Possible targets in the probe include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whose house was raised by FBI agents earlier this summer, as well as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago – for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017. In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.

Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.

The special counsel's office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges. There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a “dossier” on Donald Trump is bombshell news. More bombshells are to come.

The Fusion GPS saga isn’t over. The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm’s walls. We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it?

The answers are in Fusion’s bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure. So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.

FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.

Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team—despite reading like “the National Enquirer,” as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn’t know, which would be equally disturbing.",The Coming Russia Bombshells,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/27/coming-russia-bombshells#commenting

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Halperin said he went to counseling to work on his issues and he did not engage in the same behavior while he was employed at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime.

MARK HALPERIN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY TWO MORE WOMEN

Halperin’s apology was released near the time CNN, which first published a report Wednesday detailing the sexual harassment allegations, came out with another article of four more women coming forward with new accusations, The Washington Post reported.

CNN reported one woman claimed Halperin masturbated in front of her while another woman said the “Game Change” co-author threw her against a restaurant window and threatened to derail her career after she rebuffed him.

Some of the allegations against him claim that, while working at ABC News, he grabbed a woman’s breasts without consent and pressed his clothed and erect penis against three of his co-workers.

Several employees suggested that his behavior was common knowledge, including former ABC correspondent Clarissa Ward who described it as “an open secret.”

Following the allegations, Penguin Press canceled a planned book by Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2016 election and HBO called off a miniseries that would have been based on the book. Halperin and Heilemann had collaborated on two previous books, including ""Game Change,"" a best-seller about the 2008 race that almost single-handedly revived the campaign book genre and was the basis for an award-winning HBO adaptation.

The small sword was owned by Col. Jonathan Pettibone of the 18th (Connecticut) Regiment, who fought in the battles for New York in 1776. Pettibone, of Simsbury, Connecticut, died in Rye, New York, in September of that year, shortly after the Battle of Long Island.

“With the rare maker's hallmark, and considering who owned it and the history it probably saw, this sword is truly one of the most fascinating Revolutionary War weapons I have ever seen,” said Dr. Philip Mead, chief historian and director of curatorial affairs at the Museum, in a statement.

The Museum received the sword Wednesday from donor B. Owen Williams of Maryland, a descendent of Pettibone.

“As a family, we are delighted that the Museum will provide a home for this article, where it should be, in an exhibit to be seen by the many visitors who come to the Museum from all over,” said Williams, in the statement. “I’m thrilled that it has survived in remarkably good condition despite my youthful exuberance and blissful ignorance to play with it surreptitiously as a boy.”

After Pettibone’s death the sword was passed on to his son Jonathan Pettibone Jr., who also served in the Revolutionary War.

President Donald Trump, the one man able to block the release, did not appreciate their persistence. He did not intend to make this easy.

Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, Thursday's release of 2,800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth. It came together only at the last minute, with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated Trump continuing to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.

The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies. He again flashed his skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference. Intelligence officials, meanwhile, were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.

And those officials had their own story tell, some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on Trump's expectations for the documents. The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process. The person, who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the goal was to have all the agency's documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.

Since taking office, Trump has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders, moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.

Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day, Trump was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions. The president earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents, heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades. Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.

Just before the release Thursday, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had ""no choice"" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security. Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.

""The president and White House have been very clear with all agencies for weeks: They must be transparent and disclose all information possible,"" White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said Friday.

Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly, White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg. Trump made it clear he was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.

Trump's tweets, an official said, were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously his threats to release the documents in their entirety.

According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests. But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.

On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part. Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be ""extremely circumspect"" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.

""After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,"" Trump wrote in a Friday tweet. ""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.""

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Remember to also …

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Keep a copy of your inventory offsite.

California native, Bob Holmes is one of the 16 million people in the U.S. who suffer major depressive episodes each year. Holmes has suffered from depression his entire life, and has tried several different medications to help but nothing seemed to work.

""They tried to adjust my medication but the medication had side effects that weren't desirable,” Holmes said.

Doctors at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA Health are taking a different approach to help patients.

Instead of drugs, they’re beaming magnetic pulses deep inside a patient's brain to change the way depression symptoms are perceived. It's called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS and it's currently FDA approved to treat depression only.

""The idea [is] that by using non-chemical means we can change the brain and how it functions,"" Dr. Andrew Leuchter, director of the Semel Institute’s TMS clinical and research service, said. “By pulsing it [the brain] with energy repeatedly, we're changing the way that area works, but also changing the way the whole brain network works.""

TRUMP DECLARES OPIOID EPIDEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY – HERE’S WHAT THAT MEANS

Doctors said it could also prove helpful in a wide range of conditions like schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain, by rewiring a network of signals in the brain.

""What TMS is doing is changing how that network functions, really rebooting the network to improve symptoms of mood, anxiety and chronic pain,” Leuchter said.

Leuchter also said the newest generation of TMS equipment could make treatments less time-consuming. Patients could see treatment sessions cut from 37 minutes to 3 minutes, and can complete a full course in just two weeks.

Several patients treated with TMS for depression said the therapy also helped to relieve their pain, which raises the question about whether TMS could one day become an alternative to opioids.

""This is a really transformative kind of therapy. But, in medicine there's always the wish to do better, to help more people than what we do now,"" Dr. Ian Cook, the director of the UCLA Depression Research and Clinic Program, said.

Doctors have reported that the treatment can feel a bit uncomfortable at first but patients get used to it quickly and find substantial relief from their depression within a few weeks.

Jobe, a Christian worship leader, was on tour with other worship artists last year when she had a dream about healing the nation.

“Jesus really is the answer,” she said. “I know people say that a lot, but it really is the truth. And the simplicity of the cross. Sometimes people try to make it so complex or that it’s about these rules and regulations, but it’s not. It’s about a relationship with Jesus.”

The singer-songwriter known for “Forever” and “I Am Not Alone” has been singing on a yearlong tour, leading worship in cities across the United States.

Jobe talked with Fox News about her song “Heal Our Land” before stepping onstage at the Playstation Theater in the heart of Times Square.

“I had this dream on the tour that it was raining inside this church,” she said.

“It was just like a pure water all over the floor of this church that was just like washing the floor, but it was like pure and clean. It wasn’t murky and dirty like you would imagine,” she said.

“When I woke up, it just felt prophetic,” Jobe said, adding the dream felt very intentional from the Lord and it was only confirmed after she discussed it with other worship leaders at the time.

“It just felt like God was trying to say, as a reminder, that he wants to come back for a pure and spotless bride,” she said referring to Jesus’ relationship with the church in the New Testament. “It’s his heart to come back for us, but we’re not there yet.”

Jobe wrote the worship song with her friend, singer-songwriter Brooke Ligertwood.

“I told her I wanted to write something that has to do with the church, the bride of Christ getting back to where we need to be. You know, like, what’s going on in the world around us – what could we be praying, what could the church be singing that would really help.”

The song’s bridge is based on the scripture from 2 Chronicles 7:14, a verse that has been invoked by many Christian leaders for national prayer gatherings and other revival events.

The verse reads, “If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

Jobe said, ""The rest of the song is really just a prayer for the church to be singing, to have a pure heart, to be unified, not to be divided, not be against anything but only for what God wants us to be doing,” she said.

She said the response has been really powerful.

“I feel like when we go into it every night, people just sing it at the top of their lungs,” the worship leader said. “I think it’s just one of those songs that people just connect to because there are so many unknowns right now, and so much fear people are dealing with, and with what’s going on in our nation.”

Ultimately, Jobe believes our land can only be healed by God and she hopes to continue to bring more people into a deeper relationship with Christ through her music and through the rest of The Garden Tour, which ends in December.

“What’s really special is this tour has been almost like we’re bringing buckets of water to people, and just helping them feel refreshed, and feel like, ‘Oh, yeah, I don’t have to do this by myself, but God is for me,’ and that they’re being reminded of the power of faith and the power of prayer,” she said.

“That God is moved by faith. So a song like ‘Heal Our Land,’ and declaring these things of God we pray, we humble ourselves, we seek your face. God said that if we would do that, He would heal our land, and I think they’re experiencing that on these nights of worship.”",Kari Jobe: Jesus is 'the answer' to healing the nation,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/kari-jobe-jesus-is-answer-to-healing-nation.html

Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first.","For any liberal to entertain winning the Democratic nomination for president these days, there are some important boxes to be checked, including taking on America’s system of law and order. Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has begun checking the boxes.

Zuckerberg has hired Hillary Clinton’s pollster. He’s hired Barack Obama’s campaign manager. He’s even visited the first presidential caucus state of Iowa. And he’s pandering to the left’s machine by funding a campaign that aims to get rid of our nation’s bail system.

In the dangerous push to end our current bail system, liberals like Zuckerberg are arguing that people across America are being wrongly held in jail because they can’t afford to post bail. This is ridiculous. Our bail system is in place to keep law-abiding Americans safe and to ensure that a person accused of a crime actually appears in court so justice is served.

States that have attempted to pass bail reform policies are seeing the failures of unsecured release up close. Harris County in Texas is fighting a federal lawsuit claiming its bail schedule is unconstitutional and that it keeps poor people in jail.

Chief U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal issued a federal order requiring Harris County to make immediate changes to its pretrial release system. The order requires the sheriff’s office to release anyone charged with a misdemeanor offense on unsecured release within 24 hours.

According to Harris County data since the order took effect, 32 percent of defendants released on unsecured bond have failed to appear for court, compared to only 4 percent released on a surety bond. Failures to appear cause havoc and long delays in the criminal justice system. Justice cannot be served if the accused does not appear for court.

Examples of such releases are occurring in other jurisdictions around the country. A New Jersey theater employee was arrested after law enforcement officers found a bullet-proof vest, grenade, guns and ammunition in his vehicle, causing the theater to be evacuated. He was determined not to be a danger to the community and released on unsecured bond under the new law.

New Jersey’s liberal bail reforms caused one state legislator to send a letter to the speaker of the state Assembly in California regarding a similar bill circulating in his state. The letter states that “dangerous and career criminals are released daily within hours of arrest” with no accountability. He urged the California Legislature not to make the same mistake.

While everyone is innocent until proven guilty, judges are right to set bail for individuals who are charged with a crime. Too many are simply being sent back into the poorest neighborhoods, which proponents of bail reform like Zuckerberg don’t live in.

These released individuals, many of whom are repeat offenders, walk out of jail and continue to victimize the very people proponents of bail reform claim to protect – the poor and indigent.

Unsecured release methods and the use of flawed risk assessment tools are coming under fire every day. The Arnold Foundation, which developed a risk assessment tool being used by several jurisdictions such as New Jersey, is a defendant in a federal lawsuit seeking damages in a wrongful death case.

A career criminal, who had been arrested on felony gun charges days earlier, was released on unsecured means using the Arnold Foundation’s risk assessment tool and then allegedly committed murder.

Elitists like Zuckerberg try to make the argument that the bail system is unfair to poor people, but fail to understand that law-abiding citizens regardless of income level expect laws to be enforced that will keep them safe.

There is nothing safe about the bail reforms currently being implemented and under consideration. Liberals roll out examples of people being held for minor and non-violent crimes who are forced to be away from their families because they couldn’t afford monetary bail. Some such examples do exist.

However, for every one of those stories, there are also stories regarding serious and violent offenders who walk out of jail with no accountability. Headlines such as “Eastside restaurant manager, employees accused of raping woman” and “Jackson zoning board member grabbed gun before child porn arrest, cops say” are all too common.

What is Zuckerberg’s answer to these headlines? Like so many other items on the left’s wish list, bail bond reform might sound good at first. However, in the real world where the rest of us live, there are plenty of concerns for tens of millions of Americans who wish to raise their families in a safe society.

Americans expect that when people are accused of stealing, selling illegal drugs, abusing others, driving drunk and otherwise breaking the law, they will appear in court. If convicted, such individuals will be punished for their crimes so that justice will be served.

As the bail bond reform debate continues and Mark Zuckerberg continues his multimillion-dollar quest to boost his standing with the far left’s power structure, I hope most Americans can understand that when it comes to thinking about reforming our bail system, it’s better to be safe than sorry.",Mark Zuckerberg and liberals seek to weaken bail system that keeps us safe,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/mark-zuckerberg-and-liberals-seek-to-weaken-bail-system-that-keeps-us-safe.html

TIME: Pregame coverage begins at 7:30 p.m.

MIAMI -- The Miami Heat are looking for payback.

The Heat (2-2) play host to the Boston Celtics (3-2) on Saturday night, and there is interesting history between the two teams.

Boston has won seven straight games against Miami, including their past four times invading AmericanAirlines Arena. The Celtics swept last season's series, 4-0.

This past offseason, Boston beat Miami again by signing forward Gordon Hayward, a player the Heat coveted as their No. 1 target in free agency. However, Hayward broke his leg on opening night and is out for the season.

Miami Heat on FOX Sports Sun

Celtics coach Brad Stevens told ESPN Boston that he expects Hayward to be back in the team environment next week so that he can be actively engaged as a mentor.

""We're going to throw him different assignments that we're working on as a staff,"" Stevens said. ""We want him to give our younger players his insight.""

Meanwhile, Miami did score one victory, in a sense, signing former Celtics power forward Kelly Olynyk as a free agent this past summer. This will be Olynyk's first game against the only pro team he had ever known prior to this season.

So far, Olynyk has delivered as expected. He is averaging 9.5 points, which is also his five-season career norm. His rebounds are slightly up from last season, from 4.8 to 6.5, and his assists are also on pace for a career high at 3.0.

Olynyk is getting increased playing time due to the absence of injured center Hassan Whiteside, who is expected to miss his fourth straight game due to a bruised knee.

Heat president Pat Riley, who was inducted into the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce Sports Hall of Champions on Thursday, said it is too early to assess his team.

""Let's get Hassan back,"" Riley said told The Miami Herald. ""That (injury) was sort of a bummer.""

The Celtics have their own injury issues. Aside from Hayward, forward Marcus Morris (knee) has yet to play this season, although he could return early next week.

Boston center Aron Baynes (right elbow) is also banged up. He played all five games this season, starting twice, but he is questionable for Saturday's game.

That leaves some interesting matchups for Saturday's contest, including Boston point guard Kyrie Irving (20.8 scoring average, 6.2 assists) against Miami counterpart Goran Dragic (19.8 points, 4.0 assists).

In the post, the Heat will rely on the 7-foot, 240-pound Olynyk, 6-9, 250-pound James Johnson (13.5 points, 6.0 rebounds) and 6-10, 245-pound rookie Bam Adebayo (2.0 points, 4.0 rebounds).

Boston will counter primarily with 6-10, 245-pound Al Horford, who is averaging 15.8 points and 8.8 rebounds.

Finally, on the wings, Miami boasts emerging talent Josh Richardson, veteran scorer Dion Waiters, defensive-minded Justise Winslow, three-point shooter Wayne Ellington and combo guard Tyler Johnson.

Boston's wings include two of the bright young stars of the game in 19-year-old rookie Jayson Tatum, who is 6-8; and second-year pro Jaylen Brown, 21, who is 6-7. They combine to average 31 points per game. Brown was the third overall pick in the 2016 draft, out of Cal. Tatum was the third overall pick this year, out of Duke.

Two more players the Celtics have drafted in the first round -- 23-year-old guards Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier -- are more proof of the stable of young and talented players on the Boston roster. They combine to average nearly 21 points per game.

WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?","Democrats are spending the closing days of Virginia’s contentious gubernatorial race trying to tie Republican nominee Ed Gillespie to this summer’s white supremacist violence in Charlottesville – something the Gillespie campaign is decrying as an “ugly character smear.”

The fight comes as Gillespie is running television ads drawing a contrast between him and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ralph Northam on the removal of Confederate statues in Virginia.

In an apparent reference to that stance on statues, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted a photo Friday of tiki torch-wielding white nationalists in Charlottesville with the caption: “Live look at Ed Gillespie campaign strategy meeting.”

Earlier this week, mailers funded by the Democratic Party of Virginia also surfaced with Gillespie and President Trump superimposed over a photo of the white supremacist protesters.

“On Tuesday, November 7th, Virginia gets to stand up to hate,” it reads.

The back of the mailer promotes the Democratic ticket with photos of Northam, lieutenant governor nominee Justin Fairfax and attorney general nominee Mark Herring.

The Gillespie campaign fired back at the attacks Friday.

“Northam, the entire Democratic ticket and CNN should condemn this ugly character smear that has no place in our Commonwealth’s political discourse,"" David Abrams, a spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, told Fox News.

Abrams referenced CNN because Fallon is a contributor there.

But Fallon stood by his tweet in an email to Fox News.

“Ed Gillespie should be ashamed of the ads he is running in this campaign,” Fallon said. “This is a vile and pathetic attempt to appeal to the Bannon wing of Donald Trump's Republican party.”

He said his tweet was in reference to Gillespie’s television ads, which also have accused Northam of being soft on MS-13, violent felons and sex offenders.

Asked if it’s fair to connect Gillespie to Charlottesville marchers, Northam’s campaign also defended the effort.

""For more than 70 days, Ed Gillespie has refused to call out Donald Trump's response to Charlottesville for what it was: disheartening and wrong,” Northam campaign spokesman David Turner told Fox News. “When the Charlottesville community wanted leadership to help them heal, he failed. Ed Gillespie should be willing to call out Donald Trump when he's wrong and because he won't, he gives voters a clear choice on Nov. 7.”

A 32-year-old counter-protester was killed by a white supremacist during the Charlottesville violence.

And at the time, Gillespie spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered at the University of Virginia.

WHO ARE ED GILLESPIE AND RALPH NORTHAM?

“As reported extensively by Virginia media, Ed strongly and repeatedly condemned the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who invaded our Commonwealth,” Abrams said Friday. “It is outrageous that Ralph Northam and his liberal allies in the national media are exploiting imagery from that tragic weekend for political points.”



The unrest in Charlottesville sparked a nationwide debate over the removal of Confederate monuments, as some of the white supremacists there had also been protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.

Trump reiterated his support for Gillespie in a tweet this week, saying Gillespie will “save our great statues/heritage!”

Gillespie’s campaign has embraced the issue as public polling in the state shows most voters are against removing the statues while even Democrats remain divided on the issue.

The Gillespie ad draws attention to Northam telling a radio station in August: ""I will do everything that I can, that I have authority to do, to remove the statues at the state level and I also will be a vocal advocate for their removal elsewhere.""

Northam has since softened his stance, saying decisions on monuments should be left to localities.

But in the ad, Gillespie says: “I’m for keeping them up, and he’s for taking them down, and that’s a big difference in November.”",Virginia governor's race: Gillespie slams Dems for 'smear' tying him to Charlottesville violence,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/virginia-governors-race-gillespie-slams-dems-for-smear-tying-him-to-charlottesville-violence.html

Hector Trujillo, 63, was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn.
Prosecutors said the former general secretary of Guatemala's soccer federation should serve more than three years in prison and pay $415,000 in restitution.
According to Trujillo's plea agreement, he would not contest any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison.
FIFA has conducted internal investigations of corruption and self-dealing.","A former judge who led Guatemala's soccer federation has become the first person sentenced in the U.S. in the FIFA world soccer corruption scandal, getting eight months in prison.



Hector Trujillo, 63, was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn. He had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy in June.



Trujillo admitted accepting nearly $200,000 in bribes from a company trying to secure sports marketing contracts.



Prosecutors said the former general secretary of Guatemala's soccer federation should serve more than three years in prison and pay $415,000 in restitution. Defense lawyers asked for no prison time for crimes between 2009 and 2016.



According to Trujillo's plea agreement, he would not contest any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison. Trujillo also agreed to forfeit $175,000. Free on $4 million bail, he has been staying in Miami.



He was arrested in December 2015 in Port Canaveral, Fla., during a Disney cruise with his family.



Prosecutors said in pre-sentence papers that Trujillo minimized the seriousness of his crime by noting he did not violate the laws of Guatemala, even as he indisputably broke FIFA rules.



""While the defendant may not have played the largest role or pocketed the most money of all of the defendants in the case, his conduct nevertheless shows that he engaged in the same type of conduct as the rest of the corrupt soccer officials who have been charged,"" prosecutors wrote. ""And that corrupt conduct requires a significant sentence.""



Defense lawyers had asked for leniency, saying the prosecution had ended Trujillo's ""successful and prominent career and tarnished his spotless reputation as a respected jurist and advocate."" They said his arrest had forced him to resign from his position as an alternate judge on Guatemala's constitutional court.



They also cited debilitating back and hip pain that worsened during several weeks of incarceration after his arrest and his subsequent home confinement.



The U.S. investigation of corruption linked to FIFA has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from more than 40 people and marketing agencies linked to soccer in the Americas since 2015.

Many of the charges involve bribes paid around the organization of regional tournaments and World Cup qualifying games.

Bruce Reznick, nicknamed “Mr. Whammy,” is known around the Brooklyn Nets court. The 81-year-old has held season tickets for 18 years and frequently uses his signature seat – right behind the basket – to heckle the other team into missing free throws. He actually upset LeBron James so much during a game, he was asked to move from his seat.

But Mr. Whammy’s sidelining antics aren’t what is getting him attention this time. It was the whopper of a kiss he planted on his wife, Mrs. Whammy.

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

The JFK files are out. Well, sort of. After President Donald Trump promised transparency in a tweet earlier in the week, thousands are still being withheld by the government after some were released Thursday night.

In another twist, CNN reported that former Clinton campaign chairman Podesta privately denied any knowledge of the payment arrangement in recent interviews with congressional investigators.","The confusion surrounding who pulled the strings on the Democrat-funded research resulting in the controversial Trump dossier has only emboldened Republicans looking to cut through the fog, amid signs the connections between the project and its overseers were murky by design.

The head of the Democratic Party suggested as much during a forum at the University of Chicago earlier this week.

While defending the Fusion GPS dossier as standard opposition research, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez maintained he only learned about the dossier “a few days ago” – before explaining how his predecessors at the DNC could have set up such a project.

“You hire a lawyer – and we hire lawyers all the time who hire third-party vendors to do their work – and so we knew that we were paying for opposition research at the DNC, but we didn’t ask questions about who they’re hiring in the context of doing their research,” Perez told The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty, when asked to explained how he could have been in the dark.

Perez, who was not at the DNC at the time, went on to defend the party’s efforts, saying “we had very strong reason to believe that Donald Trump and the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians were potentially conspiring to affect the election.”

The controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaign’s possible connections to Moscow.

The Washington Post reported this earlier week — and Fox News confirmed — that the political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

DEMS' DOSSIER DENIALS PILE UP

According to the report, the Clinton campaign and DNC paid more than $9 million to Elias’ firm Perkins Coie that, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the research. Before that, the research was backed by an unknown Republican client.

But it’s unclear how much of that $9 million went toward the dossier. And it’s unclear who exactly at the Clinton campaign and DNC might have known how it was being spent.

Perez and then-DNC leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz have denied knowledge. So have Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman John Podesta and spokesman Brian Fallon. And while Clinton herself has not spoken publicly on the matter, sources have sought to distance her from the dossier in news reports.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime” that the careful distance between the research and the political entities that helped fund it only underscores the need to “connect the dots.”

“There were so many in-between groups used to sort of shield direct control that it’s very clear that people on the one end, Russia, and on the other end, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign – they obviously wanted to create the inability to connect the dots. And when somebody goes through so many efforts through so many surrogates to keep that from happening, you have a special reason to want to connect the dots,” he said Thursday.

To what extent Russia might have been involved is unclear.

But more details could emerge soon, as Fusion GPS fights in court to keep its bank records on lockdown.

Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel wrote that the disclosure of the DNC-Clinton connection suggests “there's something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more” in those records.

“If the House wins, don't be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.'s office,” Strassel wrote.

President Trump has reveled in the recent revelations – including renewed scrutiny of a 2010 Obama-era uranium deal involving a Russian firm – using them to fuel his claims that the investigations into Russian collusion with his campaign are baseless.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” Trump tweeted Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on “Fox & Friends” that she doesn’t know which GOP candidate started backing Fusion but said Steele only got involved after the Democrats stepped in.

“Democrats have not been transparent or honest about how this started,” she said Friday.

In another twist, CNN reported that former Clinton campaign chairman Podesta privately denied any knowledge of the payment arrangement in recent interviews with congressional investigators. According to the report, sitting next to Podesta during that September interview was his attorney Marc Elias – who retained Fusion.",'We didn't ask questions': Fusion GPS link to Dems murky by design,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/didnt-ask-questions-fusion-gps-link-to-dems-murky-by-design.html

Barkov, 22, has three goals and four assists in his past four games, showing why he is regarded as one of the best young centers in the NHL. He had three points on Thursday, including two slick assists to set up Dadonov goals.

""'Barkie' is a beast out there,"" Boughner said. ""He's dynamite.""

Boughner added that ""teams are trying to keep their big boys (best scorers) away from him,"" which is a reference to Barkov's defensive prowess as well.

If there is a concern on the Panthers, it is depth among their forwards. Florida is in excellent shape at center, where is has Barkov; Vincent Trocheck, who also has 10 points; Radim Vrbata, who had a hat trick on Thursday; and captain Derek MacKenzie, who mans the fourth line and is known for defense and penalty-killing.

But on the wings, the Panthers have been caught short thanks to upper-body injuries to Connor Brickley and Colton Sceviour and a lower-body injury to Jared McCann.

To try to address that problem, Florida on Friday recalled forward Chase Balisy from Springfield of the American Hockey League. Balisy, 25, scored 17 goals and had 45 points in 76 games for Springfield last season.

The Panthers, who are missing starting goalie Roberto Luongo for the moment, are grateful to have James Reimer in the nets. He is 3-3-0 this season, and part of his success on Thursday was a direct result of the Panthers standing up for each other.

After Reimer was run over, defenseman Alex Petrovic came to his rescue and pushed back on the Ducks. And after Barkov was cross-checked to the face, Panthers winger Michael Haley started a fight.

That's what winning teams do, and right now, Florida's next opponent, the Red Wings, are not getting it done in advance of their visit to the BB&T Center.

Last season, Detroit missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989-1990 -- an impressive run halted.

This season, the Red Wings are relatively healthy -- only defenseman Danny DeKeyser (lower body) shows up on the injury report -- but are still struggling with a 4-6-1 record and their recent slump.

Jimmy Howard, 33, is still a solid goalie, but Detroit's defense has become slow and plodding, and Detroit is below average offensively as well.

Part of the problem is that some of the Wings' biggest stars have aged north of 35, including 37-year-old defenseman Niklas Kronwall and 37-year-old left winger Henrik Zetterberg.

In addition, 23-year-old center Andreas Athanasiou -- one of the team's young stars -- held out in a contract dispute and didn't play his first game until Thursday. After scoring 18 goals last year, he has zero points so far.

""We're looking for a jolt,"" Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill told the media this week. ""Hopefully, (Athanasiou) can give us that jolt.""",Preview: Hungry Panthers host slumping Red Wings,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/28/preview-hungry-panthers-host-slumping-red-wings.html

Around 5,000 left from Central Asia, of which just 500 — 10 percent — too have returned.
“Returning ISIS women is a complicated issue as many joined the fight willingly and engaged both in combat and effective recruitment of militants.","When it came to recruiting foreigners to flee the comforts of home for the battlefields of Iraq and Syria, ISIS succeeded like no other — encouraging more than 40,000 fighters from more than 110 countries to travel to the fighting fray both before and after the declaration of the “caliphate” in June 2014. Subsequently, authorities have warned about the threat of returning jihadists to their homeland and since the falls of Mosul, Raqqa and the rapidly receding footprint of ISIS, such fears have come to the forefront.

According to a new report, “Beyond the Caliphate: Foreign Fighters and the Threat of Returnees,” released this week by the Soufan Center — a Washington-based security intelligence consultancy — there are now at least 5,600 citizens or residents from 33 countries who have returned home — accounting for about 15 percent of the fighters.

The report asserts that for the United States, 129 fighters succeeded in leaving the country and only seven have returned.

Of the 5,000 residents of the European Union who flocked to Iraq and Syria, a quarter are alleged to have returned home. But in the U.K., that figure was closer to half, with some 425 of the 850 fighters who left Britain to join the self-styled caliphate back on home soil. Around 5,000 left from Central Asia, of which just 500 — 10 percent — too have returned.

The countries with the highest number of foreign fighters included Jordan at 3,000 (around 250 returned), France at 1,910 with 271 back and Morocco at 1,623 with 198 having gone home. Meanwhile, 400 of Russia’s 3,417 fighters are estimated to be back on their native soil, 147 of the 1,300 Tajikistan fighters, 800 of Tunisia’s 2,926, none of the 1,200 from Uyghurs — in China's western Xinjiang region — have returned and none of the 1,500 from Uzbekistan are believed to have crossed back into their mothership.

“This is only what we know and what official records report. What about those that are still transiting illegally and freely across borders,” Lee Oughton, security expert and global business development director of international risk management firm, the Abbey Grey Group, observed. “The borders going into the U.S. are seen as porous and could be an ideal spot for returning ISIS fighters to filter undetected back into society.”

BRITS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO FIGHT ISIS SAY THEY RETURN HOME ONLY TO BE ACCUSED OF TERRORISM

In 2015, the U.S. government estimated that roughly one in five of the aspiring American foreign fighters had been killed in the theater of war. But to-date, there are no precise numbers of how many were killed abroad and how many may have evaded into other countries to continue their cause — leaving the whereabouts of many unknown, with the potential of rebounding stateside.

The Soufan report also points out that a group which falls outside the definition of “returnee” figures are those people who have been stopped on their way to Syria or Iraq, either by their own authorities or those in a transit country.

“The members of this group will pose a particular problem as they had geared themselves up to join the caliphate only to be frustrated,” the report noted. “They will have all the fire and enthusiasm of a new recruit but none of the dampening experience of real life and death in the caliphate.”

REBUILDING RAQQA: SHOULD U.S TAXPAYERS PAY TO REBUILD THE RUINED FORMER ISIS STRONGHOLD?

A spokesperson for the FBI acknowledged to Fox News that “tracking those overseas who have fought on the battlefield is difficult,” and that they do not have firm numbers of “how many surrendered, were killed or remain unaccounted for,” but said that 300 Americans have “traveled or attempted to travel to Syria and Iraq to participate in the conflict” — which includes those who have joined other armed groups, such as the U.S.-backed YPG, Peshmerga or Free Syrian Army.

“While this number is lower in comparison to many of our international partners, we closely analyze and assess the influence groups like ISIS have on individuals located in the United States, who are inspired to commit acts of violence,” the official said. “Our number one priority is protecting the United States and our interests from terrorist attacks.”

“Of the approximate 300 U.S. fighters, according to counterterrorism statistics, approximately 40 died after traveling to Iraq or Syria, and that there is “only one known instance of a fighter returning from Syria to the U.S. and allegedly plotting an attack.”



Still, some analysts have expressed concern.

“America does not strip the citizenship of those who join ISIS, so we can’t prevent them from coming home,” said national security expert Ryan Mauro, from the Clarion Project. “A lot of these returning ISIS recruits are likely disillusioned with the caliphate, but we must not mistake disappointment with a rejection of jihadist thinking overall.”

HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY SUE ISIS, HEZBOLLAH OR THE REGIMES OF IRAN, SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA

Furthermore, the report concluded that since 2015, there “was a marked rise in the number of foreign women traveling to or, in the case of children, being born in the Islamic State,” which poses a particular problem. More than 15,000 women and children are documented to be part of ISIS — with at least 4,000 of them from the European Union, 3,417 from Russia, 3,000 from Tunisia, 1,623 from Morocco and 850 from the United Kingdom.

“Returning ISIS women is a complicated issue as many joined the fight willingly and engaged both in combat and effective recruitment of militants. Through careful assessment, those who fought willingly should be treated accordingly, along with their male counterparts,” surmised Tony Schiena, CEO of intelligence and security firm MOSIAC. “As far as indoctrinated children, they need to be placed in well-monitored de-radicalization and psychological programs and closely monitored until there is very little doubt of potential threat to civilians.”","Almost all American ISIS fighters unaccounted for, sparking fears they could slip through cracks and return",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/26/almost-all-american-isis-fighters-unaccounted-for-sparking-fears-could-slip-through-cracks-and-return.html

Freedom isn't free -- it costs about $7,500.

That's the price for one of the giant American flags that take center-stage at sporting events around the country, a constant symbol of patriotism even amid the controversy surrounding some NFL players' decision to kneel during the national anthem.

“Even watching it on TV I still get tears in eyes and a lump in my throat,” Amy Barnett, who runs 50 Star Productions – one of the companies that rents out the flags -- told Fox News. “I love the patriotic-ness of it. The crowd loves it so much, it’s amazing.”

A post shared by Gene Michael Arciniaga (@snowboardgene) on Oct 22, 2017 at 10:03pm PDT

The Salt Lake City-based company said it has been booked for at least 120 games this year with sports teams paying around $4,000 to $7,500 to showcase the giant flags that are delivered in 14 pieces.

“Each stripe is a piece and the union is a single, solid piece,” Barnett said. The pieces are attached together to create huge American flags – some the size of entire football fields weighing 1,200 pounds – that require more than 100 volunteers to hold.

“We traditionally utilize the large flag for big games – Opening Day, 4th of July, Postseason Games, as it is a great part of the tradition of big baseball games,” Joe Jareck, director of public relations for the Los Angeles Dodgers, told Fox News.

The baseball team has been displaying American flags this week that stretch from foul line to foul line as the national anthem played during the opening two games of the World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Houston Astros have used the flag in a similar fashion during their 2017 postseason run.

“The big flag requires more than 100 volunteers to rehearse and unfurl the flag at the assigned time in pre-game,” Jareck said.

The displays – big and small -- are carrying over to football stadiums as well, in cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Indianapolis.

“We have been displaying the full-field flag during the National Anthem prior to our home games since our last season in the RCA Dome [in 2008],” Pete Ward, chief operating officer of the Indianapolis Colts, told Fox News. “We have no plans to stop doing so.”

And at high school football homecoming games across the country, teams are also joining in on the surge of patriotism, with a viral video of a flag-filled pre-game ceremony by a California team racking up more than six million views on Facebook.

The Burroughs High School football team in Ridgecrest walking onto the field with each player carrying American flags – with Lee Greenwoods “God Bless the USA” playing in the background – was a “very emotional display,” head coach Todd Mather said.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the stands,” he told Fox News. “We never realized it would be this big.”

The school’s athletic director, Michele Lazaro, described Ridgecrest as a “very patriotic town” with a nearby Navy base, whose planes did a flyover for the game.

It’s easier for people to acknowledge hunger among community college students.
When it comes to four-year colleges, the ivory tower casts a long shadow of stigma over many first-generation and low-income students.
While institutional support may help, it is not enough to solve the nationwide epidemic of student hunger.
Colleges and universities can take two relatively inexpensive actions to reduce student hunger.","Many students at colleges and universities across the nation aren’t just hungry for knowledge. They’re hungry for food. And they need help.

A survey of more than 33,000 students at 70 community colleges published by researchers at the University of Wisconsin in March found that two-thirds experience food insecurity at times. The study defines food insecurity as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate or safe food. The same survey found 14 percent of community college students are homeless.

And a survey last year by four campus-based organizations of nearly 3,800 students at 34 four-year colleges and community colleges found that 48 percent reported food insecurity in the past 30 days, including 22 percent who went hungry at times.

Many Americans are unaware the problem of student hunger exists, believing incorrectly that low-income students can get scholarships, loans and part-time jobs that provide enough money to meet their food and housing needs.

Unfortunately, skyrocketing tuition and room and board costs at both public and private colleges have risen far faster than inflation and funding for scholarships and loans in recent decades. For example, the College Board reports that the average published cost of tuition and fees at a public four-year college – when measured in constant 2017 dollars – rose from $3,190 in 1987-88 to $9,970 in the current academic year. For private non-profit colleges the same costs in 2017 dollars went from $15,160 in 1987-88 to $34,740 this year.

It’s easier for people to acknowledge hunger among community college students. When it comes to four-year colleges, the ivory tower casts a long shadow of stigma over many first-generation and low-income students. The assumption is that if they are privileged to be accepted to college – especially a selective private school – they’ve made it. So when students can’t afford to eat, there is shame.

I’m a first-generation low-income student myself, and I’ve experienced food insecurity and hunger. So I know the hardships of students around our country who are forced to regularly skip meals and can’t afford foods needed to maintain good health.

Making it into college isn’t supposed to make you feel like a ravenous rat is gnawing at the pit of your stomach while you’re sitting in class trying to focus on your professor, or trying to write a paper or study for a test.

Studies show that students who encounter barriers to basic needs are less likely to get good grades, and are more likely to stop and drop out. When students work long hours at low-paying jobs so they can afford food and shelter they have less time for their schoolwork and their grades often suffer, leading them to leave school.

I’m currently a student at Hamline University, a private school in St. Paul, Minn. Thanks to a scholarship from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation I can afford a college education and my days of not having enough to eat are behind me. But with a husband who is also a student and three young children, money is still tight.

As a teenager I dropped out of high school to take a low-wage job to help my mother pay the bills. After getting a GED and fighting a serious illness that left me unable to work for seven years and required me to undergo 12 surgeries, I received an associate degree from a community college before heading to Hamline last year.

At Hamline, an astounding 76 percent of students responding to a recent survey reported experiencing hunger during the last academic year. This problem is not new, or unique to Hamline. But conversations about poverty at selective colleges are often taboo.

If colleges and universities want to commit to retention and success of low-income students, they need to start by opening resource centers on campus. Using food as a gateway, these centers help students secure access to sufficient and safe nutrition, housing, clothing, health care, child care, scholarships and other nonacademic needs. By partnering with existing local nonprofits, campus leaders can lower costs associated with operating such a center.

According to the College and University Food Bank Alliance, 500 colleges now have a food pantry. Unfortunately, Hamline is not one of them. I’m among the students working to get one started.

The costs of attending college are higher than ever. Even so, education is billed as the most reliable vehicle out of poverty. Because of this, more students from low-income families are becoming first-generation college students with the help of scholarships.

But without non-academic supports such as food pantries, the rising costs of attending college effectively force students – even those holding part-time jobs – to finance basic needs like food and housing with student loans and credit cards that saddle them with debt for many years.

While institutional support may help, it is not enough to solve the nationwide epidemic of student hunger. Innovative and collaborative resources are needed at every level.

Some places, such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, are going a step further. Thanks to relentless advocating by recent graduate Brooke Evans, the university will become the first college in the nation to allow low-income students to use the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) on campus. Every college in the nation should follow this example,

The federal government should open up more anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs to low-income students, and expand the Pell Grant program to help such students pay for college costs. This will, of course, cost money. But young people who get college degrees will earn much more and pay much more in taxes over the course of their working careers and will strengthen our economy. So in the long run, they will more than pay back any assistance they get in college.

Colleges and universities can take two relatively inexpensive actions to reduce student hunger.

First, begin conversations on campus on student poverty, and how it affects the student experience. And then follow up with action to address the systemic inequity that exists on college campuses. The Hamline Feed Your Brain Campaign is a collective of students (myself included) seeking to do this, arguing that healthy and plentiful food is needed to reach peak learning performance.

Second, partner with community-based food pantries to bring existing resources to students on campus. Hamline offers this through the Keystone Community Services’ Foodmobile. This service is available once per month.

Students are well into the fall semester and satisfying their hunger for knowledge. They have a basic human need to satisfy their hunger for food as well, and should not be forced to choose between getting an education and eating.",Hunger is a bigger problem than you think at America's colleges,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/hunger-is-bigger-problem-than-think-at-americas-colleges.html

I don't know what to make of him... I don't know what he's trying to accomplish. I know one thing, if he keeps on he's probably going to get smacked back.

On the country's perception of President Trump:

1 – President Trump.
CNN, MSNBC and Media Fails: Into every life a little rain must fall.
It’s not often that MSNBC ends up aiding President Trump, but it did so this time, boosting the argument for a border wall.","The Russian nuclear deal continues to be kept under containment by media fearful that it might contaminate their ability to attack President Trump.

In the latest development, The Hill reported that, an FBI informant was cleared to testify on the issue. “The Justice Department on Wednesday night released a former FBI informant from a confidentiality agreement, allowing him to testify before Congress about what he witnessed while undercover about the Russian nuclear industry’s efforts to win favorable decisions during the Obama administration,” the newspaper said.

None of the broadcast networks mentioned this development through Thursday evening. That’s not surprising. Hillary Clinton told C-SPAN earlier in the week that the latest allegations were “the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years.” And the media typically take their cues from top Democrat lawmakers.



“Face the Nation” moderator John Dickerson did end the network blackout of the story Sunday. His CBS report was the first of ABC, CBS and NBC to note the scandal that other outlets have tried hard to discredit. Those 69 seconds continue to be the only mention of the story.

That’s especially humorous given all the other stuff networks have time for, especially quirky stories. According to a Newsbusters analysis (hint: where I work): “The networks' blackout is all the more striking given the airtime those shows have already devoted this year to wacky conspiracy theories and urban legends, including the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, the Loch Ness monster, alien abductions, ghosts and even ‘lizard people.’”

That’s 4 minutes, 11 seconds – or nearly four times as much coverage – for the Loch Ness Monster compared to this scandal. And, even if you don’t like the story, it is notable because of all the other media coverage of Russia – 1,000 minutes on Trump-Russia collusion in 2017.

2. Sex Harassment Claims Increase: Claims of sexual harassment and assault are sweeping through the media. Two major names joined the growing list of those accused – NBC and MSNBC Senior Political Analyst Mark Halperin and prominent liberal and long-time New Republic Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier.

CNN broke the Halperin story with a damning lede: “Veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News, according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally, but were aware of it.” According to Axios, Halperin lost his TV gig, as well as a book and a TV deal.

The allegations are disturbing. “Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women,” according to CNN.

Halperin apologized for having pursued relationships with coworkers, “including some junior” to him. He is also known for authoring the book “Game Change” about the 2008 presidential election, which was later turned into a movie. He had just returned to the NBC universe earlier this year.

New Republic’s Wieseltier was set to head up a new magazine named Idea before sexual harassment allegations surfaced. According to Politico: “Wieseltier was also accused of ‘workplace harassment’ on an anonymous list (of men working in the media) circulating … that’s having reverberations in the industry.”

Wieseltier issued a formal apology: “For my offenses against some of my colleagues in the past I offer a shaken apology and ask for their forgiveness.”

HuffPost also targeted Wieseltier in a story headlined: “‘I Was Blind And Complicit and Just, Like, Did Nothing’: New Republic Staffers Speak Out.”

That article indicated the allegations were years in the making. “Soon after the long-whispered allegations concerning Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein came to light, former editors and writers at The New Republic, a 103-year-old political magazine, started emailing each other to share decades of stories about Leon Wieseltier, the magazine’s longtime literary editor.”

Those are far from the only new incidents in media. Director James Toback has more than 200 accusations against him. Celebrity photographer Terry Richardson and tech blogger Robert Scoble were two of the lesser names to be accused.

There were also celebrity accusers. Former “Hercules” actor Kevin Sorbo complained he had been harassed by the late fashion designer Gianni Versace.

Oddly, in this time of heightened awareness of harassment, TV host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted a picture of herself ogling the breasts of singer Katy Perry. DeGeneres, who came out as gay 20 years ago, commented above the photo, “Happy birthday, @KatyPerry! It’s time to bring out the big balloons!” She was much criticized on social media after the posting.

3. Flake-y News Coverage: Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake announced he wouldn’t be seeking re-election in 2018 and skewered President Trump in the process. Naturally, the media loved it. Lefty Slate described it as “Sen. Jeff Flake Announces Retirement in Scorching Speech Against Trump.” One thing notably absent from most of the coverage was how Flake was unlikely to win his primary challenge.

News outlets celebrated yet another Trump opponent and used the opportunity to talk about the left’s favorite issue – impeaching or removing Trump from office. “CBS This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell asked Flake on air about Trump: “If he is dangerous to democracy, as you say, should he be removed from office?”

Journalists lined up to compliment Flake for attacking their Public Enemy No. 1 – President Trump. CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin called Flake’s comments “extraordinary” and Politics Editor Mark Preston called it “historic.”

Preston then went on to treat Flake’s attack on President Trump like Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. “This is the type of speech that, I think, tomorrow that should be shown, should be listened to by every high school civics class, politics class, history class and the reason being is we're at a moment in time right now where there's so much divisiveness in the country,” he urged.

MSNBC pretend-conservative Joe Scarborough was thrilled by the speech, talking about the dangers of “a tyrannical president.” Then he went on a typical rant blaming Trump for the end of the GOP, saying: “What we’re seeing here is the – it’s political suicide. It's the coming end of the Republican Party where you are losing guys who are temperamentally moderate.” That last part is, no doubt, intended to include Scarborough, who used to be considered conservative but makes millions from MSNBC not to be.

4. CNN, MSNBC and Media Fails: Into every life a little rain must fall. That applies to news outlets as well. Both CNN and MSNBC had thoroughly humorous incidents this week in their quest to lead the anti-Trump resistance.

CNN produced a silly anti-Trump commercial about facts that used bananas and apples to teach the press that CNN stands behind them. “This is an apple. Some people might try to tell you that it’s a banana,” the segment begins, pretending that CNN only tells its viewers facts.

Both Daily Caller and BuzzFeed mightily mocked the commercial with the Caller adding to the CNN “Facts First” tagline: “UNLESS WE ARE REPORTING ON TRUMP.” The Blaze’s Dana Loesch won the Twitter commentary wars by snarking: “But what if it’s an apple that identifies as a banana.”

MSNBC had its own embarrassment. Reporter Jacob Soboroff went to the U.S.-Mexico border as three illegal immigrants jumped over the fence. It’s not often that MSNBC ends up aiding President Trump, but it did so this time, boosting the argument for a border wall.

5. Hurray for Hollywood: It’s a tough battle in Tinseltown this week over which star can say the most idiotic thing. First, there’s sometime comedian Kathy Griffin, fresh from hacking a phony Trump head. Now she’s angry at those who abandoned her, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who she called “The Spineless Heiress.”

Then there’s actress Lena Dunham freaking out that embattled, left-wing ESPN host Jemele Hill followed her on Twitter. “Holy s--- @jemelehill following me is like finding out definitively that God is here and she reads your blog. Fan dance.”

Long-time liberal singer/actor Harry Belafonte made the now-common Trump era comparisons to Nazi Germany, noting that “the country made a mistake and I think the next mistake might very well be the gas chamber and what happened to Jews (under) Hitler is not too far from our door.”

TV entertainment wasn’t much better than the stars. “American Horror Story: Cult” delivered an episode even crazier than usual, deploying a Nazi police officer and an incestuous threesome. Yes, this is broadcast TV.

The CW’s “Supergirl” continues to show its superpower is propaganda. The latest episode depicted Americans as anti-Mexican and anti-gay. The CW’s other superhero show “Legends of Tomorrow” introduced a Muslim superhero from the future. The character was added in a post-election fit of PC pique.","Hillary Clinton's ties to Russian uranium deal largely ignored by anti-Trump media, and other media disasters",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/hillary-clintons-ties-to-russian-uranium-deal-largely-ignored-by-anti-trump-media-and-other-media-disasters.html

Health insurance policies came in all shapes and sizes back then, some more comprehensive than others, depending on a patient’s needs.

Patients understood that health insurance was not the same thing as health care, and that it was at best a promise that sometimes went unfulfilled.

Over the years insurers gained more control of the health-care system, until I had to appeal to the insurance company to be reimbursed for a service I had already provided. Since patients no longer paid for my service directly, it was no wonder they began to think of health insurance as the same as health care.

The new system put a lot more pressure on me and other doctors. Insurers made more of a profit if they denied payment for our bills, while we continued to hold all the responsibility for providing patient care.

ObamaCare gave the insurers even more power, providing them access to a new clientele in the individual market, and allowing them to charge increasing premiums for heavily regulated policies with high deductibles. Only the biggest insurers could afford to provide this coverage – and they counted on a captive audience of patients who were mandated to buy it.

But ObamaCare didn’t work, because young healthy patients were too smart to pay such a hefty price for coverage they might never need. In 2016, there were 6.5 million of them who took the tax penalty under the law for going without health insurance – half of them under the age of 35. In 2015, the average individual mandate penalty for going without insurance was only $442 – far below the cost of a year’s worth of health insurance.

Insurers walked away when they found they couldn’t maintain a profit taking care of mostly older patients with pre-existing conditions. As a result, about 1,300 counties in the U.S. have only one insurer participating in the state exchanges for 2018.

The state exchanges are failing, as an outrageous 80 percent of enrollees receive federal subsidies, while the government has also been subsidizing co-pays and deductibles for poorer patients.

With two executive orders earlier this month, President Trump cut off some of the subsidies (for co-insurance) while at the same time allowing the creation of group association plans across state lines for small businesses and trade groups.

The hope is that more competition and choice will bring down overall premiums, with a la carte policies once again targeted to a person’s health-care needs. Skinny insurance policies – coupled with larger tax-deductible health savings accounts to help with out of pocket costs – would make life in the doctor’s office much more workable.

By contrast, the so-called Alexander-Murray bipartisan deal that has been under consideration in the Senate is simply another subsidy patch to feed the health insurance beast.

And all the subsidies in the world will not fix a broken system. In the doctor’s office, one of the most challenging moments with ObamaCare insurance is when a patient is hamstrung by her deductible and can’t have a test or treatment she needs despite a hefty (government subsidized) premium.

When a health insurance policy has both a high premium and a high deductible, the premium makes you feel entitled to health care, but the deductible keeps you from getting it.

The government bailout of a rigged system has gone far enough. It’s hard to feel sorry for a health insurance industry that earned $13.1 billion in 2016, up 46 percent from 2015.

Most of these profits came from Medicare Advantage, another government supported program, so its particularly greedy that the insurers are refusing to play ball with failing over-subsidized ObamaCare.

The time to let the state exchanges fully collapse is now. They should be replaced by expanded Federally Qualified Health Centers, America’s health-care safety net, which already take care of 22 million people – whether they have health insurance or not.

Alternatively, the federal government could simply provide Medicaid-style insurance to those who don’t otherwise have it, as President Nixon proposed in 1974.

They all want what Seattle has: Amazon. The online retail giant confirming 238 cities from across North America submitted proposals to host its second headquarters. In the U.S. only seven states don't have cities in the running and the suitors are willing to spend millions to help Amazon feel at home.

Seattle's economy did get a boost from Amazon, more than $30 billion worth for the city's economy, just from the company's investments in the city, billions more from spinoff businesses and 40,000 jobs. The Bellingham Herald noting the city's unemployment rate is below the national average.

But keeping up with the growth is an issue, the city approving hundreds of millions of dollars in transportation and utility improvements. And the nation's fastest growing city is also one of the most expensive places to live. Rents in King County up 65 percent since 2009, though the rising renting has been an issue nationwide.

FOX's Lisa Brady speaks with Toledo Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson, who says she isn't worried about the cost and says the city has a rail system and highways to make it viable, plus a seaport. Brady also chats with FOX News' Jeff Flock, who covered the story in Chicago.

7 - The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t a Plymouth Fury.
It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming.","Stephen King taught us some important lessons while ascending to his rightful place as America’s most prolific author of horror and supernatural fiction. For instance: don’t dump pig’s blood on Carrie, never stay at The Shining’s Overlook Hotel (Here’s Johnny!”), and for goodness’ sake, tread lightly when dealing with a 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine.

King’s characters didn’t have the benefit of hindsight, however, and their misfortunes still haunt many of us to this day. And for classic car lovers, no King story resonates quite like the “fear on four wheels” that we experienced on the pages of Christine—or better yet, in the 1983 film of the same name (let’s not talk about the 2016 remake). Even the original movie trailer raises the hair on the backs of our necks.

King takes the classic tale of boy-meets-girl to frightening heights when a geeky teenager named Arnie falls for a red Plymouth Fury with a sketchy past. Christine falls hard for Arnie, too, which would be roses and balloon drops if it weren’t for one tiny detail: the car is a killing machine with a long memory and a short fuse. Moral of the story: Never underestimate the fury of a Fury, particularly one that just…won’t…die.

As we hand out Halloween candy to all the little ghosts and goblins out there, here’s a little something for big kids: 10 things you may not know about the original Christine movie:

1 - More than 20 cars were required to play the role of Christine (anywhere from 23–28, depending on the source), and not all of them were Furys. Columbia Pictures placed ads across the country and gobbled up not only Furys, but Belvederes and Savoys, as well. The majority were used on screen, and the rest served as parts cars.

2 - When filming wrapped, only a few unscathed cars remained, and they went on the road to promote the film before being sold to collectors. A fourth car also escaped the crusher and ended up in private hands. One of the movie cars sold for $198,000 at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction in January 2015. By comparison, our Hagerty Valuation Tool lists the average value of a 1958 Plymouth Fury in #2 (excellent) condition at $47,700.

3 - King said he chose a 1958 Plymouth Fury as the story’s central figure because it was a “forgotten car.” The fact that the model name seems to fit its angry disposition is purely coincidental. “I didn’t want a car that already had a legend attached to it, like the ’50s Thunderbird,” King said.

4 - The movie’s opening scene, showing Christine moving along a Detroit assembly line, wasn’t in King’s book; screenwriter Bill Phillips added it. The movie, by the way, went into production before the novel was released.

5 - Whenever Christine goes into a rage, the car’s windows are blacked out to accentuate its evilness, but the darkened glass also served a higher purpose—you couldn’t see the stunt driver. The problem was, those scenes were filmed primarily at night, which made it even more difficult for the driver to see.

6 - The illusion of Christine regenerating herself was created using hydraulic pumps inside the car that were attached to the sides of a plastic-paneled body double. The pumps sucked in the sides to create the damaged version of the car, and then the film was reversed, making it appear like the car was fixing itself.

7 - The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t a Plymouth Fury. Filmmakers recorded the engine of a 1970 Mustang 428 Super Cobra Jet and used that instead.

8 - Speaking of memorable sounds, the F-word was used a lot in the dialogue, reportedly because executives thought no one would pay to see a horror film if it was rated PG, and there wasn’t enough violence to warrant an R rating.

9 - Partly to save money, filmmakers cast unknowns in the lead roles, although Scott Baio and Brooke Shields were originally considered. Some better-known actors and actresses (recognizable today, at least) appeared in the film, including Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky, and Kelly Preston. It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming. Kevin Bacon, virtually unknown at the time, was offered the lead role of Arnie, but he chose to play Ren McCormack in the blockbuster Footloose instead. Well, that certainly worked out well.

10 - If watching Christine gives you a sense of déjà vu, it’s because director John Carpenter also filmed 1978’s Halloween in the same neighborhood in South Pasadena, California, five years earlier. (Incidentally, Carpenter refused to attend Christine’s premiere, thinking his presence might be bad luck.)",Fear on wheels: 10 things you may not know about Christine,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/27/fear-on-wheels-10-things-may-not-know-about-christine.html

In a story by the New Yorker, actress Annabella Sciorra claims that Weinstein “violently raped” her, and actress Daryl Hannah says her career suffered after encounters with Weinstein.

In the early 1990s, Sciorra alleged that after dropping her off from a party, Weinstein went uninvited into her apartment and proceeded to start undressing himself as he walked around.

“He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me. I kicked and I yelled,” she said. Weinstein reportedly then held her arms up and forced her to have sex with him.

“When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg, and on my nightgown. He said, ‘I have impeccable timing,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you,’” she told the magazine.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

“And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me.”

Weinstein eventually left her after she began compulsively shaking, she said.

Sciorra told the New Yorker that she never told anyone what happened, including the police, saying that she felt “so ashamed” and “disgusting.”

In 1997, Sciorra recalled another encounter with Weinstein during which they had neighboring hotel rooms. She said he knocked on her door early one morning and she opened it without thinking.

“There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she said. “And it was horrific, because I'd been there before.”

Sciorra, 57, has had film roles in ""Jungle Fever"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" and also appeared on HBO's ""The Sopranos.""

ROSE MCGOWAN TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE WEINSTEIN ACCUSATIONS

Hannah said that when she first met Weinstein, she didn’t know about his reputation. So when he asked her hotel room number to schedule a meeting, she didn’t think much of it.

Later she heard “incessant” knocking on her hotel room door. She said she got so scared she eventually snuck out the back.

The following day, the knocking began again, the report said.

“The knocking started again and again. And I was like, ‘oh s---,’ ” Hannah recalled. “We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of huddled in the room.”

HARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSED OF RAPE BY ACTRESS NATASSIA MALTHE

Several years later, Hannah allegedly encountered Weinstein again when he somehow got a key to her hotel room and let himself in.

“He came through the living room and into the bedroom. He just burst in like a raging bull,” she told the New Yorker. “And I know with every fiber of my being that if my male makeup artist was not in that room, things would not have gone well. It was scary.”

Weinstein reportedly tried to get her to leave and go to a party with him downstairs. When she eventually got dressed, she said the party room was “completely empty.”

As a result of her encounters, Hannah told the New Yorker that her career suffered substantially. And when she told people what happened, it didn’t help.

“I did tell people about it,” she said. “And it didn’t matter.”

Hannah, 56, has had roles in ""Blade Runner, ""Wall Street,"" and ""Steel Magnolias.""",New Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations emerge,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/new-harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-accusations-emerge.html

Feldman has alleged in the past that Haim was raped at age 11 by a powerful person in Hollywood and the experience led to Haim's drug addiction issues. Feldman’s pal and “Lost Boys” costar died in 2010 at 38 from pneumonia.

Now, Feldman wants to produce a self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood, he said. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

“I propose to do this by... telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he says.

“I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations.

Earlier this month, The New York Times released an exposé stating Weinstein paid off women who accused him of sexual misconduct for decades. The New Yorker released its own investigative report of women coming forward to accuse the disgraced Hollywood producer of sexual assault and rape.

The fallout caused Weinstein to be fired from the company he co-founded with his brother Bob and kicked out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Like too many others, Ken Burns portrays the young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of the Vietnam War as pot-smoking, drug-addicted, hippie marauders.
Because of endless fairy tales told by Ken Burns and others, many Americans associate Richard Nixon with the totality and the worst events of Vietnam.
This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.
Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Washington, D.C. – When Richard Nixon was in the White House, I was in Vietnam and he was my commander-in-chief. When I was on Ronald Reagan’s National Security Council staff, I had the opportunity to brief former President Nixon on numerous occasions and came to admire his analysis of current events, insights on world affairs and compassion for our troops. His preparation for any meeting or discussion was exhaustive. His thirst for information was unquenchable and his tolerance for fools was non-existent.

Mr. Nixon’s prosecution of the war in Southeast Asia is poorly told by Ken Burns in his PBS documentary ""The Vietnam War.” That is but one of many reasons Mr. Burns’ latest work is such a disappointment and a tragic lost opportunity.

It’s sad, but I’ve come to accept that the real story of the heroic American GIs in Vietnam may never be told. Like too many others, Ken Burns portrays the young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of the Vietnam War as pot-smoking, drug-addicted, hippie marauders.

Those with whom I served were anything but. They did not commit the atrocities alleged in the unforgivable lies John Kerry described to a congressional committee so prominently featured by Mr. Burns. The troops my brother and I were blessed to lead were honorable, heroic and tenacious. They were patriotic, proud of their service, and true to their God and our country.

To depict them otherwise, as Ken Burns does, is an egregious disservice to them, the families of the fallen and to history. But his treatment of my fellow Vietnam War veterans is just the start. Some of the most blatant travesties in the film are reserved for President Nixon.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers do: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home.

Because of endless fairy tales told by Ken Burns and others, many Americans associate Richard Nixon with the totality and the worst events of Vietnam. It’s hardly evident in the Burns “documentary,” but important to note; when President Richard Nixon was elected in 1968, he inherited a nation – and a world – engulfed in discord and teetering on the brink of widespread chaos. His predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, was forced from office with a half million U.S. troops mired in combat and fierce anti-American government demonstrations across the country and in our nation’s capital.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home. It is very likely we are alive today because Richard Nixon kept his word.

That’s not the only opportunity for accuracy Mr. Burns ignored. He could have credited President Nixon with granting 18-year olds the right to vote in July 1971 with the 26th Amendment to our Constitution [does “Ken” even recall the slogan, “Old Enough to Fight – Old Enough to Vote!” He should. Burns turned 18 that same month.].

President Nixon pressed on to all but finish the war. As promised, he brought our combat units home, returned 591 Prisoners of War to their wives and families, ended the draft, leveraged the conflict to open ties with China and improved relations with the Soviet Union. He pushed both Communist giants in Beijing and Moscow to force their North Vietnamese puppet into a negotiated settlement. Yet, he is portrayed in the Burns documentary as a cold-blooded, calculating politician more interested in re-election than the lives of U.S. troops in combat.

Contrary to the film’s portrayal, Nixon had a complicated strategy to achieve “Peace with Honor.” His goal was to train and equip the South Vietnamese military to defend their own country in a process he called “Vietnamization” and thereby – withdraw American troops.

President Nixon succeeded in isolating the North Vietnamese diplomatically and negotiated a peace agreement that preserved the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own political future. Imperfect as the Saigon government was, by 1973 the South Vietnamese had many well-trained troops and units that fought well and were proud to be our allies. This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.

Despite Democrat majorities in both houses of Congress, Nixon – a deft political powerhouse – attained consistent support from America’s “Silent Majority.”

If Mr. Burns read President Nixon’s memoir or his two successive books in which the former president recounts his emotional anguish at the war’s toll – ""No More Vietnams"" and ""In the Arena"" – there is little evidence in the PBS production. Instead, Burns cherry-picks from the infamous “Nixon tapes” to brand the president as a devious manipulator, striving for mass deception – a patently false allegation.

By the time President Nixon resigned office on August 9, 1974, the Vietnam War was all but won and the South Vietnamese were confident of securing a permanent victory. But in December 1974 – three months after President Nixon departed the White House – a vengeful, Democrat-dominated Congress cut off all aid to South Vietnam.

It was a devastating blow for those to whom President Nixon had promised – not U.S. troops – but steadfast military, economic and diplomatic support. As chronicled in memoirs written afterwards in Hanoi, Moscow and Beijing, the communists celebrated. The ignominious end came with a full-scale North Vietnamese invasion five months later.

Despite the war’s tragic conclusion – and the trauma that continues to afflict our country – there is little in the Burns so-called documentary about the courage, patriotism and dedication of the U.S. troops who fought honorably, bravely, and the despicable way in which we were “welcomed” home.

The PBS “documentary” frequently reminds viewers of the “gallant nationalist fervor” among the North Vietnamese. But the South Vietnamese are portrayed as little more than conniving urchins and weak pawns of the imperialist Americans.

In a technique favored by the “Progressive-Left,” Mr. Burns uses a small cadre of anti-war U.S. and pro-Hanoi Vietnamese “eyewitnesses” to explain the complicated policies of the U.S. government. Mr. Burns apparently refused to interview Henry Kissinger, telling the Portland Press Herald he doubted “...Kissinger’s authority to adequately convey the perspectives of the U.S. government.” This alone disqualifies this “documentary” as definitive history on the Vietnam War.

Though Ken Burns and his collaborators claim otherwise, the real heroes of “The Vietnam War” were not U.S. protestors, but the troops my brother and I led. They fought valiantly for our country and the president who brought us home.

Since meeting President Nixon in the 1980s, I have always remembered how he understood the incredible sacrifice of American blood in the battlefields of Vietnam. He was dedicated to ending the war the right way and committed to sustaining American honor. He kept his promise to bring us home.

Ken Burns failed to keep his promise to tell all sides about the long and difficult war in Vietnam. Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Oliver North: PBS and Ken Burns get Vietnam – and Richard Nixon – wrong, again",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/oliver-north-pbs-and-ken-burns-get-vietnam-and-richard-nixon-wrong-again.html

When Vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson accompanied President John F. Kennedy to Dallas in November of 1963, Johnson's long political career seemed to be over. With rumors abounding that Kennedy was going to drop him from the ticket in the upcoming 1964 election, Johnson had resigned himself to returning to a quiet life on his Texas ranch.

Then an assassin's bullet forever changed Lyndon Johnson's political fortune.

In this special biography episode of ""War Stories with Oliver North,"" you'll see how a former Texas school teacher made a rapid ascent through the ranks in Washington to become a political powerhouse. Lady Bird Johnson's home movies will give you a behind-the-scenes look at three decades of her husband's life. Former speech writer Harry Mcpherson reflects on how Johnson pushed sweeping civil rights reforms and dramatically expanded federal social programs through a reluctant congress. And you'll hear how LBJ got what he wanted by using the legendary ""Johnson treatment.""

Johnson's gradual escalation of the war in Vietnam divided the country, overshadowed his domestic policies and forever tainted his administration's accomplishments. Racial violence, political assassinations and growing opposition to the war made the 1960's one of the most tumultuous decades in our nation's history. Former secretary of health, education and welfare Joseph Califano recalls how the weight of trying to lead our country through the chaos took a terrible toll on the man who envisioned America as the ""great society,"" and gives you the inside story on the night LBJ went on national television and shocked the nation.",The Life And Times Of Lyndon Baines Johnson,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/10/the-life-and-times-of-lyndon-baines-johnson/

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts.
And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Bruce Reznick, nicknamed “Mr. Whammy,” is known around the Brooklyn Nets court. The 81-year-old has held season tickets for 18 years and frequently uses his signature seat – right behind the basket – to heckle the other team into missing free throws. He actually upset LeBron James so much during a game, he was asked to move from his seat.

Born in August nearly 15 weeks early, Evans spent every possible moment at their side.

Late in the evening, Evans said goodbye to the girls and began the drive home to her husband, Jacob, and their four young sons. Less than a mile from home, Evans was involved in a crash too horrific for description. Although the investigation is still underway, the other driver was allegedly intoxicated.

It is believed Evans died instantly.

Interviewed by phone, Evans’s husband, Jacob, described the longest and most agonizing night of his life. When his wife hadn’t returned home in a reasonable amount of time, he became worried. After calls to friends and the hospital, he drove the route she would’ve taken home and in a matter of minutes was face to face with a police barricade.

The next few hours marched by like exhausted soldiers. Friends and members of his church family filled his home until finally, at 5:30 a.m., the coroner knocked on his door with one hand and held Katie’s driver’s license with the other.

“The first thing I thought was how do I tell my boys,” Evans said. Later that morning, when the moment was right, Evans gathered the three older boys for a family meeting. Evans led a discussion about God’s plan for his children. “Then I told them that God had asked them to exercise faith in (his) plan. I said their mother had been killed. The boys cried their little hearts out and I was so glad to have so many friends there to hug and hold them.”

As Evans considers his wife’s legacy, he knows it’s rooted in forgiveness. He has no doubt Katie would want friends and family to forgive the other driver. Evans says life is too short for anything other than letting go and moving on.

In fact, when he heard that since Katie’s passing some within his company were expressing anger and frustration, Evans wrote an open letter to the employees. It read:

“Obviously this is a difficult time for me and my family. It has been more difficult as I have heard that some are angry with the driver who killed my wife. Katie would not have wanted that. She was the embodiment of compassion. The hateful activities reported in the news recently troubled her greatly. She felt there was already too much anger in the world. I want you to know that I forgive the driver of that accident. Of course I am sorry that it happened. Of course I wish I could go back in time and change it, but we are all best served by moving forward with today’s reality and the best way to move forward is to honor Katie’s memory and focus on how to take care of her six children. Trials and tribulation are mandatory. Misery is optional. Happiness is a choice, sometimes a difficult choice. I confess I feel little in the way of happiness at the moment, but I am determined to be as happy as I can be and for now that is found in my profound gratitude to a generous and supportive community for the love they have wrapped around me and my family during this challenging time.”

As our interview ended, I asked Jacob Evans what final message he had for my readers. “Katie wasn’t perfect. No one is. But if you want to honor Katie, do what she did every day of her life. Go find a way to make the world a little better.”

And what better way to start than exercising a little forgiveness.","Katie Evans, loving mom killed in car crash following visit of premature twins leaves behind beautiful legacy",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/28/katie-evans-loving-mom-killed-in-car-crash-following-visit-premature-twins-leaves-behind-beautiful-legacy.html

Kennedy files, after being forced by U.S. spy agencies – of which he has been leery – to withhold thousands of still potentially sensitive documents.

""After strict consultation with General Kelly, the CIA and other agencies, I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,"" Trump tweeted. ""I am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.""

The National Archives on Thursday released 2,800 once-classified records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Behind the scenes of the much-anticipated release, Trump and his White House lawyers were purportedly until the last minute going back and forth with U.S. intelligence officials over their requests for additional redactions.

And the requests irritated Trump, who continued to resist signing off on the request, according to an account by two White House officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Late last week, Trump received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Kelly, his chief of staff; White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg.

Just before the documents’ release, Trump wrote in a memorandum that he had ""no choice"" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security.

Two aides said Trump was upset by what he perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests, adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about his expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.

According to White House officials, Trump accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests.

But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him, Trump told aides he did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.

On Thursday, Trump's top aides presented him with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests: He could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part.

Trump accepted the suggestion, ordering that agencies be ""extremely circumspect"" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.

The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of Trump's troubled relationship with his spy agencies.

Between the time Trump was elected in November 2016 and took office in January, he slammed the CIA for concluding Russia hacked Democratic Party emails to help him win the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

And Trump has been critical of how the FBI handled the investigation into then-Secretary of Clinton’s private email servers -- to the point of firing Director James Comey.

Since taking office, Trump also has moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused his predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor his campaign. In the JFK files matter, one White House official said, Trump wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.

Under a 1992 law, all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by the president.

""I wish this on nobody, nobody,"" 36-year-old Elisha Cooke-Moore tells KTVL, which has a copy of her lawsuit filed last week. Cooke-Moore says she underwent genetic testing because both her mother and grandmother had cancer.

The lawsuit claims Cooke-Moore was wrongly told the test showed she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome. She says she was told by gynecologist William Fitts that she had a 50 percent chance of getting breast cancer and an up to 80 percent chance of getting uterine cancer.

She says nurse practitioner Lori Johns recommended surgery based on the test results. Months after her surgeries, Cooke-Moore says she was reading the test results for herself and says they were clearly marked ""negative,"" the Washington Post reports.

“Quite frankly, we are stumped to why they would make this mistake,” her lawyer tells the Oregonian. The hysterectomy put Cooke-Moore into early menopause, and she says the botched mastectomy has required more than 10 corrective surgeries.

She says she's been diagnosed with PTSD.

""It's terrible,"" she says. ""As a woman, they took what God gave me. I don't even feel like I am one at times.""

The mother of five now says she should have gotten a second opinion before having the surgeries.

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

""We are living in tumultuous times, and we have many disagreements,"" Hirono said, ""but we agree that it is our responsibility as public servants and Americans to honor each veteran in the same way they honored our country.""",Filipino WWII veterans awarded Congressional Gold Medal,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/25/filipino-wwii-veterans-awarded-congressional-gold-medal.html

Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller announced the refiling of criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault, after District Justice Allen Sinclair threw out the felony charges in September against eight Beta Thea Pi fraternity members, a press release stated.

The judge let stand lesser charges against them and six others. He dismissed other charges altogether against four of the members of the fraternity.

Timothy Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, NJ, fell down a set of stairs and suffered fatal injuries after prosecutors said pledges were forced to down a dangerous amount of alcohol and were then made to run a “gauntlet” of booze-drinking stations.

Security video of the incident recorded Piazza appearing intoxicated and being led to a couch after 11 p.m. A few minutes later, he fell head-first down a set of basement stairs and had to be carried back up in an unconscious state.

For several hours, members of the fraternity appeared to take half-hearted and even counterproductive measures to tend to their injured friend, pouring liquid on him and strapping on a loaded backpack to prevent him from rolling over and choking on vomit. He died two days later on Feb. 4 at a local hospital.

Tom Kline, the attorney for the Piazza family, applauded Parks Miller’s decision to refile charges.

""The Piazza family is both pleased and supportive of the refiling of the charges in their quest for complete justice in this tragedy,"" Kline said.

And it’s for a good cause. Since October, $1 from each calendar goes to Give A Hoot, a campaign supporting breast cancer research.

Fox News spoke with the Texas native living in Hollywood about appearing in the latest Hooters calendar, how she was hired by the restaurant and the one talent she loves to show off:

Fox News: Can you describe that moment when you saw yourself on the cover for the first time?

Chelsea Morgensen: My managers first told me I was going to be doing a TV appearance, but instead they were actually surprising me with my cover. The entire restaurant was chanting my name as I came downstairs. I had no idea what was going on. And then they finally showed me the cover… I loved it. I just really loved my picture! I was so excited, the whole restaurant was cheering for me… But it didn’t actually hit me until… I saw the physical, actual calendar. I just thought, ‘Wow, this actually happened.’

A post shared by Chelsea Morgensen (@chelseamorgensen) on Oct 10, 2017 at 8:46am PDT

Fox News: When did you first became involved with Hooters?

Morgensen: I started working for Hooters in April 2015. I was actually just eating at Hooters because I love their wings and thought, ‘You know, I really need a job. I wonder if they’re hiring.’ I asked the Hooters girl there and she said, ‘Yeah! Stop in tomorrow and meet our manager.’ I went in… They pretty much hired me on the spot. It was pretty exciting. I was a bit overwhelmed, but I am glad that I pursued it. It’s been the best job I’ve ever had.

Fox News: How has working at Hooters helped you build self-confidence?

Morgensen: Just having to interact with people every day, especially working in Hollywood, people come from all over the country… I had to open up and talk to everybody. Being outgoing just in the workplace encouraged me to get out more in my regular life.

Fox News: What’s your relationship like with your customers?

Morgensen: In Hollywood, we actually have very few regulars… It’s always new customers. But recently — and I’m so excited about this — I actually created two regulars of my own that now frequent the restaurant, which is really cool!

A post shared by Chelsea Morgensen (@chelseamorgensen) on Aug 24, 2017 at 9:55pm PDT

My relationships with them are very friendly. We talk about work, travel, careers. I’m modeling and acting now, so they’re always really curious about what that’s like and see how I’m doing… If they’re ever having a down day, I try to turn it around for them. I really like having that familiar face come in. And I hope to create more of them.

Fox News: Have you interacted with any celebrities?

Morgensen: I personally have not that I know of, but there are some celebrities that come in. I know we had a football player one time who came in and ordered one of everything on the entire menu… We do have some celebrities who come in every now and then.

Fox News: Some people believe Hooters depicts women in a negative light. How do you respond to the criticism?

Morgensen: Honestly, I haven’t experienced any incidents of negativity. It has done nothing but empowered me. It has given me so much more confidence. And all the girls that work there are amazing. There are girls going to school to become nurses, become lawyers, to be doctors… I think it’s a great job… It gives you that ability to talk to anybody… I have had nothing, but positive experiences working with Hooters.

Fox News: Are there any misconceptions you feel people have that just aren’t true?

Morgensen: I think a lot of people need to visit Hooters and see it for themselves. Hooters is a great family-oriented restaurant. Families bring their kids all the time and they absolutely love it. They have a blast. So if someone has any misconceptions, they just need to come to Hooters and experience it for themselves.

Fox News: Before Hooters, you were a pageant girl in 2009. What was that like?

Morgensen: I was a tomboy my whole life… But I was tall and thin, so people would always tell me that I should model. A friend of my mom's told me there was a beauty pageant coming up and I should compete in it. It was part of the Miss Universe organization… It was in my hometown of Texas, so I competed there and ended up winning… I was so surprised, I didn’t know what I had gotten myself into… It actually led me to Hollywood and that’s where I wanted to end up.

Morgensen: I was in New York and shooting a summer line for a purse collection. It was about five degrees outside. It was also raining. I was wearing a tank top with strappy heels and little capri pants. I was just wearing that while walking around the street as photos were being taken of the purses. It was so, so cold.

Kellogg's has apologized after a member of the Social Justice Breakfast Brigade complained about racially insensitive artwork on a package of Corn Pops.

The artwork included cartoon characters shaped like corn kernels frolicking about in a shopping mall. All but one of the kernels was yellow. The lone brown kernel was working as a janitor.

Well, faster than you could say snap, crackle, pop -- a customer raised a stink on social media.

""Why is literally the only brown corn pop on the whole cereal box the janitor? This is teaching kids racism,"" aggrieved cereal-eater Saladin Ahmed wrote on Twitter.

USA Today reports Ahmed is a writer for the Marvel Comics' Black Bolt series and a fantasy novel author.

A number of folks observed that the brown kernel was the only one actually doing something – putting in a hard day’s work while other corn kernels goofed off.

I contend it’s just a cartoon on a cereal box, so why is this even a “thing”? But my opinion seems to be in the minority (no pun intended).

Kellogg's dutifully responded on Twitter - reaffirming its commitment to diversity and inclusion. In other words, they respect corn kernels of all colors and socio-economic backgrounds.

""Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion. We did not intend to offend - we apologize. The artwork is updated & will be in stores soon,"" the company stated.

Now the tech exec thinks robots will not just outsmart humans, but will have an IQ of 10,000 in the next 30 years.

Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Son, who has made countless investments in companies related to artificial intelligence ─ including chip companies Nvidia and ARM Holdings ─ stated that robots will surpass human-level intelligence rapidly and ultimately become far smarter than humanity has ever dreamed of.

STEPHEN HAWKING: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD END THE HUMAN RACE



""Singularity is the concept that [mankind's] brain will be surpassed, this is the tipping point, crossing point, that artificial intelligence, computer intelligence surpass [mankind's] brain and that is happening in this century for sure,"" Son was quoted as saying at the conference. ""I would say there is no more debate, no more doubt.""

By comparison, an average level IQ for a human is between 90 and 110. Geniuses such as Stephen Hawking have been estimated to have an IQ level around 160. However, Hawking has never taken an official intelligence test, according to a report in British newspaper The Independent.

Mensa, the self-proclaimed ""high IQ society,"" admits people to become members after they have demonstrated intelligence levels ""at or above the 98th percentile on certain standardized IQ or other approved intelligence tests."" For Stanford–Binet, the minimum accepted score is 132, whereas for the Cattell test, it is 148.

Singularity is rapidly approaching

The timeframe for singularity, the concept that machines will become smarter than the human brain, is up for debate.

In March, Google’s Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil said that by 2029 ""computers will have human-level intelligence.""

For his part, Son has repeatedly said it will happen in the ""next 30 years or so.""

He has helped position his company Softbank, which also owns a controlling stake in U.S. telecom provider Sprint, for the upcoming singularity.

In May 2017, Softbank launched the Vision Fund, which is targeting up to $100 billion in investments around the world, for companies ""that seek to enable the next age of innovation."" This includes areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile applications and computing.

Since its launch, the fund has made a number of investments, including the aforementioned stake in Nvidia, a $4 billion investment in workplace startup WeWork, and is reported to be working on a major investment in Uber, which is working on autonomous vehicles.

In addition to Softbank's investments in the AI space, it already has a humanoid robot, Pepper, which can perceive a person's emotions. Son envisions that is just the beginning, saying robots will learn by themselves and ""maybe [are] going to laugh at you and us. Today they look cute, they will stay cute, but they will be super smart.""

In August, a Pepper robot became an ordained Buddhist priest.

ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CAUSE WORLD WAR III

Perils despite the promise

While Son, 60, appears to be betting on the promise and the positive effect that intelligent robots may have on society, not everyone is on board.

Luminaries such as Hawking and tech executive Elon Musk have warned against the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, though not necessarily in robot form.

Last month, Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence could cause World War 3, following comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that the country ""who becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will be the ruler of the world.""

Hawking has also sounded the alarm bells, going so far as to say, ""The development of full artificial intelligence (AI) could spell the end of the human race.""

This past week, Sophia, a humanoid robot, became the first robot to receive citizenship of a country, being awarded citizenship in Saudi Arabia.

After it received the citizenship, Sophia was interviewed by a member of the media about concerns it could do harm to humanity. It responded, by saying, ""You've been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies. Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.""

The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office said Audrianna Cohen’s accidental death was caused by the toxic effects of carfentanil, a substance 10,000 times more potent than morphine, TribLive.com reported.

The exact circumstances of her death are unclear, although the substance can be mixed with heroin and cocaine, or used as an illicit substance substitute, the news outlet reported.

Moran worked as a long-term substitute teacher and a girls soccer coach at Stockbridge High School during the 2016-2017 school year, according to the Lansing State Journal. Moran reportedly no longer works for the school district.

The teenager testified in court during a preliminary hearing that he and Moran would eat lunch together and spend time together after school.

In March, their relationship became more intense after the teacher and student started exchanging messages on the social media app Snapchat.

""At first it was just normal...asking how I was doing,"" the teenager said. Later, the two ""started talking more in a sexual manner.""

The teenager said Moran sent nude photos of herself to him through the app.

The teenager said he was invited to Moran’s house in April. When he was inside, Moran “led him into a basement man cave then took off her robe and kissed him,” the student told the court.

Afterward, the teacher led the teen upstairs to her room where he said she sexually assaulted him. That same week the teenager went back to Moran’s residence where they had sex a second time.

George Springer and the Astros broke out the bats early this time and kept up their big run at Minute Maid Park in October, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 Friday night for a 2-1 lead in the World Series.

The ballpark was booming from the start, with cheers, chants and a loud train whistle echoing beneath the closed roof. A sellout crowd stood much of the evening — deep in the heart of football country, with every Houston batter getting a hit or walk, the fans enjoyed the Friday Night Sights.

Yuli Gurriel homered to begin a four-run burst in the second inning that sent Yu Darvish to the shortest start of his career. Astros curveballer Lance McCullers Jr. wobbled, but protected the lead into the sixth. Brad Peacock rose to the occasion with 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief.

Coming off a dramatic rally to win Game 2 at Dodger Stadium, the Astros improved to 7-0 at home this postseason. Jose Altuve & Co. have dominated, too, outscoring the Red Sox, Yankees and Dodgers 36-10 in that span.

Springer lined a leadoff double in the first and the Astros went on to win a home game for the first time in the World Series. They were swept by the White Sox in 2005, and this win put them two victories from a most elusive championship.

Game 4 will be Saturday night when Charlie Morton starts for Houston. Left-hander Alex Wood pitches for the Dodgers, facing a lineup that has put at least one runner on in 14 straight innings.

McCullers left in the sixth as Los Angeles scored twice to cut into a 5-1 deficit. Peacock followed, and shouldered the load for a shaky bullpen by posting his first save in 11 years of pro ball. The right-hander was nearly perfect, walking one and striking out four.

""It was awesome,"" said Peacock, who made 21 starts and 13 relief appearances during the regular season. ""I've never experienced anything like that in my life.""

Coupled with four shutout innings from McCullers to finish off the Yankees in Game 7 of the AL Championship Series, the unorthodox Astros became the first team to have two saves of three-plus innings in one postseason.

On a night when a lot went right for Houston, also credit third base coach Gary Pettis, who's been having quite a postseason. He boldly sent Josh Reddick careening home on a wild throw by reliever Tony Watson for a two-out run in the fifth.

The Astros rode the momentum of a thrilling victory Wednesday night in Los Angeles, where Marwin Gonzalez hit a tying homer in the ninth on an 0-2 pitch from star closer Kenley Jansen, and Houston went deep three times in extra innings before hanging on to win 7-6 in 11.

This wasn't nearly as dramatic, not that the home crowd minded.

Fans were revved up from the start when injured Houston Texas defensive end J.J. Watt — who has raised more than $37 million for relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey — wobbled out to the mound on crutches to throw the first ball.

Soon, it was time for the Houston hitters to take over.

Gurriel homered into the Crawford Boxes in left to begin the second — he became the 13th hitter already to homer in this Series. Reddick followed with a double and Evan Gattis, the designated hitter with the game in an American League park, drew a walk.

Marwin Gonzalez launched a drive off the wall in left and wound up with an RBI single when Gattis held at second, seeing if the ball would be caught. Brian McCann singled home another run, and Alex Bregman's sacrifice fly made it 4-0.

When Altuve doubled, Darvish was done after 1 2/3 innings.

""The fastball command wasn't there, and the slider was backing up. So he just really didn't have the feel and couldn't get any type of rhythm going,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.

Last month, Darvish and several Dodgers players wore Houston Strong T-shirts to raise money for hurricane relief. The four-time All-Star who previously played in Texas also contributed to the relief efforts.

On Thursday, Darvish kidded that maybe his goodwill would lead to good luck.

""Since I made that donation, maybe I can use a ball that doesn't have much pop in it,"" he said through a translator.

The bill aims to close a loophole which currently leaves models open to potential harassment on the job from people such as photographers, designers and agency employees, Moneyish reports. Because models are typically classified as independent contractors, they are often excluded from standard employment protections, but this bill would provide them protection against sexual harassment.

“There’s no accountability when it comes to who ultimately has to respond to sexual harassment in the workplace,” Rozic said to Moneyish. “The bill addresses this loophole in the law by making it an unlawful practice for a modeling entity — whether it be this talent agency or management company — to subject a model to harassment, regardless of whether they’re an independent contractor or employee.”

Rozic’s bill, which was developed with New York-based advocacy group Model Alliance, would hold modeling agencies accountable for misconduct on the job.

Which is also why so many people adore him.

Now, however, Bourdain’s actions may be catching up with him, as Buzzfeed reported the chef is now banned from ever entering the country of Azerbaijan again.

According to the Washington Post, Bourdain’s crime was entering a hotly contested territory of the country known as Nagorno-Karabakh. The region tried to succeed from Azerbaijan in 1988 in an attempt to join Armenia instead. However, Azerbaijan rejected the attempt and the region has been embroiled in conflict ever since.

Because the relationship between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh is fragile at best, someone traveling between the two areas needs special permission to do so. In fact, as the Post noted, visiting without permission from the government is considered a criminal offense.

“Without the explicit consent of and a visa issued by the authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan, a person, who made/makes a trip to the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan, will not be granted a visa to the Republic of Azerbaijan and will be deported in case of his/her future entrance,” the website for the Azerbaijani embassy states.

Currently the government holds a list containing more than 700 names of people banned from both regions because they entered Nagorno-Karabakh without permission. That list includes government officials, activists, journalists, and now, Bourdain.

Bourdain “has been put onto the persona non grata list for his disrespect of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and sovereignty,” according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hikmet Hajiyev, who spoke with Agence France-Presse. Hajiyev added, “Filming a food show on Azerbaijan's occupied territory is an insult to 1 million Azerbaijani refugees who were forcefully expelled from their homes.”

The great irony of all this though, is that the Clintons started the so-called Russian collusion scandal, and in the end, they may be the ones destroyed by it.","The Left has been desperately working for months to find any shred of evidence that Donald Trump had even the slightest connection to Russia during the presidential campaign. Despite having the full support of their friends in the media, they have consistently failed to find anything substantive.

At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president. Now, I have another theory: The Trump-Russia story is meant to serve as a pure distraction aimed at masking real corruption by the Clinton political machine.

As The Hill reported on Sunday, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, a Kremlin-linked bank paid her husband, former President Bill Clinton, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also during her tenure as top diplomat, earlier reports indicate Canadian and Russian business executives directed many millions more to the Clinton Foundation. In fact, citing recently unsealed Federal Bureau of Investigation reports, The Hill described a thorough Russian campaign aimed at gaining access to the Clintons and capitalizing on their influence, while also spying on them to advance a pro-Russia agenda. In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 so-called “sleeper cell” Russian spies who had reportedly become too close to Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also overseeing a laundry list of U.S.-Russian initiatives and dealings.

Among other things, she served on the Committee on Foreign Investment, where she voted in favor of President Obama’s approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian business, to a state-owned Russian nuclear energy outfit. At the time, the Canadian company controlled 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves.

Before the sale was approved, a Kremlin-linked bank that supported the deal paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a 90-minute speech in Moscow to promote the Uranium One’s stock. Bill then met personally with Vladimir Putin. All the while, people linked with Uranium One – and its previous incarnation UrAsia – reportedly paid the Clinton Foundation $145 million in donations.

You can’t make this stuff up, and while the news media continues to acknowledge the facts, they still claim there is no foul play on behalf of the Clintons in terms of the uranium deal. The Media Research Center found that the ABC, NBC, and CBS evening shows have “spent only 3 minutes and 1 second on the Clinton Foundation scandal in more than two years.”

In comparison, another Media Research Center report found that since Inauguration Day evening shows on these three networks have aired “1,000 minutes of coverage discussing Russia’s attempt to boost Trump in 2016, and speculation that Trump’s campaign may have colluded with the Russians in this project.”

And remember: The so-called collusion story came out of supposed opposition research we now know was funded by Clinton and her Democrat allies.

Thankfully, House and Senate Republicans have now launched new investigations into the Clintons’ ties to Russia – as well as Hillary’s illegal use of a private email server as Secretary of State. The email scandal is now even more significant given that we know that she continued to use a private, insecure email server despite the FBI arresting a ring of Russian agents who were specifically targeting her.

As I told Sean Hannity on Monday, I think we are on the edge of the greatest corruption scandal in American history.

The first thing Congress should do is demand that every single dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation and its charity initiatives be made public to show exactly where the Clintons derived their money. I suspect there are millions of foreign dollars hidden away in foreign subsidiaries that were never reported in financial disclosures.

The truth about the level of foreign donation, influence peddling, and outright corruption involved in the Clinton world could change American politics forever.

In a story by the New Yorker, actress Annabella Sciorra claims that Weinstein “violently raped” her, and actress Daryl Hannah says her career suffered after encounters with Weinstein.

In the early 1990s, Sciorra alleged that after dropping her off from a party, Weinstein went uninvited into her apartment and proceeded to start undressing himself as he walked around.

“He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me. I kicked and I yelled,” she said. Weinstein reportedly then held her arms up and forced her to have sex with him.

“When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg, and on my nightgown. He said, ‘I have impeccable timing,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you,’” she told the magazine.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN SEX SCANDAL: DETAILING THE ALLEGATIONS

“And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me.”

Weinstein eventually left her after she began compulsively shaking, she said.

Sciorra told the New Yorker that she never told anyone what happened, including the police, saying that she felt “so ashamed” and “disgusting.”

In 1997, Sciorra recalled another encounter with Weinstein during which they had neighboring hotel rooms. She said he knocked on her door early one morning and she opened it without thinking.

“There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she said. “And it was horrific, because I'd been there before.”

Sciorra, 57, has had film roles in ""Jungle Fever"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" and also appeared on HBO's ""The Sopranos.""

ROSE MCGOWAN TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE WEINSTEIN ACCUSATIONS

Hannah said that when she first met Weinstein, she didn’t know about his reputation. So when he asked her hotel room number to schedule a meeting, she didn’t think much of it.

Later she heard “incessant” knocking on her hotel room door. She said she got so scared she eventually snuck out the back.

The following day, the knocking began again, the report said.

“The knocking started again and again. And I was like, ‘oh s---,’ ” Hannah recalled. “We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of huddled in the room.”

HARVEY WEINSTEIN ACCUSED OF RAPE BY ACTRESS NATASSIA MALTHE

Several years later, Hannah allegedly encountered Weinstein again when he somehow got a key to her hotel room and let himself in.

“He came through the living room and into the bedroom. He just burst in like a raging bull,” she told the New Yorker. “And I know with every fiber of my being that if my male makeup artist was not in that room, things would not have gone well. It was scary.”

Weinstein reportedly tried to get her to leave and go to a party with him downstairs. When she eventually got dressed, she said the party room was “completely empty.”

As a result of her encounters, Hannah told the New Yorker that her career suffered substantially. And when she told people what happened, it didn’t help.

“I did tell people about it,” she said. “And it didn’t matter.”

Hannah, 56, has had roles in ""Blade Runner, ""Wall Street,"" and ""Steel Magnolias.""",New Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations emerge,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/new-harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-accusations-emerge.html

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a “dossier” on Donald Trump is bombshell news. More bombshells are to come.

The Fusion GPS saga isn’t over. The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm’s walls. We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it?

The answers are in Fusion’s bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure. So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.

FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.

Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team—despite reading like “the National Enquirer,” as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn’t know, which would be equally disturbing.",The Coming Russia Bombshells,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/27/coming-russia-bombshells

It wasn’t immediately clear who could be indicted and what the charges could be; however, the Wall Street Journal reported at least one person could be taken into custody as early as Monday.

The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge.

Possible targets in the probe include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whose house was raised by FBI agents earlier this summer, as well as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

Richard Hibey, an attorney for Manafort, told Fox News on Friday that neither he nor any of his colleagues representing Manafort had been informed of any indictment of their client.

Manafort has been the subject of a longstanding investigation into his dealings in the Ukraine several years ago – for which he did not file as a foreign agent until June 2017. In addition to his home being raided, Manafort was reportedly wiretapped by investigators before and after the 2016 presidential election.

A retired Army lieutenant general, Flynn served as a Trump surrogate during the campaign and briefly served as national security adviser before being fired over his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, who was Russia's ambassador to the United States.

Mueller has reportedly probed whether Flynn was involved in a private effort to get former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.

The special counsel's office declined to comment on the reports of filed charges. There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Trump has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend Meghan Markle was seen with natural nail shades during her first public appearance at the Invictus Games.","Kate Middleton is a fashion icon and regularly steals the show for her outfit choices, but there is one thing she never wears – colored nail polish.

For her public duties, the Duchess of Cambridge is always pictured with au naturel nails, and there is strict reason for this.

According to OK! magazine, colored nail varnish and fake nails are not part of the royal etiquette, and are typically considered to be “vulgar.""

On the rare occasion that her nails do have a slick of polish on them, she opts for a nude shade, similar to the Queen’s personal favorite.

Queen Elizabeth is said to have worn Essie's Nail Lacquer in Ballet Slippers since 1989.

According to the brand's website, Queen Elizabeth's hairdresser wrote to the brand's owner, nail polish-mogul Essie Weingarten, asking for a bottle of the light pink polish as she didn't want to wear any other.

The only time Kate has deviated from the Ballet Slippers shade was her wedding day to Prince William.

On the big day, her manicurist Marina Sandoval revealed her nails were a custom mix of Bourjois So Laque Nail Enamel in Rose Lounge and Essie Nail Polish in Allure.

It’s not just the Duchess and the Queen who have been seen abiding by the nude nail varnish dress code.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend Meghan Markle was seen with natural nail shades during her first public appearance at the Invictus Games.

Time: 5 p.m.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Austin Peay coach Will Healy wants his team to enjoy its trip to Florida, and for the Governors to upset Central Florida -- in that order.

The Governors weren't even scheduled to make this trip, but since his FCS program was added to 18th-ranked UCF's schedule Healy is treating it like a bowl game for Austin Peay.

The team arrived in Orlando on a special charter flight on Thursday -- a day early -- with the coaches' families in tow. Once on the ground, the Austin Peay contingent immediately headed to Disney World Theme Park for six hours of fun.

Austin Peay plans on Friday enjoying some time at Cocoa Beach, which is about an hour away. They will take care of some business as well, going through a walk-through practice.

The Governors will start to lock in and mentally prepare for their matchup Saturday with UCF (6-0) in what they jokingly have dubbed the ""Peay Bowl.""

""I wanted to treat this like a bowl game, down to having a bowl gift on their beds when they got there,"" said Healy, Austin Peay's second year coach. ""I wanted to make sure these kids can never have a better experience playing a college football game than what our guys are going to do this week.""

It could be dubbed the Hurricane Irma game.

Neither team was scheduled to play this weekend when the season begun, but storm forced the Knights to cancel their September home game against Georgia Tech. UCF needed an extra game and Austin Peay (5-3) was available.

Healy and his players made it work with a few conditions.

""This is going to be like a Super Bowl for them,"" UCF coach Scott Frost said of the Governors. ""They're coming down here and treating this like a bowl game. I've been on a team like theirs when I was (an assistant coach) at Northern Iowa and when you get to play an FBS team there is nothing you want more in the world than to knock a team off and beat them.

""So I know they are going to come down here hungry and our guys have to ready.""

Healy, whose team entered the season ranked last in Division I football after losing 27 straight, isn't expecting anything less than the Knights best. He understands what's at stake for UCF.

""They're fighting for something a lot bigger than just this week,"" Healy said of Frost and the Knights. ""He's got those kids' attention and they know they can do something really special this year and I think they will.""

Some other things to watch when Austin Peay visits No.18 UCF:

ON TARGET: UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton continues to have an outstanding second season, ranking second in the nation in passing efficiency (196.3) and third in passing yards per completion (16.4 yards).

HIGH OCTANE: The Knights offense struggled last week against Navy by its standards with just four touchdowns and 31 points. But UCF still has the top scoring offense in the country with 47.3 points per game.

BIG TURNAROUND: The Governors came into the season on a 27-game losing streak, which included going 0-11 during Healy's first year. They are 5-3 now and have a realistic chance of making the FCS playoffs if they can win their final three games.

COMING OFF THE EDGE: Senior Tony Guerad has been the Knights most productive defensive lineman for two seasons now. Last week against Navy, he led the D-linemen with nine tackles against the Midshipmen's triple option. Guerad also leads UCF's defensive linemen for the season 23 stops to go along with 4.5 tackles for loss.

NEW KID ON THE BLOCK: Freshman reserve Otis Anderson got his most extensive work in the Knights backfield during their game-sealing drive against late in the fourth quarter against Navy. Anderson, who is actually listed as a receiver on the depth chart, had a couple of nice runs on the drive and capped it with his first career rushing touchdown -- a 10-yard run that gave UCF the 31-21 win.","Preview: UCF, Austin Peay meet in matchup created in wake of Hurricane Irma",http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/28/preview-ucf-austin-peay-meet-in-matchup-created-in-wake-hurricane-irma.html

The threat of nuclear missile attack by North Korea is accelerating, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Saturday, accusing the North of illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear programs and pledging to repel any strike.

In remarks in Seoul with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo at his side, Mattis said North Korea engages in ""outlaw"" behavior and that the U.S. will never accept a nuclear North.

The Pentagon chief added that regardless of what the North might try, it is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.

""North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" he said, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on ""a new urgency.""

""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" Mattis said.

As he emphasized throughout his weeklong Asia trip, which included stops in Thailand and the Philippines, Mattis said diplomacy remains the preferred way to deal with the North.

""With that said,"" he added, ""make no mistake — any attack on the United States or our allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is effective and overwhelming.""

Mattis' comments did not go beyond his recent statements of concern about North Korea, although he appeared to inject a stronger note about the urgency of resolving the crisis.

While he accused the North of ""outlaw"" behavior, he did not mention that President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his own rhetoric. In August, Trump warned the North not to make any more threats against the United States, and said that if it did, it would be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen.""

Song, the South Korean minister, told the news conference that he and Mattis agreed to further cooperation on strengthening Seoul's defense capabilities, including lifting warhead payload limits on South Korean conventional missiles and supporting the country's acquisition of ""most advanced military assets."" He offered no specifics and refused to answer when asked whether the discussions included nuclear-powered submarines.

Some South Korean government officials have endorsed the nation getting nuclear-powered submarines amid calls for more military strength. There's a growing concern among the South Korean public that North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons arsenal, which may soon include an intercontinental ballistic missile that could target the U.S. mainland, would undermine Seoul's long alliance with Washington.

South Korea's conservative politicians have also called for the United States to bring back tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula in the 1990s. But Mattis and Song were strongly dismissive of the idea.

""When considering national interest, it's much better not to deploy them,"" said Song, adding that the allies would have ""sufficient means"" to respond to a North Korean nuclear attack even without placing tactical nuclear weapons in the South. Mattis said current U.S. strategic assets are already providing nuclear deterrence and that the South Korean government has never approached him with the subject of tactical nuclear weapons.

Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn't budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.

If Trump sticks to his pledge to stop the North from being able to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear attack, something will have to give — either a negotiated tempering of the North's ambitions or a U.S. acceptance of the North as a nuclear power.

The other alternative would be U.S. military action to attempt to neutralize or eliminate the North's nuclear assets - a move fraught with risk for South Korea, Japan and the United States.

Mattis touched off unease in South Korea last month when he told reporters at the Pentagon that the United States has military options for North Korea that doesn't put Seoul at risk. At Saturday's briefing, Mattis didn't offer a direct answer to what those options are or how and when they would be used.

""Our military options as I mentioned are designed to buttress the diplomats' efforts to maintain a deterrence stance and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. While the allies are committed to deterring North Korea, they also need ""many different military options that would realistically reduce that threat as low as possible,"" Mattis said.

""And yes, we do have those options,"" he said.

The North says it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.

This was Mattis's second visit to South Korea since taking office in January. He made a point of going to Seoul and Tokyo on his first overseas trip in February, saying he wanted to emphasis the importance he places on strengthening alliances and partnerships.",Pentagon chief says North Korea engages in 'outlaw' behavior,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/28/pentagon-chief-says-north-korea-engages-in-outlaw-behavior.html

The number-crunching which followed was automatic. The results were unusual.

This object is in an odd position. It’s moving very fast. And it’s in what appears to be a somewhat extreme orbit. Extreme enough not to actually be an orbit, in fact.

Observations published by the by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggest it could have come from deep space.

Specifically, it could be a comet that has escaped another star.

WHAT IS C/2017 U1?

The PanSTARRS telescope spotted the object only after it was flung back out towards the stars by our Sun.

It’s not likely to ever return. It flashed past Earth at 24 million kilometres on October 14.

Many eyes watched it closely, keen to determine exactly what it was. Their curiosity was piqued by where it had come from.

Most objects orbiting our Sun do so along a common plane: the planets, dwarf planets and asteroids mostly swing around in roughly the same way.

This one appears to have come down on the plane from 122 degrees, from the direction of the star Vega, in the constellation Lyra. And its path did not indicate the curved ellipse typical of clockwork-like returning comets.

Best guesstimates make it a comet of about 160m diameter, with a surface reflectivity (albedo) of about 10 per cent.

A WANDERER

The object has just been through a close call (in Solar System terms): it came within 38 million km of our star before its momentum and the Sun’s gravity hurled it back outward.

Normally such a close pass would be fatal. But C/2017U1 was travelling too fast for the Sun’s heat to consume it.

It was moving at 26km per second when first observed.

Astronomers are now attempting to refine their observations and data to pinpoint exactly where it came from. If it truly is of interstellar origin, the next task is to find which star it is likely to have come from.

At the moment, it appears to have been somewhere in the direction of the star Vega.

It’s also likely to have been wandering, alone, in deep space for a very, very long time.

Vega is a relatively close neighbour of our Sun at 25 light years distance. At the speed it’s travelling, it would take about 1.7 million years to cross the interstellar divide.

In a brief statement, Carles Puigdemont seemed to convey that refuses to accept his firing ordered by central authorities in Madrid, who officially took over command of the northeastern region.

“It’s very clear that the best form of defending the gains made until now is democratic opposition to article 155,” Puigdemont said.

Spain took formal direct control of Catalonia on Saturday, on paper firing the region's defiant separatist government a day after lawmakers passed a declaration of independence for the prosperous northeastern region.

The move came after one of the most tumultuous days in the country's recent history, as the national parliament in Madrid approved unprecedented constitutional measures to halt the secessionist drive by the regional parliament in Barcelona.

Spain made the takeover official by publishing special measures online early Saturday in the country's gazette.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who now replaces Puigdemont as the top decision-maker in the northeastern region, has also dissolved the regional parliament and called a new regional election to be held on Dec. 21.

Still, it was not clear at all whether a new election would solve Spain's problems with separatists in Catalonia. Polls suggest pro-independence parties would likely maintain their slim advantage in parliamentary seats but would not get more than 50 percent of the vote.

“Spain is living through a sad day,” Rajoy said. “We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf.”

Puigdemont and 12 other members of the Catalan Cabinet will no longer be paid and could face charges of usurping others’ functions if they refuse to obey. There was no immediate sign that top Catalan officials will do so, or comply with the orders.

Beyond any possible resistance from top Catalan officials, it's unclear how Rajoy's government in Madrid will be able to exert its control at lower levels of Catalonia's vast regional administration.

Catalonia had secured the ability to govern itself in many areas, including education, health and policing, since democracy returned to Spain following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.

Some among Catalonia's roughly 200,000 civil servants have said they will refuse to obey orders from Madrid. They risk being punished or even fired under the special powers granted to central authorities by the nation's Senate on Friday.

Catalonia held its independence referendum Oct. 1 and declared independence more than three weeks later. The U.S., France and Germany were among several countries who rejected the declaration.

In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.

But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows? To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them “see” with virtual reality and augmented reality.

Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of “seeing” beyond the armor to the war zone around them. The augmented reality even enhances their “sight” by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.

This remarkable advance is part of the DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles. GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.

Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph. The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the “sight” provided by the virtual reality system.

Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPA’s vision for this radical new vehicle. The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.

Far Better Armor

The big advantage to no windows? Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.

Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor. For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility. These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.

But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside. Reactive armor detects threats and reacts. So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.

Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.

PODCAST: VAMPIRE BATS V. NAVY SEALS. INSIDE JUNGLE WARFARE WITH SEAL TEAM 6

How does it work?

Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T “cockpit.”

Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers. These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of “seeing” outside the vehicle – whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.

Already, Honeywell’s virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds. This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views. DARPA’s aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.

Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality. Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.

Augmented Reality View

Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced “sight.” With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.

Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation. But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist driver’s during their missions.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR’S SHOW

Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection – these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver “sees.” Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.

In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots’ cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.

PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT

What is GXV-T?

DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways. Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.

Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy. But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth? Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.

A new kind of driving

For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor. This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.

But there is also potential for significant impact in the civilian world. Honeywell’s achievement could help pave the way to a future where civilians take advantage of the enhanced safety closed cockpits could offer and drive windowless as well. Or windshields could become transformed into displays that offer augmented reality, suggesting optimal routes to avoid traffic so drivers will never have to look down at their phones for Waze again.",Powerful tiny tanks with VR and futuristic cockpits could revolutionize the battlefield,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/26/powerful-tiny-tanks-with-vr-and-futuristic-cockpits-could-revolutionize-battlefield.html

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Maybe at one time, but no longer. Now it’s the right to express one’s pain and the duty to attend to the Pain Monster the lies within us.

And the oh-so delicate students at many colleges and universities across the country are eager to share their inner pain with all who will listen – and demand to be sheltered from anything that could cause yet more inner turmoil.

In times past, the college student who tells you of his pain for some imagined slight would have been scolded and mocked for his self-indulgent, bruised feelings. If you’re so thin-skinned, grow thicker skin, we’d have told him. Grow up. But we don’t talk like that anymore.

We’ve been sensitized and disciplined and sued when we talk like that. As a result we’ve grown the wobbliest and most spineless generation the country has ever seen. Bear in mind, I’m talking about the adults administrators and professors at America’s colleges, not the students. The students are just taking their cues from us. When they profit from our indulgence they show themselves braver than we are, if more malevolent.

Through our weakness, through our unwillingness to discipline infantilized behavior, we’ve created the Pain Monsters at Yale University, Middlebury College, Evergreen State College and a growing number of other colleges. We’ve signaled that they can behave as outrageously as they want, so long as they justify themselves by uttering the magic words: “I want to talk about my pain.”

There are few colleges and universities that coddle students more than Yale, and few where students are more privileged. Any 18-year-old accepted there should feel a tremendous sense of gratitude. For many, a Yale degree will open doors to prestigious graduate schools, high-paying jobs, and entry into the ranks of our nation’s wealthy and powerful elite.

But students soon learn better than to be grateful for their good fortune after arriving at Yale. Instead they’re taught to express their hatred for anyone in authority, for anyone who deviates in the slightest way from the latest progressive orthodoxies.

When the head of one residential college at Yale asked students to listen to other views, one of them yelled at him: “Why the f--- did you accept the position? Who the f--- hired you? You should step down!” When the college head patiently replied, the student answered: “You should not sleep at night! You are disgusting!” Students later complained that they were so traumatized by the college head that that they were having breakdowns.

Incidentally, until last year the title of heads of residential colleges at Yale was “master.” But that title – taken from the “ancient collegiate tradition” at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England – was dropped because it “carries a painful and unwelcome connotation” to slavery and slave owners “that can be difficult or impossible for some students and residential college staff to ignore,” Yale announced in dropping the title.

At other colleges and universities, protesters told conservative speakers: “You’re killing us.” College Republicans were told: “Your existence is a disturbance.”

We see the same thing in the unhinged Trump Derangement protests. On the anniversary of last year’s election next month, tens of thousands of progressives plan to assemble in Boston Common “to scream helplessly at the sky.” I wouldn’t advise anyone to show up in a Make American Great Again cap.

“I want to talk about my pain,” said a student at a Yale protest. It’s easy enough to deride the silly things student protestors say, but I don’t want to deny that the pain was real. We have an infinite capacity to obsess over perceived slights, to turn them into the deepest psychological wounds, and to turn that into boundless hatred.

The interesting question is not whether the pain is real. Rather, the question is why we’re seeing more of it today than in the past. And the answer is because we’ve incentivized pain. We’ve let people know that pain, even idiotic, senseless pain, can be weaponized and employed against hated opponents, whether college teachers or local conservatives. And when you incentivize something, you get more of it.

The pain is real. But it is also strategic. What comes first is the desire to justify one’s hatred, for which the pain operates as a permission slip. It makes the protestor think his hatred noble, and lets him hug himself in self-delight for reveling in the most evil of emotions.

Colleges and universities are meant to be places of learning and intellectual growth, where old assumptions and ideas are challenged – not pain-free zones where delicate sensibilities are coddled and no one is exposed to disturbing or challenging ideas. That’s a lesson we’ve somehow forgotten.","Beware the incredible 'pain monsters' we've created at Yale, Evergreen State, Middlebury and other schools",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/beware-incredible-pain-monsters-weve-created-at-yale-evergreen-state-middlebury-and-other-schools.html

Time: 3:30 p.m.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida's Jim McElwain and Georgia's Kirby Smart took detailed notes during their time at Alabama.

Organizational structure. Recruiting tactics. Practice techniques. Leadership qualities. Game management.

It was basically How to Build a Successful Program 101.

More Florida Gators news

Or How to Become Alabama 2.0.

One of Nick Saban's former assistants sure seems like he has a better grasp on the subject matter than the other.

McElwain and Smart appear headed in opposite directions as unranked Florida and unbeaten Georgia prepare to play their annual rivalry game Saturday at EverBank Field, a Southeastern Conference matchup better known as ""The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party.""

The Gators (3-3, 3-2 SEC) have lost two in a row, are two-touchdown underdogs and are coming off a bizarre week. McElwain said Monday that Florida players and families received death threats amid the team's struggles. He did not contact police and declined to say whether he personally received threats.

School administrators, including athletic director Scott Stricklin, met with McElwain in hopes of gathering more information and helping alleviate any safety concerns. McElwain rebuffed their efforts, prompting a statement from the athletic department that essentially criticized McElwain for being uncooperative.

McElwain backtracked a bit Wednesday, but stopped short of apologizing and again refused to provide details about the threats.

Couple that strange situation with McElwain's inability to develop a quarterback or improve a woeful offense, and it hardly would be a surprise to learn that the administrators are growing weary of McElwain even though he led the team to consecutive Eastern Division titles.

""I know a lot of people are doubting us right now, so it's up to us to prove everybody wrong,"" Florida linebacker Jeremiah Moon said.

The third-ranked Bulldogs (7-0, 4-0) have way more believers .

Freshman Jake Fromm ranks second in the conference in pass efficiency. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel are one of the best running back tandems in the country. Georgia's offense is averaging 43 points a game in league play, and its defense is fourth nationally in scoring.

Throw in Smart's recent recruiting run, and there's plenty of hope beyond 2017.

""He's got things going,"" McElwain said.

Keeping them going is the challenge. The Gators have won three in a row and 21 of 27 in the series, which has had its share of upsets over the years.

The Bulldogs don't want to be on the losing end again, something Smart made clear during a team meeting Sunday night. Smart asked players to stand up if they had beaten Florida.

""No one stood up,"" Georgia nose tackle John Atkins said. ""The road to win in the East goes through Florida, so you have to be able to beat them. It's a big rivalry. You don't want to lose to a big rival.""

Here are some other things to know about Georgia and Florida:

RETURNING GATORS: Florida expects to have big-play receivers Tyrie Cleveland (ankle) and Kadarius Toney (shoulder) back from injuries along with defensive end Jabari Zuniga (ankle). Receiver Josh Hammond (back) is considered ""very questionable.""

TRAVELING DOGS: Georgia fans have gobbled up tickets for road games this season and even had a noticeable presence at Notre Dame. They had equally impressive turnouts at Tennessee and at Auburn, raising speculation that they could outnumber Florida fans in the neutral-site game. ""Whatever the magic potion has been, it's been good for our players,"" Smart said. ""We certainly hope it continues in Jacksonville.""

TRASH TALK: The Gators made headlines early in the week with choice words for their rivals. Hammond was the most outspoken, saying ""They might be the No. (3) team in the country, but they can't beat Florida."" McElwain responded by saying he ""would hope they're confident."" He also expects Smart to take advantage of the bulletin-board material . ""I'm sure he's got it all up. No doubt.""

RED-ZONE SCORING: The game features two of five Football Bowl Subdivision teams that are perfect in the red zone this season. Georgia is 29 of 29, with 20 touchdowns; Florida is 15 of 15, including 11 touchdowns. ""We've done a decent job once we get down there,"" McElwain said. ""The key is getting down there more often.""

Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller announced the refiling of criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault, after District Justice Allen Sinclair threw out the felony charges in September against eight Beta Thea Pi fraternity members, a press release stated.

The judge let stand lesser charges against them and six others. He dismissed other charges altogether against four of the members of the fraternity.

Security video of the incident recorded Piazza appearing intoxicated and being led to a couch after 11 p.m. A few minutes later, he fell head-first down a set of basement stairs and had to be carried back up in an unconscious state.

For several hours, members of the fraternity appeared to take half-hearted and even counterproductive measures to tend to their injured friend, pouring liquid on him and strapping on a loaded backpack to prevent him from rolling over and choking on vomit. He died two days later on Feb. 4 at a local hospital.

Tom Kline, the attorney for the Piazza family, applauded Parks Miller’s decision to refile charges.

""The Piazza family is both pleased and supportive of the refiling of the charges in their quest for complete justice in this tragedy,"" Kline said.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

We all know they are only interested in Russian collusion if they can pin it on President Trump.","For more than a year, Democrats and their pals in the abusively biased press have been breathlessly talking about Russia-Trump collusion as if it were the worst scandal in American history.

After a year, the best they can do is somberly insist there is smoke, but no fire. The truth is, there is no smoke. Trump collusion with Russia has been a big lie.

Not that there wasn’t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It’s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal.

An FBI informant in this case who infiltrated this Putin network right here in America is offering evidence. He has emails, personal recordings and documents. He has insider knowledge that America's national security was compromised at the highest level. Our country was sold out, right in front of our faces. Clinton and Obama let it happen.

We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.

You might think that the media, which has hungered for evidence of a Russia scandal for over a year might be excited to finally have real evidence of not just one, but two cases of Russian collusion. Yet, they are giving next to zero coverage to this story.

We all know they are only interested in Russian collusion if they can pin it on President Trump. That should mean proving that he was somehow involved in the WikiLeaks release of Democratic Party big shot John Podesta’s emails. But then, there is one man Special Counsel Robert Mueller or anyone in the media could talk to who could tell them where those emails came from: Julian Assange.

Assange knows where he got those emails and whether it had anything to do with Russia or Donald Trump. I've talked to him now on air five times. But no one else has, because he has been clear: He did not get the emails from Russia. Sorry Democrats. Sorry propaganda media.

These scandals, lies and cover-ups are brought to you by a mainstream media blinded by its hatred of President Trump and contempt for the truth and the American people. We have been regularly lied to. We have been misinformed. We have been propagandized by a political party and abusively biased liberal media that have literally no interest in helping the people in this country or telling the truth.

To them, everything obviously is about politics and about advancing their rigid, radical left-wing ideology.
