Other studies have found a higher rate of heart failure among obese individuals, said Dr. Carl Lavie, the medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans. But when it comes to coronary heart disease outcomes, studies that take both weight and physical fitness into account have concluded that “fitness is more important than fatness,” at least for the moderately obese, he said.

“For the very large number of people who are overweight or mildly obese, I don’t think it’s doomsday if they can keep themselves out of the low fitness level,” Dr. Lavie said.

Dr. Caleyachetty, the author of the new paper, agreed that the lack of information about fitness and exercise was “an important caveat.”

“Those people who are metabolically healthy, obese and vigorously active may have a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease,” he conceded.

Critics say that’s an important message to convey, because many people will find it easier to embark on an exercise regimen and stick with it than to lose weight and maintain the weight loss.

“I do think that’s a better message than telling people, ‘You better not gain weight,’” Dr. Lavie said. “People aren’t trying to gain weight. They’re not trying to get to be obese. A better message would be to tell people that if they get themselves to be more physically active, they can improve their prognosis, despite carrying a few extra pounds. That’s a better message, and a more obtainable message.”

But Jennifer W. Bea, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona Cancer Center who was a co-author of an editorial accompanying the new study, said, “we haven’t heard the whole story yet” and questioned whether someone can be obese but “metabolically healthy.”

“Obesity itself is a metabolic disorder,” Dr. Bea said, noting that being overweight and obese is often associated with low-grade inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease, regardless of metabolic measures.

That doesn’t mean that weight trumps all. Indeed, the study found that individuals who were considered to be of normal weight but who had a single risk factor such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol were actually at greater risk for coronary heart disease than the healthy obese people.

“The messaging is always, ‘lose weight no matter what,’” said Patrick Bradshaw, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. “But when you’re at normal weight, you’re not given a lot of lifestyle guidance. Your doctor may say ‘exercise and eat right,’ but if you have these metabolic abnormalities you’re at higher risk of disease, and you may need more intensive lifestyle modifications — not to lose weight, but to improve health.”

One of the messages of this new paper “is that metabolic health is important regardless of your weight,” Dr. Bradshaw said.

That goes for people who are considered underweight as well. The new study found, for example, that underweight individuals with no metabolic problems were at higher risk for stroke than normal weight, overweight or obese people with no metabolic problems, and if underweight people had metabolic issues, their risk increased even further.

Interestingly, while the risks of being overweight and obese draw scrutiny, doctors are often at a loss to explain the risks of being too thin.",‘Fat but Fit’? The Controversy Continues,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/well/eat/fat-but-fit-the-controversy-continues.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human “trolls” and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.

Now the Silicon Valley companies — long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington — face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance. Twitter’s general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.

Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform. Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads’ sponsors.

But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter’s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.

Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities’ use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company’s decision on Thursday — but cautioned that it would not be enough.

“I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter’s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. “What I hope is we’ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.”

Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.

“Twitter’s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets — RT and Sputnik — from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute” for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.

Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability. In September, the company’s vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RT’s three principal Twitter accounts. In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.

On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.

Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter’s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human “trolls” on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.

“I think it’s only a drop in the bucket,” said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “What’s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik’s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn’t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.”

Moreover, Twitter’s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter — and rival social media companies — treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.

A Twitter spokeswoman said the company’s decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.

“This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. “It’s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.”",Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia-today-sputnik.html

ITT Technical Institute in Florida gave students the impression they’d be having careers along the line of “C.S.I.: Miami.” Actually, they frequently wound up working as security guards, degree in hand and $50,000 in debt.

There are so many awful for-profit school stories. There was that one in New York that sold students a $35,000 “Gold Elite Package” and had to change its name to “Entrepreneur Initiative” after the state determined it had no right to call itself a university. …

“The outcomes for people who take out loans at for-profits are abysmal,” said Ben Miller of the Center for American Progress. He added that almost all the students borrow, for courses they could sometimes get for one sixth the price at a community college. And about half the people who borrow default.

As the stories about deceitful for-profits mounted, the Obama administration came up with regulations making it easier for students to refuse to pay their loans if a school had misrepresented their chances of graduating and getting a lucrative career. The rules were supposed to go into effect in July, but DeVos has delayed their implementation.

Insiders call those regulations “borrower defense to repayment.” However, if you prefer, you could also refer to them as “something that reminds us of a certain school that used to promise its students fabulous careers in the real estate industry. …”

O.K., we’re talking here about Trump University. I knew I couldn’t fool you forever. Cynics might wonder if DeVos has been going to the defense of for-profit colleges so quickly because she wants to please her boss. Who might not enjoy seeing a lot of headlines about greedy colleges that make promises they never intended to keep, being brought down by the forces of justice.

But let’s be positive. Perhaps we could be grateful that DeVos is giving us opportunities to bring up Trump University on a regular basis. As a sort of cautionary tale.

For instance, the Department of Education has stopped approving new fraud claims against for-profits, leaving a backlog of more than 87,000. Every time the number goes up, we could say, “This is even more than the number of students who complained about their loans for Trump University.”

If DeVos says what the country needs now is less regulation, we can recall that Trump University had instructors allegedly handpicked by Donald Trump himself, although it turned out that he’d never even met them.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

In this crowded mix, a dark horse has appeared: the former Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson. He was driven from office in April 2016 when he became the first major casualty of the leaked Panama Papers. They revealed that he and his wife had set up a company in the British Virgin Islands.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson had come to power on promises to clear out corruption. But the Panama Papers leak, though it revealed nothing illegal, suggested an unseemly conflict of interest, and an outraged public called for his ouster.

For days, Icelanders gathered outside Parliament and hurled fish and yogurt in protest. He eventually stepped down, prompting snap elections. It seemed as if he would never lead his country again.

But Mr. Gunnlaugsson is back. He ditched his old party, the Progressives, and formed the Center Party, a populist outfit promising to squeeze the financial sector and redistribute the wealth.

He has campaigned under the banner of an Icelandic horse, gaining surprising momentum. His charisma, his threats to take news media outlets to court for supposed unfair treatment and his promises to wrest wealth from Iceland’s banks have resonated in his largely rural base.

“He has talked his way out of the scandal,” said Johannes Kr. Kristjansson, the Reykjavik Media editor who revealed Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s family ties to the Panama Papers. “You can compare him to Donald Trump. He has a group of people who will elect him no matter what he says or does.”

In one fiery debate, Mr. Gunnlaugsson stormed offstage, refusing to shake his rivals’ hands. As prime minister, he showed an eccentric flair, inviting counterparts to play with Legos and once meeting Barack Obama in one polished shoe and one sneaker.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson declined multiple requests for an interview, but he has been adamant that he did no wrong. In fact, he claims he is a victim of a conspiracy initiated by Iceland’s political and financial establishment in cahoots with the financier George Soros.

An outright victory for Mr. Gunnlaugsson remains unlikely. He’s hoping his party does well enough to become part of the governing coalition, political observers say. But he’s no kingmaker.

Some experts say it will take a rickety coalition of as many as four parties to form a new government. If the Left Greens win, Mr. Gunnlaugsson would be an unlikely coalition partner. They appear to be more open to teaming with a revived Social Democrat Party and, potentially, the Pirate Party — a nerdy group of futurists, hackers, anarchists and poets.

The anti-establishment Pirates capitalized on the anger over corruption and Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s ouster to take second place in snap general elections last October. But they also drove his successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, to quit as prime minister after his center-right Progressive Party’s share of Parliament shrunk to eight seats from 19.

Among the notable parties in the current race is Bright Future, known as a group of idealistic hipsters who say they shun the idea of becoming career politicians. The party is on course to lose most, if not all, of its seats, polls suggest, after helping to precipitate one of the pivotal twists in Icelandic politics.

The vote, the second snap election in a year, turns on an episode involving Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson. Mr. Benediktsson’s father had written a letter of reference for a friend seeking a form of civil pardon after being sentenced in 2004 to prison on charges of raping his stepdaughter for over 12 years.

The Justice Ministry covered up the letter, critics say, but the secret found its way to the news media. It was the final straw for one of the coalition partners, Bright Future, which peeled away and brought down the government.

In September, eight months after Mr. Benediktsson’s administration came to power, he called for new elections, lamenting, “We have lost the majority.”

But another scandal landed just as the campaign got underway, salting the nation’s old financial wounds. Journalists released some of Mr. Benediktsson’s personal financial records from the days before the banking collapse.

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

Photo

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at New York’s Leica Gallery. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Did the smog smother the murders or did the murders obscure the smog? That’s the terrible question Kate Winkler Dawson raises in DEATH IN THE AIR: The True Story of a Serial Killer, the Great London Smog, and the Strangling of a City (Hachette, $27), her deeply researched and densely atmospheric study of two intersecting events in London, the murder spree of John Reginald (Reg) Christie and the Great Smog of 1952.

It was bitter cold that December, prompting the city’s eight million residents to pile on the coal briquettes and draw close to the fire. At the time, Britain was selling its best black coal to foreign countries and palming off the dirty brown stuff on its own people, who couldn’t afford the better coal anyway. But this cheaper means of heating proved deadly, asphyxiating 4,000 Londoners and leaving thousands more gasping. The death toll was so high that undertakers ran out of coffins. Shifting weather patterns contributed to the disaster, trapping pollutants over the city, grounding planes and suspending traffic. Theaters, hotels and restaurants operated on reduced staff when workers were unable to report; in any case, few of their patrons were willing or able to venture out. Day after day, the “peasouper” hung in the air and the roaring fires burned in the city’s hearths. “Swirls of fog,” Dawson explains, “were romantic and beguiling to Londoners.” And the “affinity for an open fire was virtually a requirement for being British.”

Meanwhile, the fog rolling over 10 Rillington Place proved a satanic blessing, smothering the little garden where Reg Christie was industriously planting the bodies of the eight women he’d killed. (Ironically, he’d enticed some of them into his flat with the promise of a special cough medicine that would clear their smog-filled lungs.) This diligent gardener wasn’t entirely secretive about what he was up to, even using a human thighbone to prop up the garden fence. “ ‘Neighbors watched me digging,’ he said. ‘They nodded ‘cheerios’ to me.’ ” Until he was brought to trial the following year, the infamous “Beast of Rillington Place” may have been the only person in London to delight in the Great Fog.

Any book with “Belle Époque” in the title puts me in mind of Woody Allen’s enchanting fantasy film, “Midnight in Paris,” in which Pablo Picasso’s mistress and her present-day American lover travel back in time to the glorious era when Paris was the playground of great artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas. John Merriman’s BALLAD OF THE ANARCHIST BANDITS: The Crime Spree That Gripped Belle Époque Paris (Nation Books, $28) tells another story of that era — not the romance of the “Ville Lumière” with its dazzling palaces and grand hotels but the dark tale of a city in the grip of a crime wave. “The guidebooks never mentioned the quartiers populaires,” Merriman notes, “or the impoverished suburbs of Paris, where most of the workers who ran the trams, built the popular new cars and cleaned the city lived.” It took the anarchists to argue, often violently, that working people were suffering from “increased mechanization, the decline of apprenticeship, the increase in piece rates, speedups and the beginnings of scientific management in large factories.”

Photo

Merriman’s subject is the rise and fall of the Bonnot Gang, but he shrewdly wraps his historical analysis in the arms of a love story. Rirette Maîtrejean and Victor Kibaltchiche met on the battlements of the class war, which fueled their affair and gave it purpose. But Jules Bonnot, the leader of their gang, was more committed to plunder than to the cause. “Our blood pays for the luxury of the wealthy” went the anarchist battle cry. “Our enemy is the master. Long live anarchy!” Yet Bonnot just wanted to get his hands on that upper-class loot.

Some true-crime books aren’t the least bit romantic, and they’re usually the ones that break your heart. Dashka Slater wrote THE 57 BUS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.99) for teenagers, but her audience should also include parents. The two youngsters from Oakland, Calif., whose paths cross so disastrously are both extremely likable. Sasha, a boy who attends a small private school and “identifies as agender,” is on the bus going home when Richard, a junior at the public high school who’s goofing off, puts a lighter to the gauzy skirt Sasha’s wearing. The skirt goes up in flames, Sasha receives second- and third-degree burns, and Richard is accused of two hate-crime felonies. Charged as an adult, he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.

Slater, who wrote a shorter account of this story that ran in The New York Times Magazine, views these bare facts from a firm sociological perspective. Sasha comes from a nice neighborhood up in the hills. Richard lives in the flatlands of East Oakland, where two-thirds of the city’s murders occur. “The schools are shabbier here; the test scores are lower. There’s more trash on the streets, more roaming dogs, more liquor stores, fewer grocery stores.” Slater doesn’t apologize for Richard; she just asks us to consider where he came from and to question the ingrained prejudice of a legal system that eventually locked him up for five years. Even Sasha’s father recognized that what Richard did was “impulsive, immature and unpremeditated.”

Michael Arntfield makes the most of the local crimes he covers in MAD CITY: The True Story of the Campus Murders That America Forgot (Little A, $24.95) by hitching them to some of Wisconsin’s more flamboyant murder cases. Regional pride was excuse enough to bring up notables like the “Plainfield Ghoul,” Ed Gein (“a serial killer and body snatcher whose crimes inspired the Robert Bloch novel and subsequent Alfred Hitchcock film, ‘Psycho,’ as well as the comparatively down-market ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ franchise that followed”), and the “Milwaukee Cannibal” Jeffrey Dahmer. Not to mention the “Vampire of Düsseldorf,” an infamous German murderer whose mummified head came ashore in the baggage of a returning World War II soldier. (It continues to be the prize attraction in a little museum in the tourist town of Wisconsin Dells.)

Arntfield presents his murder case as “perhaps the greatest story never told in American history, at least the history of American crime.” Like his literary style, that claim is overblown. But the story of Christine Rothschild and Linda Tomaszewski still deserves to be told. In 1967, the girls met and became friends at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The late ’60s were a time when protest marches were replacing pep rallies and coeds no longer wanted to be called coeds. Christine had a room on the ground floor of Ann Emery Hall, a genteel women’s residence with “no controlled entry, no intercom, no cameras or convex mirrors, and no sign-in book.” She was unaware that a stalker was paying her nightly visits (by way of her window) until he stepped up his twisted courtship with creepy phone calls.

Once she’d identified her stalker as 42-year-old Niels Bjorn Jorgensen, a third-year medical school resident, Christine told the campus police, whose advice was simply to stay alert and buy a rape whistle. Luckily, she’d also confided in Linda. Christine wound up beaten and stabbed to death, and her friend was the only person with the grit to pursue Jorgensen — across the country, for 40 years! As a grim reminder of what he’d done, for many of those years Linda also sent him a card on Valentine’s Day.

You need not be a media historian to notice that we live in a golden age of press harassment, domestic propaganda and coercive efforts to control political debate. The Trump White House repeatedly seeks to discredit the press, threatens to strip broadcasters of their licenses and calls for the firing of journalists and football players for speaking their minds. A foreign government tries to hack our elections, and journalists and public speakers are regularly attacked by vicious, online troll armies whose aim is to silence opponents.

In this age of “new” censorship and blunt manipulation of political speech, where is the First Amendment? Americans like to think of it as the great protector of the press and of public debate. Yet it seems to have become a bit player, confined to a narrow and often irrelevant role. It is time to ask: Is the First Amendment obsolete? If so, what can be done?

These questions arise because the jurisprudence of the First Amendment was written for a different set of problems in a very different world. The First Amendment was ignored for much of American history, coming to life only in the 1920s thanks to the courage of judges like Learned Hand, Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Courts and civil libertarians used the amendment to protect speakers from government prosecution and censorship as it was practiced in the 20th century, such as the arrest of pamphleteers and the seizure of anarchist newspapers by the Postal Service.

But in the 21st century, censorship works differently, as the writer and academic Zeynep Tufekci has illustrated. The complete suppression of dissenting speech isn’t feasible in our “cheap speech” era. Instead, the world’s most sophisticated censors, including Russia and China, have spent a decade pioneering tools and techniques that are better suited to the internet age. Unfortunately, those new censorship tools have become unwelcome imports in the United States, with catastrophic results for our democracy.

The Russian government was among the first to recognize that speech itself could be used as a tool of suppression and control. The agents of its “web brigade,” often called the “troll army,” disseminate pro-government news, generate false stories and coordinate swarm attacks on critics of the government. The Chinese government has perfected “reverse censorship,” whereby disfavored speech is drowned out by “floods” of distraction or pro-government sentiment.

During the game, Dad knelt on the field 20 feet from home plate and all the heroes who stepped up to it: Williams, DiMaggio, Lou Boudreau. It was important that he not call attention to himself, but once when he didn’t hustle enough to grab a bat, he heard from Yogi Berra, who had just come up to the majors. “Hey kid,” he said, “next time, be sure you get that bat out of there a bit more quickly.”

One of the White Sox’ big hitters, Pat Seerey, thought of my dad as something of a good-luck charm. Before games, while the other players warmed up with each other, Seerey threw the ball back and forth with him. Each time, Seerey would take a step back. By the end Dad could barely get it back to him. “I don’t think I ever threw it away, though.”

My dad was there, in Philadelphia, when Seerey hit four home runs in a single game, joining an exclusive club. My dad is in the newspaper photo, standing at home plate, waiting for Seerey to come in. He wanted to be there to shake his friend’s hand.

Razzing from the dugout was a sport unto itself, and the part my dad probably enjoyed the most, as any 14-year-old boy would. Recalling the players’ shenanigans decades later makes him break into a full laugh. He remembers that every time the short and squat Berra was at bat, one of the Sox pitchers would imitate a monkey, looping his arm over the top of the dugout, scratching himself and ooh-ooh eee-eeeing. Williams once told a reporter that he’d rather be a fireman. So every time he was at bat, one of the Sox would walk back into the dugout tunnel, which served as a megaphone, and make loud siren noises.

DiMaggio, though, was in his own class. He commanded more respect. Whenever he was up, all the players fell silent.

After the games the players would take off their shoes and throw them in a heap. It was dad’s job to polish them up and put them back in the lockers. In those days, the uniforms were wool, and after a game they’d be wet with sweat. There was a huge oven in the clubhouse with a clothesline running through it. Dad would throw the uniforms over the line and dry them out in the oven so they could be worn the next day. After a two- or three-game series, they would be washed. Dad would usually get a ride home from one of the players or sportswriters. He was paid $1 a game. No tips.

Sometimes he had to run errands for the clubhouse manager and get something from the opposing team’s clubhouse. That was my dad’s chance to approach the visiting players — DiMaggio, Williams, Bob Feller — all of whom signed the balls my dad held out for them.

Across the front of one of my dad’s baseballs is neat cursive looping into the name Satchel Paige. It was Paige’s first year in the majors. The Negro Leagues star was one of the first African-Americans to join the American League. The White Sox were still all white.

They were also dead last in the league and usually drew small crowds. But the first night the Indians came to Comiskey Park after signing Paige was different. The entire stadium was full. Thousands were turned away. Dad doesn’t remember any racial taunting, just that so many black Chicagoans had come to see their hero, the 42-year-old rookie. “Satchel pitched a great game too,” he said, a five-hit shutout. (Before the integration of the game, Comiskey was usually where the big event of the Negro Leagues season, the East-West All-Star Game, was played.) The Sox finished the season 46 games behind the Indians, who went on to win the World Series, the last time they did so.

The Satchel Paige ball is worth the most. Dad may get a couple thousand for it. There is one he’s holding onto, though. It’s the ball that all the White Sox signed.

Like some other Russian experts, Stephen Blank, a senior fellow with the nonprofit American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, said they indicate that Ms. Veselnitskaya’s actions “were coordinated from the very top.”

The Trump Tower meeting is of keen interest to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a widespread fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to the Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family, to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last Friday, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of Russian analysts called it inconceivable Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

These situations tend to happen in neighborhoods undergoing rapid gentrification where the rents are rising fast and landlords see a way to squeeze more money out of a space.

In 2016, the city’s Department of Buildings received 18,844 complaints about potentially illegal conversions in the city. If an inspector finds tenants living in an illegal apartment in dangerous conditions, for example, if the apartment does not have adequate fire safety measures, a vacate order could force tenants out. However, in most cases, an inspector will issue the building owner a violation with a court summons, ordering the owner to correct the problem. Tenants living in such apartments may be able to withhold rent.

Over the past year, William J. Gribben, a tenant lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan law firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue and Joseph, has noticed a spike in calls to his office from tenants complaining about illegal apartments. Most of the calls come from tenants who have rented out a single bedroom in a larger apartment.

With strangers living together, bedroom doors often have deadbolt locks, a violation of city occupancy and fire rules. The arrangement may also create a de facto single room occupancy hotel, which would likely violate the city housing maintenance code. “It’s dangerous for tenants,” Mr. Gribben said of a phenomenon that he said “has snowballed.”

Some apartments, like the one where I lived, raise red flags from the moment you step inside. But other illegal arrangements are harder to spot. Paint the walls, add a kitchen and a bathroom to the fourth floor of a three-family townhouse, and who would ever know that the certificate of occupancy limits the number of legal apartments to three, not four?

That’s what happened to Mr. Hassan, a marketing manager who moved to New York from Denver in May 2016. He found the Bedford-Stuyvesant studio listed on Craigslist for $1,350 a month. Located on the top floor of a brownstone, the apartment looked ordinary. “When I signed the lease, there was nothing in there that said, ‘This is not a rentable unit,’” said Mr. Hassan, 51.

But in July 2017, the city’s Department of Buildings posted a notice at the entrance to the building alerting tenants to a complaint about an illegal unit. Mr. Hassan was baffled. His apartment had polished wood floors, full-size windows and a renovated bathroom. The kitchen, however, lacked a stove, a detail that might have given another renter pause. But Mr. Hassan’s apartment in Denver did not have a stove either, so he did not find the setup unusual.

Mr. Hassan’s landlord, Kwabena Charles, explained to Mr. Hassan that the building’s certificate of occupancy only permitted three rentable units. In order to pass a buildings department inspection, Mr. Hassan would have to pack up his possessions and remove his name from the door to the building. Mr. Hassan doubted the plausibility of the scheme. Even without clothes, books and photographs, “The moment you walk in, you know this is a habitable unit,” Mr. Hassan said.

Mr. Hassan also worried about what would happen if he erased all evidence of his residency. Without a lease or his name on the door, how could he prove that he lived in the apartment if, say, he came home to find his belongings missing?

Illegal apartments “hurt the tenants who get involved,” Mr. Gribben said.

In a rambling conversation that Mr. Hassan recorded and later shared with me, Mr. Charles blamed Mr. Hassan for creating a fire hazard because he kept too many possessions in his apartment. He also said that if a fire were to start in Mr. Hassan’s apartment, “the whole building goes up in flames, everybody dies.”

Yet Mr. Charles did not want Mr. Hassan to vacate the space. Instead, he told him to purge his belongings and help mislead the inspectors. “How to get rid of an inspector is to overdo it or to dumb it down so they’re not smart enough” to realize that anyone lives in the space, Mr. Charles explained on the tape. “I could do anything. This could be my clubhouse,” he said of the fourth-floor space.

But after inspectors visited the building twice but failed to get into the apartment, the Department of Buildings closed the investigation. The buildings department typically closes investigations after two unsuccessful inspection attempts. A new complaint would trigger a new investigation.

In late September, Mr. Hassan left and moved into a two-month sublet elsewhere in Brooklyn. “Things were not improving,” Mr. Hassan said. “I just wanted to get away.”

In early October, the apartment was listed for $1,500 a month on Craigslist as a “charming studio.” Mr. Charles said to me, “I haven’t violated anything.” He explained that even though the building is zoned as a three-family home, he could rent out the fourth unit because it had a hot plate instead of a stove. Without a complete kitchen, “there’s nothing wrong with it.” But according to the city buildings department, the fourth floor attic of a three-family home must remain unoccupied, even without a stove.

By mid-October, the listing had been removed from Craigslist. Mr. Charles declined to say whether the apartment had been rented — or if a new tenant knew that the space might be illegal.",Could You Be Living in an Illegal Apartment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/could-you-be-living-in-an-illegal-apartment.html

(Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)

Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work. I even liked how I had written it.

But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros’ left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career. It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.

While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-racking.

So, goodbye Corey Seager story. I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.

Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs. As a reporter, I have no rooting interest. But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.

I reframed the story around the Houston’s improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.

“Don’t worry if it’s sloppy, we’ll clean up whatever,” said Petterson, who has saved me on deadline before.

Within 10 minutes of his email, the Dodgers tied the game at 5-5 with a home run by Yasiel Puig and a single by Enrique Hernandez. I wrote back to Petterson: “I’ve added like 50 white hairs the past three innings alone.” I had not gotten up from my seat since the fifth inning.

By now, I knew that I needed to come up with a way to capture the mayhem of the game, no matter the outcome. I wrote a broad introduction — or lede, as we call them in journalism — and worked backward through the wildest moments of the game. (The teams set a new World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings alone.) I left a few sentences with blanks, knowing I would fill in the final details — the time of the game, the last out, the winning hit.

Gregory Porter, ‘Nature Boy’

Gregory Porter’s new album “Nat King Cole and Me” pays tribute to one of his strongest influences. With its hearth-like comforts and flawless elocution, Cole’s voice is almost quintessentially dated. But Mr. Porter manages to embody some of the same principles — poise, savvy, listener validation — while punching it up with some contemporary solemnity and world-weariness. On “Nature Boy,” Cole’s signature song, the swarming and enchanting string arrangements of Vince Mendoza echo those on the original 1948 recording, though they’re more abundant. After a climactic interlude, Mr. Porter repeats the song’s famous catch phrase one last time, his voice now measured and low: “The greatest thing you’ll ever learn/Is just to love and be loved in return.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Brian Eno and Kevin Shields, ‘Only Once Away My Son’

How did this team-up take so long to happen? Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and the producer-songwriter-conceptualist Brian Eno both cherish the resonant, the amorphous, the unmoored, the immersive, the destabilizing. “Only Once Away My Son,” an instrumental, has a deceptive opening, with an urgent drum-and-cymbal beat that soon evaporates. The rest blends tinkly bell tones and almost subliminally soothing low notes with what must be Mr. Shields’s swaths of hovering tremolo guitar: freneticism that begins on a far horizon, draws close and lingers, menacingly, before finding what sounds more like respite than resolution. JON PARELES

Clean Bandit Featuring Julia Michaels, ‘I Miss You’

Sometimes Julia Michaels sings like she’s choking on the words, as if she’s turning away from them as soon as they escape from her mouth. On “I Miss You,” an affecting collaboration with the austere British dance-pop outfit Clean Bandit, she’s at her most forlorn: “You weren’t a fan of pictures, so I hardly ever took ‘em/Got ‘em saved in my mind from the bedroom/So that way I can’t forget your skin.” JON CARAMANICA

Rhye, ‘Taste’

The elusive R&B group Rhye , led by the singer Milosh, reappears with the insinuating “Taste,” a bedroom whisper — “I’m not awake, I’m not alone” — delivered in a perfectly androgynous falsetto. It’s got a subdued funk pulse hinting at Sly and the Family Stone’s “Family Affair,” interlaced with burbling chamber-pop woodwinds; it never gets anywhere near too pushy. J.P.

The Weather Station, ‘You and I (on the Other Side of the World)’

Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian songwriter who leads the Weather Station, sings as if she’s spent a lot of time pondering her way toward complicated conclusions. “You and I (on the Other Side of the World)” is a folk-rock meditation exploring the mysteries of an enduring marriage: “More intimate than I could imagine/But with space I cannot fathom.” The music harks back to the late 1960s, mostly clinging to two chords as string arrangements rise and subside in the background, mirroring hopes and uncertainties. J.P.

Snoh Aalegra Featuring Logic, ‘Sometimes’

The slow-and-low hip-hop-soul saunter of 1995-97 finds new life in “Sometimes,” one of the standout songs from the impressive new Snoh Aalegra album “FEELS.” On this song, she floats somewhere between neo-soul — its original incarnation — and trip-hop, singing breathily and with purpose. A slickly sneering verse from Logic adds acid and bite. J.C.

Sleigh Bells, ‘And Saints’

So long, power chords. “And Saints,” from a coming EP titled “Kid Kruschev,” sets aside Sleigh Bells’ usual drums-and-guitar bravado for a different minimal configuration: just motoric bass notes and high, filmy synthesizer tones enfolding Alexis Krauss’s distraught voice and elusive tidings: “Temple throb, dust lakes/Black gold, tigers and saints.” Whatever she's going through is more than a headache. J.P.

Kap G Featuring Lil Baby, ‘Pull Up’

Kap G is one of hip-hop’s underrated melodists. He sing-raps with a slur, leaving his vocals round and a little fuzzy. “Pull Up” plays to his strengths — he sounds woozy, sweet, a little distant, easing between tight clusters of words and dreamy smeared syllables. Behind him, the beat — produced by Young TT & Squat Beats — tinkles and creeps while Kap G elegantly swerves. J.C.

John McNeil and Mike Fahie, ‘Can Do’

Here’s an item on the list of “things we don’t see a lot of anymore” in jazz: a close rapport between two musicians, forged on the jam session stage, week after week over a series of years. But that’s what John McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mike Fahie, a trombonist, have developed. They spent roughly a decade leading sessions at watering holes around New York, mentoring younger musicians and deepening a repertoire. Still, for their debut album together, “Plainsong,” they’ve put the focus on their original compositions, not standard fare. The tunes are harmonically snaked and rhythmically relentless; they highlight the horn players’ teasing interplay, and keep the stellar rhythm section — the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Billy Hart — on the move. Mr. McNeil and Mr. Fahie wrote the uptempo “Can Do” together, and it’s a highlight. G.R.

The card reader does not know which card to read, the card from the transit agency or the credit or debit card, and it could charge a payment to the wrong card. Transport for London’s website says a passenger who falls victim to “card clash” could be charged two maximum fares — on the way in and again on the way out.

Officials say that should not happen in New York with the new system, which will be installed starting late next year. When the fare-reading devices for New York pick up more than one credit card signal, a screen will display a message telling the passenger to choose one. Depending on how often it happens, it could replace “Please swipe again” in the commuter lexicon of dread.

The transportation authority in New York will sell an as-yet unnamed card of its own for riders who choose not to use a smartphone or credit card. New York will also have another feature that London’s system uses: payment with a smartphone app, which security specialists say carries fewer security risks.

“I would worry more about turnstile jumping,” said Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who divides his time between Minneapolis and Cambridge, Mass. “If I have a phone in my hand anyway, I’d rather wave it at a reader than fish in my wallet for something else.”

He also said that New York would benefit by piggybacking on others’ experience. In other words, by not being the first to adopt the technology. “It feels like the system has been shaken out in a bunch of cities,” Mr. Schneier said, “and it feels much more convenient.”

Other data experts echoed the idea that modernizing New York’s fare-payment system involved balancing the risk of a catastrophic breach and the disclosure of passengers’ credit card information against moving millions of people around the city.

“Our infrastructure’s creaky,” said Mike Flowers, who oversaw data analytics for the Bloomberg administration from 2009 to 2013, and is now an executive at a data-technology company. “They’ve got to do something. If enabling far greater communication between rider and ride provider is part of the grease to the cogs of that currently creaky system, I think it’s a great idea and should move forward.”

He said the transit agency did need to be “mindful of the responsibility of getting that deeper reach into people’s day-to-day activity.”

Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the transit agency, called safety the “No. 1 priority, whether it’s transporting our riders or protecting their personal information,” adding that the agency and the companies it hired would safeguard passengers’ information “with the most stringent security standards and protocols.”

The company behind the new New York payment network, Cubic Transportation Systems — also the company behind the MetroCard — says its equipment processes $18 billion for transit operators around the world every year and has built layers of defense to minimize the risks. Its system encrypts data and transmits personal data like credit card numbers using a “token,” not the old-fashioned currency of the subway but a unique digital code generated by the system.

The president of Cubic, Matt Cole, said that the original Oyster Card in London, introduced in 2002, was cracked by researchers in Holland who set out to show it could be done. But in London, “there were zero applications” by hackers. He said that the company put in safeguards that would have called attention to anyone trying to use a fake card.

Transport for London, which operates the transit system, later switched to a more modern system “that has not had any vulnerabilities,” Mr. Cole said, but New York will get an even newer system based on banking industry standards. That, too, has been introduced in London, and, he said, there have not been hacking incidents there.

Still, Cubic is not immune to the perils of the information age. Last November, Cubic’s system in San Francisco was hobbled by a virus that affected 900 office computers at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The virus sent a message threatening to dump data stolen from the agency unless a ransom of about $73,000 in Bitcoin was paid.

Mr. Cole of Cubic said the company’s system was disconnected from the transit agency’s computers “out of an abundance of caution” to be certain the ransomware did not spread. The transit agency, which said it never considered making the ransom payment, reported that its network was not breached. That left open the possibility that the malware was activated through a link in an email.

Cubic expects more passengers in New York to wave smartphones more often than credit or debit cards. On the London Underground, contactless trips made with smartphones or with credit or debit cards now account for about 25 percent of the fares. At about 80 stations, including the one at Gatwick Airport, contactless payments outnumber Oyster Cards.

Data experts say that smartphones are less vulnerable to what Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, called “near-field mischief,” which involves credit or debit cards enabled for near-field communication, a technology that is more common in Europe than in this country.

“It’s like skimming,” she explained. The thieves are “looking to add money to their own cards. Stealing people’s identities is not the goal. There are easier ways of doing that.”

But “near-field mischief” remains a concern, as became apparent when she flew to Hong Kong recently for a conference of data experts. She said one of the experts who gave a presentation handed out Octopus cards, Hong Kong’s version of Oyster cards, along with protective sleeves that prevent thieves from siphoning money off the fare cards.","New Fare System Raises Security Concerns, but Officials Promise Safety",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/new-fare-system-metrocard-security-hacking.html

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

3. As someone living in Arizona, I would suggest that the rest of the nation needs to realize how worrisome, even frightening, Senator Jeff Flake’s decision is. Flake, with Christian (specifically, Mormon) ideals, is giving up his fight for conservative ideals because the behavior he’s seeing on ‘his side’ is contrary to his Christian principles, to common decency.

Horrifying that the atmosphere in our nation has gotten so bad that even a conservative politician whose party is in power is leaving for this reason. I never liked Flake’s politics, much as I didn’t like John McCain’s politics much of the time, but both men are being entirely sincere in their recent statements and perspectives.

8. I was six and at school when J.F.K. was assassinated. I spent the bulk of my life believing that there probably was a conspiracy. Matters like Lee Harvey Oswald being assassinated in public view by a man with loose mob ties certainly raised suspicions. Over the years many misconceptions have been cleared up, many of those misconceptions put forth by Oliver Stone.

Modern, data-driven testing and continued research of many aspects of the event have pointed to one reasonable conclusion: Oswald acted alone. Probably the only cover-ups were to protect the Secret Service, which absolutely blew it. No plot — just sloppy incompetence, sloppy enough that a deranged man could just sit in the window where he worked and assassinate a president.

Many vines have been planted in loamy, fertile soils that were better for table fruits than for nuanced wines. As a result, perhaps, Crozes-Hermitage became known both for easygoing, modestly interesting wines as well as for bottles in which flashy expressions of the winemaker’s hand, like flavors of new oak, were more evident than characteristics of the place.

But the wines we drank were far more interesting than what was once commonplace. As always, I suggested three examples, to be consumed with food and company in a relaxed setting. The three Crozes-Hermitages were: Equinoxe Equis 2015; Alain Graillot 2015; and J.L. Chave Sélection Silène 2015.

The Equinoxe — made by Maxime Graillot, the son of Alain Graillot — was a joy to drink. Ripe, fruity and savory, with flavors of black olives, pepper and roasted meats, it showed many of the characteristics I love about syrah wines from the northern Rhône. But that was about the extent of it.

I would categorize it as a wine that expresses the characteristics of the grape more than the place itself. Its character helps to locate it within that general region, but it lacked the nuances that might have allowed an experienced Rhône drinker to pin it down to a more particular place.

This is an observation more than a criticism. As I said, I found the wine to be delicious, a great pleasure to drink and a good value at $21. As we found when drinking vins de soifs in June, sometimes delicious is enough.

Alain Graillot’s Crozes offers similar flavors. It, too, is delicious, with flavors of roasted meats, black peppers and olives. But where the Equinoxe was soft, easy and exuberant, the Graillot was smoothly structured. It was also floral and starkly mineral, with earthy, stony elements. I found the wine lovely, compelling and thoughtful. It’s also $35 rather than $21.

This is a wine that for me most definitely speaks of a place. It doesn’t have the elegance and persistence of Côte-Rôtie or the power of Hermitage, but that helps to let you know it is not from one of the elite terroirs of the region. That is not a knock; it is only rarely an occasion worthy of one of those wines, which to me makes everyday bottles all the more important.

I found it fascinating to compare these two wines, which most likely were overseen by the same man, Maxime Graillot, who has taken over some of the winemaking duties at his father’s estate. Yet the grapes come from different places and the winemaking techniques are different. Most notably, the grapes for the Equinoxe were destemmed before fermentation, while the grapes for the Graillot were not.

This decision seems to have particular cultural significance in the northern Rhône, where the question of whether to destem can shape the character of a wine in a less subtle way than in, say, Burgundy.

Destemming is a more modern technique, as it depends on the technology for automating the destemming process, which otherwise would be laborious. It tends to enhance the fruitiness of the wine. Fermenting the wine with the stems tends to produce more savory elements as well as more tannins, for a more structured wine.

The decision of whether to destem is often a philosophical choice, but it can be a practical one as well. I once asked Bernard Faurie, who makes excellent, traditional Hermitage, why he chose not to destem his grapes.

“God made grapes with stems for a reason,” he said. “It gives the wine long life and energy. Besides, I didn’t want to pay for a destemming machine.”

The grapes for the Alain Graillot come from his vineyard on the plain in Crozes-Hermitage, near the hamlet of Les Chênes Verts. Ordinarily, I would imagine the grapes from this area have less potential than those from the few granite hillside vineyards in Crozes-Hermitage. But the vineyard — unusually for the region, Mr. Graillot once told me — is set in an stony, sandy ancient riverbed, which perhaps adds to the character of the grapes.

The Equinoxe is Maxime Graillot’s négociant line of wines, meaning he buys the grapes. They come from vineyards near the Graillot family estate, from the commune of Beaumont-Monteux, and I believe the soils are somewhat similar. The main differences seem to be the destemming, and the intent to make an easy-drinking wine rather than a wine that ought to age and improve for a decade.

By contrast, half of the grapes for the Chave Silène are from estate vineyards — on a granite slope behind the great hill of Hermitage — and the other half are purchased. The wine tasted richer and riper than the other two, and at 14 percent, it was a percentage point higher in alcohol. The Silène was juicy like the Equinoxe, but as full of minerality as the Graillot, with equally fine tannins. The wine was floral but also with a touch of chocolate and not so much of the olive, roasted-meat flavors.

For me, the Silène occupied a middle ground between the two other wines. It had that extra dimension of place that set it apart from the easygoing Equinoxe, but not to the extent of the Graillot. Nonetheless, I would still consider it a wine of place.

I was happy with each of these three wines, and pleased that they each showed a different face of a region that should not be reflexively maligned. Like St.-Joseph, its stablemate in the category of midprice northern Rhônes, Crozes-Hermitage can outperform expectations. If it does not quite have the potential of St.-Joseph to truly excel, it certainly can rise to the occasion of solid, pleasurable wines of place.

I asked readers who might have remembered drinking St.-Josephs in early 2015 how these Crozes-Hermitages compared. Martin Schappeit of Forest, Va., said the St.-Josephs were more structured and complex. Joseph of Île de France echoed the sentiment, saying they were not as thrilling. George Erdle of Charlotte, N.C., simply stated that Crozes-Hermitage was “vastly different” from St.-Joseph.

Each of these Crozes producers also makes an equivalent bottling of St.-Joseph, and it would be illuminating to make some fresh comparisons. Extra credit, anybody?

Not surprisingly, some readers had different opinions about these wines than my own. VSB of San Francisco seemed to like the Alain Graillot, but called it “port-like,” and found a lingering hot, astringent quality. Dan Barron of New York found the Equinoxe too sour, although he found the Silène complex and juicy.

Martina Zuccarello of New York, on the other hand, saw the Graillot as I did. “The wine was buzzing, not of youth but of life and place,” she said. “It is really a sensational quality that takes this wine from the ordinary to the extraordinary.”

Not every wine has that extra dimension, and plenty of wines that do not can be satisfying. But finding a wine that speaks so directly to you is the great reward of exploration.

The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, after hitting 3.1 percent in the spring, a level that prompted President Trump to suggest that “we’re really on our way” to sustaining that pace year-round. “On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,” Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August.

But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.

With legislation embodying the party’s tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that “our economy produced solid growth last quarter” and went on to say that tax reform was a way to “continue this growth” and “reinvigorate America’s economy.”

On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan — a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent — would affect economic growth. They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified.

The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party’s case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment — and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.

Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. “The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,” Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. “Keep on rockin’ steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there’s no need for a big, wasteful tax cut.”

The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed’s plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.

Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed’s reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen’s term ends in early February.

The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the country’s steady growth — a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September — but became more optimistic in recent weeks.

After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.

“If you don’t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.”

The destruction wrought by the storms was outweighed by the continued spending of consumers and businesses. The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs. Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show.

“There are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “We are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll.”

Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising.

“Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,” said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West.

Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were “a sign that consumers are hanging tough.”

At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.

The weak dollar through much of this year has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex., a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.

“Things are picking up — I sense it in Europe,” Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities. “Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,” he said.

The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.

6 Spooky Travel Destinations for the Halloween Season

With all the attention Thanksgiving and Christmas get from travelers, it’s easy to overlook Halloween as a destination holiday. While a few cities provide a spooky vibe year-round, annual festivals, theme park pop-up events and other haunted happenings elsewhere have helped make the holiday a travel mini-season all its own.

New Orleans

Home to voodoo legends and year-round cemetery walks, New Orleans is among the cities that naturally harmonize with Halloween. Worth noting every October is the Krewe of Boo, happening this year on Oct. 21. The family-friendly, Mardi-Gras-inspired Halloween parade has floats devoted to themes like werewolves and vampires. Float riders throw trinkets to the crowd, including locally made candy. New Orleans hosts plenty of after-event parties, but the procession itself draws all ages in costume.

Transylvania

The region most associated with Dracula — one of Gothic horror’s most famous villains — Transylvania is well worth discovering in its own right. This swath of central and western Romania is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved and its ethnic and political history rich and complex.

But yes, there’s also that medieval clock tower in the well-preserved center of the town of Sighisoara — with a torture chamber beneath — across the street from the house where Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler of Walachia (a region that later became part of Romania) is said to have been born in 1431. He is believed by many to have inspired the fictional character of Dracula, though some dispute that. There’s also Bran Castle, which is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula.

Whitby, England

This picturesque town on England’s Yorkshire coast can also stake claim to being the home of Dracula, though in a different way. Bram Stoker spent just a month in Whitby, but those four weeks in July and August 1890 were pivotal in the creation of his most famous book, “Dracula,” which was published in 1897. Whitby celebrated the 125th anniversary of Stoker’s visit in 2015, but this year you can see the skeletal remains of Whitby Abbey illuminated throughout the final week of October.

Salem, Mass.

Home to the infamous witch trials of the early 1690s, it should come as no surprise that this town is a hotbed for Halloween activity. One way Salem builds on its spectral past is with the monthlong Festival of the Dead . Events include psychic readings, séances, a Halloween ball, a mourning-themed tea and, on Halloween night, a witches gathering. For more, look to the city’s official website dedicated to numerous other Halloween-themed events.

There’s also plenty to do that isn’t witch-themed, like a visit to the Peabody-Essex Museum , founded in 1799 as the East India Marine Society, a “cabinet of natural and artificial curiosities” where local captains involved in the China trade donated items from their wide-ranging travels. You can also tour the House of the Seven Gables, made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1951 novel.

Derry, Northern Ireland

Halloween is believed by many to have its roots in the ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, which was celebrated by Derry’s ancestors. Selected as the top Halloween destination in the world in a USA Today readers’ poll last year, Derry (or Londonderry, as it is also known) seems to do everything it can each year to earn such a reputation. About 80,000 people attended the 30th annual Derry Halloween festival last year.

Derry has done much to overcome its tumultuous past as the birthplace of the Troubles , the three-decade-long struggle between Irish nationalists and Protestant “loyalists,” who sought to keep Northern Ireland part of the United Kingdom. The centerpiece of the town is the soaring Peace Bridge that opened over the River Foyle in 2011.

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

While the bodies of three dead Americans and the team’s Nigerien interpreter were found hours later, it took two more days for American, French and Nigerien troops to find the body of the fourth soldier, Sergeant Johnson, in woods near the ambush site.

Pentagon officials said the operation was similar to dozens of train-and-assist reconnaissance missions, in which contact with enemy forces was considered unlikely. American forces in Niger operate under strict rules that forbid them to go on missions that could involve enemy encounters. Some news reports, however, suggested that the soldiers were part of a larger mission to track down a suspected militant leader.

This raises many questions: Was the mission changed after the Green Berets left their operating base? Were they given bad intelligence or did they misinterpret what they were told? Why did the soldiers wait so long to call for help? Why did it take so long to locate the body of Sergeant Johnson? The location of the ambush was “inherently dangerous,” Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters this week.

That so many questions have been raised and left unanswered raises yet another serious question: What exactly is the true mission of American troops in Africa?

American officials say their troops have a light footprint in Niger, but experts say local populations often view the foreign military presence in Africa — France has an even bigger operation — as heavy-handed, provoking a backlash against local and Western governments.

Congress has funded advise-and-assist missions since before the Africa command was established in 2008, as Al Qaeda and other extremist groups spread into northern Africa. Under threat, Niger welcomed such assistance and is a major recipient of counterterrorism assistance in Africa.

Still, John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and other senators are complaining that the Pentagon has not fully informed Congress about what it’s doing in Africa. He recently threatened to subpoena Pentagon officials about the Niger fiasco, before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis agreed to meet with him.

While the Pentagon has described the Niger operation as a noncombat, train-and-assist mission, it needs to explain whether Mr. Trump’s decision to loosen the rules on counterterrorism operations, giving more decision-making authority to lower-level officers, changed the nature of engagement and put more troops at risk. The president himself has shown little interest in Africa.

The lack of clarity about the Niger operation is one more reason for Congress to replace the 2001 law authorizing military force against Al Qaeda with legislation to address current threats like the Islamic State, limit American interventions and ensure regular congressional oversight.

The name of the song? “Eminem Esque.”

“He didn’t really have the patience” for a detailed explanation of the math, Mr. Rechnitz recalled telling Mr. Huberfeld.","In the second day of his testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz, who is cooperating with the government after pleading guilty to a fraud conspiracy charge, continued to elucidate the control Mr. Seabrook exercised over the city’s more than 10,000 correction officers and their millions of dollars in retirement funds. Mr. Seabrook is accused of steering some of those funds into a high-risk investment fund in return for promised kickbacks; Mr. Rechnitz said he helped negotiate the deal.

In particular, Mr. Rechnitz hinted at the power Mr. Seabrook had wielded, before his arrest last June, to block Mr. de Blasio’s attempts to reform Rikers Island, one of the mayor’s key political promises.

“Norman had been outspoken that the new head of correction was the wrong choice to lead the correction department,” Mr. Rechnitz said, referring to Mr. de Blasio’s appointment in 2014 of Joseph Ponte, a reform-minded commissioner, to lead the city’s embattled jail system. “Since Bill and I spoke often, he also knew that I was friends with Norman, and he was frustrated with Norman for not giving Ponte a chance.”

Mr. Rechnitz, who was a target of federal and state inquiries into Mr. de Blasio’s fund-raising, said he had already ingratiated himself with City Hall through hefty campaign donations. (Prosecutors decided in March not to bring charges in the fund-raising inquiry.) In late 2013 and 2014, Mr. Rechnitz said, he was working to cultivate the same influence with Mr. Seabrook.

He bought him crocodile dress shoes and took him on vacations to the Dominican Republic. He introduced him to Murray Huberfeld, a financier in whose hedge fund Mr. Seabrook would eventually invest $20 million of union money, and who is now Mr. Seabrook’s co-defendant.

“I told Bill as a favor to him I would get Norman to meet with Bill and be nicer to Ponte,” Mr. Rechnitz said. “I got back to him to let him know that Norman was under control.”

Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Rechnitz said, had told him that he would be less outspoken in the media about his opposition to Mr. Ponte.

Mr. Rechnitz said the mayor also called him in 2014 to request a $102,300 donation to help the Democrats retain control of the State Senate.

Mr. de Blasio has denied any friendship with Mr. Rechnitz and said he never knew him personally.

“If Jona Rechnitz says he bought the mayor, he is a liar,” Eric Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, said in a statement Friday. “If he says he had unfettered access, he is a liar. The only thing Jona Rechnitz can say honestly is that he is a failed fixer of grand delusion just trying to save his own skin.”

Although Mr. Rechnitz touted his ability to control Mr. Seabrook, he was still taken with the union leader’s influence. He testified that in an effort to impress Mr. Seabrook, he told him lies: that he owned a yacht that he had in reality rented, or that he owned a building for which he was only the manager.

He believed that Mr. Seabrook would connect him to Thomas DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller, even emailing Mr. Huberfeld to tell him that he had a meeting set up. (The meeting never took place, Mr. Rechnitz said.) And at dinner at a Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Huberfeld and Mr. Seabrook discussed the possibility of Mr. Seabrook running for mayor.

Mr. Huberfeld told Mr. Seabrook that he “would be a great mayor and that we would support him,” Mr. Rechnitz recalled.

In March 2014, Mr. Rechnitz paid for himself, his friend Jeremy Reichberg, Mr. Seabrook and Philip Banks III, then the top chief in the New York Police Department, to travel to Israel. Photos introduced by the government showed Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Banks praying together in a temple, or visiting Jerusalem’s Western Wall. In one photo, Mr. Banks is shown giving New York Police Department shields with blessings written in Hebrew to local police officers.

At the time, Mr. Rechnitz said, he was working to persuade Mr. Seabrook to invest more of the union’s money into Mr. Huberfeld’s hedge fund. Earlier that month, Mr. Seabrook had secured an initial $10 million investment.

By then, Mr. Rechnitz said, not only had he had gathered that Mr. Seabrook had the power to control the union’s funds; he had also realized that Mr. Seabrook was not much interested in the exact formula for calculating his promised kickbacks.

“He didn’t really have the patience” for a detailed explanation of the math, Mr. Rechnitz recalled telling Mr. Huberfeld. “He just wanted to know: ‘Bottom line, what do you think I’m making?’”",De Blasio Donor Says He Helped Mayor Get Ex-Jail Guards Chief ‘Under Control’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/seabrook-trial.html

Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets.
“They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html

Trump, of course, has never apologized for giving comfort to people who marched on behalf of a confederacy of slaveholders. And we all know that race would be an issue if a black occupant of the White House had fathered five children with three women, attacked grieving combat widows and exploited the office for personal gain.

But when people shame fellow citizens with the blunt edge of identity politics, they only encourage the backlash that gave us Trump.

White people who are not privileged — the poor, the uneducated, the struggling — feel belittled when elite whites scorn their “privilege.” What’s privileged about living paycheck to paycheck? About eight million citizens voted for President Obama — twice — and then flipped their vote for Trump. Most of them, surely, are not racist.

What they heard from Obama was the best American music. “In no other country is my story even possible,” he said in his 2008 speech on race. After noting that he won some of the whitest counties in the country, he criticized a view “that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above what we know is right with America.”

To dismiss white concern over busing or affirmative action as racist “only widens the racial divide and increases misunderstanding,” he said. Yet, that is exactly what many liberal whites and blacks are doing now. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his new book of essays, compares gentrification, which comes in many colors, to “a more pleasing name for white supremacy.”

He’s been getting pushback from African-Americans with a more expansive view. “Coates has convinced me that his particular brand of anti-racism does more political harm than good,” wrote Cedric Johnson, a professor of African-American studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, in an essay last year.

Certainly Steven Bannon knows that. He has repeatedly said that the more Democrats talk about identity and race, the more it helps his white nationalistic cause.

If all cultural appropriation is bad — extending even to, say, an Italian-American chef becoming expert in North African food — then we are doomed. If everyone is a racist, then no one can be saved from an awful destiny at birth.

Most Americans now feel their own group faces discrimination, according to a new NPR poll. A majority of whites say that discrimination exists against whites, even though a majority have not personally experienced it.

This is a tragic result of the retreat to tribal quarters, pushed by extremists on both sides. If it persists, the United States that Obama celebrated cannot hold.

Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film — and not just as deaf characters.
“It’s hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers,” Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body.
In the summer hit “Baby Driver,” for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights.
It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.","Millie Simmonds plays Rose, a lonely deaf girl in 1927 New Jersey enamored of silent movies and of one star in particular (played by Julianne Moore, the hearing actress who also plays the grown-up Rose). Rose’s story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977. In Brian Selznick’s best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Rose’s story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Ben’s is shared entirely in words. In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing ’70s pop color but — for nearly an hour — no dialogue.

“I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film,” Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview. To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day. He became aware of “acute shards of visual information,” he said, though he wasn’t kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: “This was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.”

Like Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences. Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture. Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college. The couple were advisers for “Wonderstruck,” both the book and the movie.

Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film — and not just as deaf characters. Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles — a policeman and a maid, among others — in “Wonderstruck,” and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie. “There was one I missed,” she said, “which is a good sign of his acting. I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look ‘less intently’ at others so they would seem more hearing.”

But authenticity works both ways. “It’s hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers,” Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body. “For hearing viewers,” she said, “being ‘deaf’ is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, it’s the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking. Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.”

Mr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and “the only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.” He turned to Ms. Moore. “She took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.”

Mr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie “succeeded way better than most,” but he also said that “you can’t achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.”

Even films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first. In the summer hit “Baby Driver,” for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights. But Mr. Humphries pointed out that “the editing cut into CJ’s signed lines so much we often couldn’t see his signing” and added, “That’s reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.”

Ms. Matlin said that “not so much” has changed since “Children of a Lesser God” when it comes to studio movies. In independent films, “where budgets are smaller,” she said, “risks can be taken, and there has been some progress.” A recent Ukrainian film, “The Tribe,” has gone further than any Hollywood movie. It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.

Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, “there are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers — and lots of stories to tell.”

Chief among those stories may have been the cable series “Switched at Birth,” which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L. A current example is the ABC series “Quantico,” now shooting Season 3 in New York. Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in “Switched at Birth”) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I. agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast. “They just put me in and have had no qualms about ‘How do we do it?’” she emailed from the set.

In films, by contrast, there isn’t much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: “Usually they’re victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.”

Ethan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not “waiting for hearing Hollywood to call” but taking matters into their own hands.

“Deaf filmmaking is ascendant,” he said in an email, “likely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.” He also said that he was “gobsmacked” by the success of “Switched at Birth,” adding, “I never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.”

Millie Simmonds has seen neither “The Tribe” nor “Children of a Lesser God” (they both have very adult themes), and she “never, never never” dreamed of being an actress. “I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous,” she said. But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, “A Quiet Place,” with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.

In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.
They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.","On one side are employees who idealize Facebook’s lofty goals of unfettered speech and do not think the company should be in the business of censoring what its users have to say. On the other side are workers who worry that the company’s hands-off approach has already caused problems — ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.

“The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control what’s shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology. “The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.”

Next week, Facebook’s general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last year’s election.

Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.

Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election. It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.

And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook. That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.

But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.

Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.

Aided by Facebook’s finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users. The ad product, called a “promoted post,” was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.

Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians. If they did, it meant that nonpaid, “organic” posts would begin to appear in the users’ News Feeds. From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the user’s network of friends.

The tactic was effective. Some of the pages, like “Blacktivists,” which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who “liked” the page — even more than the main “Black Lives Matter” page.

Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue. But at Mr. Zuckerberg’s company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.

Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network. Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence. But misleading users — even outright lying — aren’t necessarily against the rules. And that’s hard to police.

So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform. Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.

“We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial,” Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement. “That’s O.K. But it’s important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.”

That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States. In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.

Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.

One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been “whitelisting,” in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the company’s internal deliberations. They have also discussed “blacklisting,” in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.

But in closed-door meetings at Facebook’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.

Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves. They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.

As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction. But today’s A.I. technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg’s solution is to double down on his community concept. He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.

“Every day, I say to myself, ‘I don’t have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?’ Some nights I go to bed and I’m not sure I made the right choices that day,” Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference. “I can tell you, those doubts don’t go away, no matter who you are. But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.”","At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/facebook-fake-content-employees.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It occupies a position in the canon that is unusual even by opera’s stubbornly backward-looking standards, particularly in Europe. The Vienna State Opera and the Teatro alla Scala in Milan both still use Zeffirelli stagings from 1963, and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich continues to present an Otto Schenk one from 1969.

But this fall brings a highly unusual coincidence: new productions of the opera at two of Europe’s most important houses. At the Royal Opera in London, Richard Jones’s fresh version — the company’s first since 1974 — recently finished its premiere run here and will return in June. And on Dec. 1, the Paris Opera will unveil Claus Guth’s provocative staging, set a century from now.

These new takes on this classic of classics raise the question of whether “La Bohème” should be messed with at all. We seem to have an almost instinctive desire for this piece to remain the same, to be the opera we encountered as children. Is that something we should resist or accept?

And if it’s indeed fair game for new approaches: How? When a director sets Wagner’s “Ring” cycle at, say, the dawn of industrialization, it illuminates new aspects of a deep, ambiguous work. But while doing “Bohème” in the 1950s or, à la “Rent,” in the AIDS-era East Village may involve a change of clothes, it’s still the same, simple love story.

So forget should you do a new “Bohème”: Can you do a new — a really new — “Bohème”? Is there an approach to this work that isn’t just moving the attic stove, a fixture of the libretto, from stage right to left to center?

Mr. Jones’s strong, even hyperbolic, Royal Opera production tries diligently to bridge old-fashioned and progressive. It begins with the element perhaps most associated with the piece: snow, already falling gently onstage in front of the curtain as the audience enters.

The Victorian-era costumes are detailed and elaborate, a contrast with the austere settings, often flooded in harsh frontal lighting. There is hardly any furniture in the young bohemians’ Paris garret, making the space resemble an empty stage. The audience can see the backstage workings throughout: the lighting rigs, even the snow machine tube rotating overhead in the flies.

The sets of previous acts are visible just offstage; scene changes take place in full view. You can see stagehand markings in chalk on the back of the set pieces; the characters then make their own charcoal drawings — musical notes and all — in the final act. We are in a theater, Mr. Jones is at pains to remind us, and this is an opera.

Within this lightly Brechtian frame, the acting is more or less naturalistic, with a few cartoonish touches. In the first act, when she comes upstairs to light her candle, the already ill Mimì faints dead away; rather than being concerned, Rodolfo is almost amused, tapping her with his foot. In the second act, at Café Momus, the hellcat Musetta doesn’t just flirt with the crowd but pulls off her underwear and throws it; she and her estranged lover, Marcello, boisterously kiss the same woman. (Suffice to say a bit of casual bisexuality isn’t on offer in most “Bohème” productions.)

The staging manages to infuse the old war horse with a genuine mood — a real, if occasionally exaggerated, melancholy — without alienating those looking for hoop skirts and a parade at the end of Act 2. But in the end, it’s more or less just a shift of the stove.

The coming Paris production, the details of which are being closely kept, will not be nearly so indulgent of audience expectations. “The second the curtain opens, you have a fist in your face,” Mr. Guth, the director, said in a phone interview.

Mr. Guth, acclaimed for stylized, even surreal productions that nevertheless remain moored to reality, hadn’t thought his style was a good match for Puccini, and he didn’t like the clichés about artists endemic to “Bohème” stagings. But listening to the music alone and brainstorming conceptual approaches brought him to the 1851 Henri Murger book on which the libretto is based.

“In the end,” he said, “it turns out that these men meet again. They look back, and they are not now artists. They are now established bourgeoisie. They remember their youth, when they were doing wild stuff.”

Photo

So his “Bohème,” which will star Sonya Yoncheva and Atalla Ayan and be conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, takes the form of a kind of flashback to a lost time — much as Paris today, he observed, is a kind of fantasy of what the city once was.

“He wants to put ‘La Bohème’ at the end of the 21st century, in the future,” Stéphane Lissner, the general director of the Paris Opera, said in an interview in his office. “To speak about what is the artist’s situation, what is the memory we have of the past.”

The marketing image on the company’s website is a futuristic-looking pod, which is apparently where at least some of the action will take place. This radical intervention replaces Jonathan Miller’s staging from 1995, which updated the opera to the 1930s Left Bank but otherwise left it mostly alone. That staging has, Mr. Lissner said, “not one idea for me. The Jonathan Miller is for me absolutely nothing. So it’s time to try.”

Mr. Guth’s concept bears some similarity to the director Stefan Herheim’s, unveiled in Oslo in 2012 and available on a crucial DVD. That production uses the traditional storybook sets of the Norwegian National Opera’s 1963 “Bohème,” but begins with a bleakly modern scene: a hospital room in which a man’s lover has just died of cancer.

The “La Bohème” we know then emerges as his fantasy of her recuperation, though a fantasy shot through with intimations of darkness and death. As in “The Wizard of Oz,” the doctors and nurses from the hospital also populate this Rodolfo’s dream world; it is one of the saddest, loveliest spectacles I’ve ever seen.

Photo

Mr. Herheim’s staging is about loss and denial. It’s also about what we seek from opera, the kind of escape into an idyllic past — our culture’s and our own — that we get from productions like Mr. Zeffirelli’s, which over the past 35 years at the Met has played nearly 500 performances and sold 650,000 tickets.

I would not want to be without Mr. Herheim’s vision, which celebrates, without undue indulgence, the sentimentality that permeates “La Bohème.” But I’ve lately been more than reconciled to the Zeffirelli, the age and familiarity of which have added a poignancy that enhances the piece — that, in some sense, completes it.

I felt differently about the Met’s ancient production of Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier,” finally replaced last season. The old staging had grown dull and dowdy — and besides, “Rosenkavalier” is not just a simulacrum of 18th-century Vienna but is also about what the new version, set on the cusp of World War I, made more vivid: the change of generations, the war of the classes, the end of a world.

The old “Rosenkavalier” didn’t evoke any of those depths; the Zeffirelli “Bohème,” on the other hand, really does give us “La Bohème,” in all its shallow brilliance and beauty. The nostalgia we feel for it has become as much a part of the opera as Puccini’s score. I look forward to the avant-garde iteration of the staging that will commence in a few decades, when the singers will need to negotiate a literally decomposing set; what better symbol of Mimì’s fatal consumption?

But, until then, why move the stove merely to move it?

“Whether you like them or don’t like them, we have changed the core repertory at the Met,” Mr. Gelb said. “This is a piece that just defies that agenda.”",‘La Bohème’: Should Opera’s Most Beloved Classic Be Changed?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/music/la-boheme-puccini-opera-metropolitan-london-paris.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They stay in motel rooms, often far enough from the events to avoid detection, or on campgrounds after trading suggestions on Facebook, Gab and Twitter.

“My general take is that the number of people who are highly motivated and dedicated to this stuff are relatively small in number,” said George Hawley, who teaches political science at the University of Alabama and is the author of a recent book about the alt-right. “But the ones who are and have the capacity to do so are willing to make long trips.”

Alt-right supporters headed on Saturday to two “White Lives Matter” rallies in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, in Central Tennessee. Organizers chose the region to protest the resettlement of refugees in the area, and to call attention to the shooting last month at a predominantly white church that killed one person and injured several others. The man jailed in the shooting, who is black, left a note that referred to Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

In preparation for the rallies, Occidental Dissent, a website popular among white nationalists, offered recommendations and guidelines on topics including attire (white or black polo shirts and khakis “to make a good impression”) and chants (“Blood and Soil!”), as well as a preview of a private event described as “a time to relax, socialize and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people in our movement after two hours of pro-White activism.”

On Friday, about 20 demonstrators, including Harry Hughes from Arizona, had dinner together at an Olive Garden.

“I come to these events routinely because I think we have a message, and we also look for reaction from the public,” said Mr. Hughes, a member of a neo-Nazi group who said he often adds sightseeing to his trips.

Traveling for such events, he said, was no different from music fans making long drives for concerts.

But it was apparently ideology that led the three men from Texas this month to Florida, where they remain jailed on bonds of at least $1 million each.

They had growing histories as activists who were willing to travel from their homes in the Houston area to support the alt-right, and all three attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly when, according to the police, a white nationalist from Ohio drove his car into a crowd. One of the men arrested in Florida, William H. Fears, had also surfaced at other events, including at least three in Texas, according to news and social media accounts of the events.

A few hours before the shooting, Mr. Fears, who faces a charge of attempted homicide, spoke to The Gainesville Sun about what he depicted as the movement’s newfound aggression.

“We’re starting to push back, we’re starting to want to intimidate back,” he told the newspaper. “We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we’re not to be taken lightly. We don’t want violence, we don’t want harm, but at the end of the day, we’re not opposed to defending ourselves.”

On Friday, asked about the charges against Mr. Fears and the other men, Mr. Spencer said: “If the allegations are correct, then they really did a bad thing. It’s not defensible, to be honest.”

But Mr. Spencer and his allies have no plans to abandon the events that prompt controversy and turmoil.

“We’re breaking a taboo,” said Mr. Griffin, who also oversees public relations for the League of the South, which describes itself as a “Southern nationalist” organization, and who helped promote Saturday’s rallies. “We might have supporters in the area, we might have supporters in the state, but the number of people who are willing to take those risks always reduces turnout.”

The movement’s most fervent activists are often met by left-wing opponents, like those in the Antifa movement, who have a similar, if more extensive, history of traveling. They normally benefit, observers said, from long-established networks that support liberal protesters, sometimes offering meals and couches to crash on.

Starting with the street clashes in Seattle during the World Trade Organization conference in 1999, “you just see this roving band that was at everything,” said Scott Crow, a longtime liberal activist and author who lives in Texas. “You’re probably not seeing the same Antifa people at every Richard Spencer rally, but there are people who are probably at many of those things or the big ones.”

Federal officials have long paid close attention to activists all along the political spectrum, sometimes infiltrating groups they consider extreme. Yet traveling demonstrators, no matter their ideological alignment, often pose particular challenges for the local authorities, who may have little experience handling volatile protests and limited knowledge about people who come from afar.

Social media platforms and the internet only add to the challenge, experts said. While technology yields greater opportunities for intelligence gathering, it also allows for greater coordination among some extremists who, until recently, would have probably stayed close to home.

“They were geographically isolated, they would interact with others and, on occasion, they would travel,” said John D. Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. “What’s different today than, say, five years ago is that more and more people seem to be self-connecting with the cause of white supremacy versus joining a white supremacist group.”

And experts said a blend of easy access and coordination, as well as perceptions of a hands-off approach to policing past rallies, sometimes draws outspoken activists who ordinarily would have remained “underground.”

On the web page with instructions and guidelines for the demonstrations in Tennessee, Mr. Griffin included an admonishment that “another Charlottesville” is “not in our interest.” Rather, one of the weekend’s stated objectives was to “foster greater unity and cohesion within our own movement.”

Mr. Griffin, despite his movement’s record of failing to attract many local supporters, said he was hoping Tennesseans would be more open to their beliefs than Charlottesville residents were.",A Roadshow of Hate: Supremacist Rallies Fueled by Travelers From Afar,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/white-supremacists-rallies.html

Rose’s story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977. In Brian Selznick’s best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Rose’s story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Ben’s is shared entirely in words. In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing ’70s pop color but — for nearly an hour — no dialogue.

“I was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film,” Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview. To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day. He became aware of “acute shards of visual information,” he said, though he wasn’t kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: “This was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.”

Like Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences. Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture. Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college. The couple were advisers for “Wonderstruck,” both the book and the movie.

Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film — and not just as deaf characters. Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles — a policeman and a maid, among others — in “Wonderstruck,” and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie. “There was one I missed,” she said, “which is a good sign of his acting. I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look ‘less intently’ at others so they would seem more hearing.”

But authenticity works both ways. “It’s hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers,” Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body. “For hearing viewers,” she said, “being ‘deaf’ is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, it’s the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking. Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.”

Mr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and “the only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.” He turned to Ms. Moore. “She took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.”

Mr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie “succeeded way better than most,” but he also said that “you can’t achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.”

Even films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first. In the summer hit “Baby Driver,” for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights. But Mr. Humphries pointed out that “the editing cut into CJ’s signed lines so much we often couldn’t see his signing” and added, “That’s reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.”

Ms. Matlin said that “not so much” has changed since “Children of a Lesser God” when it comes to studio movies. In independent films, “where budgets are smaller,” she said, “risks can be taken, and there has been some progress.” A recent Ukrainian film, “The Tribe,” has gone further than any Hollywood movie. It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.

Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, “there are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers — and lots of stories to tell.”

Chief among those stories may have been the cable series “Switched at Birth,” which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L. A current example is the ABC series “Quantico,” now shooting Season 3 in New York. Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in “Switched at Birth”) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I. agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast. “They just put me in and have had no qualms about ‘How do we do it?’” she emailed from the set.

In films, by contrast, there isn’t much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: “Usually they’re victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.”

Ethan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not “waiting for hearing Hollywood to call” but taking matters into their own hands.

“Deaf filmmaking is ascendant,” he said in an email, “likely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.” He also said that he was “gobsmacked” by the success of “Switched at Birth,” adding, “I never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.”

Millie Simmonds has seen neither “The Tribe” nor “Children of a Lesser God” (they both have very adult themes), and she “never, never never” dreamed of being an actress. “I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous,” she said. But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, “A Quiet Place,” with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.

There is little doubt, though, that Amazon is interested in at least some aspects of the pharmacy business. Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant who worked at Amazon until earlier this year on groceries and other initiatives, said he participated in discussions about how Amazon could enter the category, including through acquisitions.

“The pharmacy business was always a topic of interest when I was with Amazon, and there was a sincere desire on the part of Amazon to create a better customer experience across pharmacy and health care as a whole,” he said.

While Mr. Ladd said he isn’t privy to the company’s current strategy, he believes existing pharmacy companies are right to be worried. “My advice is that executives at pharmaceutical companies should crush all assumptions when it comes to Amazon and their ability to enter, innovate and reimagine the pharmacy business and health care,” he said.

If Amazon decides to enter the market, it could take a variety of avenues, analysts said.

The easiest way in would be to set up a mail-order pharmacy that focused on price-sensitive customers without health insurance or who have high-deductible plans that require them to pay for some drug costs upfront. To do this, Amazon would need retail pharmacy licenses in every state — a hurdle, certainly, but not an insurmountable one, the analysts said.

“They can at least dip their toe in the water with the cash-pay customers, and learn the business,” said Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink Partners.

She said cash-paying customers account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the $560 billion prescription drug business.

The idea could prove attractive to customers who already go to Amazon for a wide range of shopping items, from shoes to electronics to diapers. Retailers like Target and Walmart have added pharmacies to bring in extra business for a similar reason. Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods could also provide a physical location for pharmacies.

“A large part of the infrastructure is already there,” said David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo.

In a call with analysts this week, Timothy C. Wentworth, the chief executive of the pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts, indicated a willingness to work with Amazon to reach these cash-paying customers. “We certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator,” he said.

If Amazon wanted to go bigger, Ms. Gupte and others said, it could sell to insured customers and even serve as a pharmacy-benefit manager, overseeing drug coverage for people on behalf of insurers and large employers.

This would be far more complex. It would likely require Amazon to either acquire a pharmacy-benefit manager or enter into a partnership with an existing one. Expanding the pharmacy business without the aid of a major pharmacy-benefit manager would be tough, because the benefit managers serve as gatekeepers to insured patients, deciding which pharmacies they can and cannot use. The benefit managers also operate their own mail-order pharmacies, which might make them less willing to accommodate Amazon.

Some said they expect that if Amazon chooses to enter the health care business, it would do so in a big way. The company could attempt to provide comprehensive services to patients, doctors and others, far beyond selling drugs.

Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at Willis Towers Watson, said other areas the company could explore include offering virtual doctor consults, or using the Amazon Echo, its voice-controlled smart device, for health care applications.

No matter the short-term steps Amazon is taking, Ms. Rosier said, her research has demonstrated that it is “clearly looking to revolutionize how health care is delivered in some way.”

But while Amazon has a track record for upending major industries, from books to groceries, she said health care is complicated and there would be intense pressure to get it right. “It is just a sensitive topic,” she said. “We don’t have as much scrutiny of how much you paid for your jeans, or your shoes.”","Hearing Amazon’s Footsteps, the Health Care Industry Shudders",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/amazon-pharmacy-drugs.html

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

Photo

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes.

AKRON, Ohio — Drug overdose deaths in 2016 most likely exceeded 59,000, the largest annual jump ever recorded in the United States, according to preliminary data compiled by The New York Times.

The death count is the latest consequence of an escalating public health crisis: opioid addiction, now made more deadly by an influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and similar drugs. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50.

Although the data is preliminary, the Times’s best estimate is that deaths rose 19 percent over the 52,404 recorded in 2015. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017.

Drug overdose deaths, 1980 to 2016 *Estimate based on preliminary data

Because drug deaths take a long time to certify, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be able to calculate final numbers until December. The Times compiled estimates for 2016 from hundreds of state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners. Together they represent data from states and counties that accounted for 76 percent of overdose deaths in 2015. They are a first look at the extent of the drug overdose epidemic last year, a detailed accounting of a modern plague.

The initial data points to large increases in drug overdose deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, we estimate overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.

“Heroin is the devil’s drug, man. It is,” Cliff Parker said, sitting on a bench in Grace Park in Akron. Mr. Parker, 24, graduated from high school not too far from here, in nearby Copley, where he was a multisport athlete. In his senior year, he was a varsity wrestler and earned a scholarship to the University of Akron. Like his friends and teammates, he started using prescription painkillers at parties. It was fun, he said. By the time it stopped being fun, it was too late. Pills soon turned to heroin, and his life began slipping away from him.

Mr. Parker’s story is familiar in the Akron area. From a distance, it would be easy to paint Akron — “Rubber Capital of the World” — as a stereotypical example of Rust Belt decay. But that’s far from a complete picture. While manufacturing jobs have declined and the recovery from the 2008 recession has been slow, unemployment in Summit County, where Akron sits, is roughly in line with the United States as a whole. The Goodyear factories have been retooled into technology centers for research and polymer science. The city has begun to rebuild. But deaths from drug overdose here have skyrocketed.

In 2016, Summit County had 312 drug deaths, according to Gary Guenther, the county medical examiner’s chief investigator — a 46 percent increase from 2015 and more than triple the 99 cases that went through the medical examiner’s office just two years before. There were so many last year, Mr. Guenther said, that on three separate occasions the county had to request refrigerated trailers to store the bodies because they’d run out of space in the morgue.

It’s not unique to Akron. Coroners’ offices throughout the state are being overwhelmed.

In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 99 tested positive for fentanyl or an analogue.

Fentanyl isn’t new. But over the past three years, it has been popping up in drug seizures across the country.

Most of the time, it’s sold on the street as heroin, or drug traffickers use it to make cheap counterfeit prescription opioids. Fentanyls are showing up in cocaine as well, contributing to an increase in cocaine-related overdoses.

The most deadly of the fentanyl analogues is carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer 5,000 times stronger than heroin. An amount smaller than a few grains of salt can be a lethal dose.

“July 5th, 2016 — that’s the day carfentanil hit the streets of Akron,” said Capt. Michael Shearer, the commander of the Narcotics Unit for the Akron Police Department. On that day, 17 people overdosed and one person died in a span of nine hours. Over the next six months, the county medical examiner recorded 140 overdose deaths of people testing positive for carfentanil. Just three years earlier, there were fewer than a hundred drug overdose deaths of any kind for the entire year.

This exponential growth in overdose deaths in 2016 didn't extend to all parts of the country. In some states in the western half of the U.S., our data suggests deaths may have leveled off or even declined. According to Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert in heroin use in the United States, this geographic variation may reflect a historical divide in the nation’s heroin market between the powdered heroin generally found east of the Mississippi River and the Mexican black tar heroin found to the west.

This divide may have kept deaths down in the West for now, but according to Dr. Ciccarone, there is little evidence of differences in the severity of opioid addiction or heroin use. If drug traffickers begin to shift production and distribution in the West from black tar to powdered heroin in large quantities, fentanyl will most likely come along with it, and deaths will rise.

First responders are finding that, with fentanyl and carfentanil, the overdoses can be so severe that multiple doses of naloxone — the anti-overdose medication that often goes by the brand name Narcan — are needed to pull people out. In Warren County in Ohio, Doyle Burke, the chief investigator at the county coroner’s office, has been watching the number of drug deaths rise as the effectiveness of Narcan falls. “E.M.S. crews are hitting them with 12, 13, 14 hits of Narcan with no effect,” said Mr. Burke, likening a shot of Narcan to “a squirt gun in a house fire.”

Early data from 2017 suggests that drug overdose deaths will continue to rise this year. It’s the only aspect of American health, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., that is getting significantly worse. Over two million Americans are estimated to be dependent on opioids, and an additional 95 million used prescription painkillers in the past year — more than used tobacco. “This epidemic, it’s got no face,” said Chris Eisele, the president of the Warren County Fire Chiefs’ Association and fire chief of Deerfield Township. The Narcotics Anonymous meetings here are populated by lawyers, accountants, young adults and teenagers who described comfortable middle-class upbringings.

Back in Akron, Mr. Parker has been clean for seven months, though he is still living on the streets. The ground of the park is littered with discarded needles, and many among the homeless here are current or former heroin users. Like most recovering from addiction, Mr. Parker needed several tries to get clean — six, by his count. The severity of opioid withdrawal means users rarely get clean unless they are determined and have treatment readily available. “No one wants their family to find them face down with a needle in their arm,” Mr. Parker said. “But no one stops until they’re ready.”

About the data

Our count of drug overdoses for 2016 is an estimate. A precise number of drug overdose deaths will not be available until December.

As the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics at the C.D.C., Robert Anderson oversees the collection and codification of the nation’s mortality data. He noted that toxicology results, which are necessary to assign a cause of death, can take three to six months or longer. “It’s frustrating, because we really do want to track this stuff,” he said, describing how timely data on cause of death would let public health workers allocate resources in the right places.

To come up with our count, we contacted state health departments in all 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, asking for their statistics on drug overdose deaths among residents. In states that didn't have numbers available, we turned to county medical examiners and coroners’ offices. In some cases, partial results were extrapolated through the end of the year to get estimates for 2016.

While noting the difficulty of making predictions, Mr. Anderson reviewed The Times’s estimates and said they seemed reasonable. The overdose death rate reported by the N.C.H.S. provisional estimates for the first half of 2016 would imply a total of 59,779 overdose deaths, if the death rate remains flat through the second half of the year. Based on our reporting, we believe this rate increased.

While the process in each state varies slightly, death certificates are usually first filled out by a coroner, medical examiner or attending physician. These death certificates are then collected by state health departments and sent to the N.C.H.S., which assigns what’s called an ICD-10 code to each death. This code specifies the underlying cause of death, and it’s what determines whether a death is classified as a drug overdose.

Sometimes, the cases are straightforward; other times, it’s not so easy. The people in charge of coding each death — called nosologists — have to differentiate between deaths due to drug overdose and those due to the long-term effects of drug abuse, which get a different code. (There were 2,573 such deaths in 2015.) When alcohol and drugs are both present, they must specify which of the two was the underlying cause. If it’s alcohol, it’s not a “drug overdose” under the commonly used definition. Ideally, every medical examiner, coroner and attending physician would fill out death certificates with perfect consistency, but there are often variations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction that can introduce inconsistencies to the data.

These inconsistencies are part of the reason there is a delay in drug death reporting, and among the reasons we can still only estimate the number of drug overdoses in 2016. Since we compiled our data from state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners directly, the deaths have not yet been assigned ICD-10 codes by the N.C.H.S. — that is, the official underlying cause of death has not yet been categorized. In addition, the mortality data in official statistics focuses on deaths among residents. But county coroners typically count up whichever deaths come through their office, regardless of residency. When there were large discrepancies between the 2015 counts from the C.D.C. and the state or county, we used the percent change from 2015 to calculate our 2016 estimate.

We can say with confidence that drug deaths rose a great deal in 2016, but it is hard to say precisely how many died or in which places drug deaths rose most steeply. Because of the delay associated with toxicology reports and inconsistencies in the reported data, our exact estimate — 62,497 total drug overdose deaths — could vary from the true number by several thousand.",Drug Deaths in America Are Rising Faster Than Ever,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html

Historians who have examined many of the documents released this week said they have not found much that would drastically change their understanding of the Kennedy assassination.
But, he said, they underline and expand on the history of that event and that era.","Mr. Sabato had 22 student volunteers combing through the documents this week, searching for more about Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby and many other characters from the drama. “What I’ve learned so far is you can’t understand the Kennedy assassination or the Kennedy presidency or Oswald unless you understand the ’50s and early ’60s,” he said.

The documents were released under a 1992 law requiring all files related to the assassination be made public by Oct. 26, 2017. But after intense, last-minute lobbying by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., President Trump agreed to hold back one last batch pending an additional six-month review to ensure that nothing released would damage national security. Mr. Trump told the agencies that any redactions should be exceedingly rare, given the time elapsed.

“JFK Files are being carefully released,” he wrote on Twitter on Friday. “In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!”

On Friday night, he tweeted that he would “be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,” adding that it would be “to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.”

As a result of his action on Thursday, most of what was posted on the website of the National Archives and Records Administration was not entirely new. Just 53 of the 2,891 documents had never been released before. The rest had previously been released, with some information blacked out, and were made fully public on Thursday.

That means about 3,000 documents remain secret in their entirety, and about 27,000 others remain partly hidden. Under Mr. Trump’s order, those should be released in full by April 26 unless the intelligence agencies make a compelling case to withhold portions of them.

Historians who have examined many of the documents released this week said they have not found much that would drastically change their understanding of the Kennedy assassination. But these files, along with another batch made public in July, reinforce existing narratives, raise further questions or add additional details and context to story lines that were previously part of the record.

In particular, the historians said, the documents help flesh out the backdrop for the shooting that felled the young president in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, and the blizzard of conspiracy theories that followed.

At the center of the superpower standoff was Cuba, then as now a Communist beachhead 90 miles from the United States and an obsession for Kennedy and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Seared by the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs incursion and leery after the nuclear near miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedys spent much of their time in power exploring ways to counter and possibly topple Fidel Castro.

One document included in the July release outlined a proposal to cause food shortages in Cuba as part of Operation Mongoose, the Kennedy administration project to remove Castro from power. The plan called for introducing untraceable biological agents to destroy crops in Cuba, leading to widespread hunger that could set off a revolt against Castro.

According to the memo, Kennedy’s national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, “said that he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear as the result of local Cuban disaffection or of a natural disaster, but that we must avoid external activities such as the release of chemicals, etc., unless they could be completely covered up.” Like many of the plans, there is no evidence that it was ever executed.

The $100,000 plot to assassinate Castro as outlined in the 1964 F.B.I. memo was not a government effort — at least not advertised as such — but an account of meetings supposedly held between Cuban exiles and businessmen with ties to organized crime. There were many assassination plots against Castro in this era, and while people suspected of participating denied involvement when interviewed by the F.B.I., it was noted that Cuban exiles never had a conversation “without someone expressing a desire to kill Fidel Castro.”

The Cuba fixation helps explain the intense interest in Oswald’s trip several weeks before the Kennedy assassination to Mexico City, where he contacted the Cuban Consulate, a longstanding source of curiosity on the part of scholars and theorists. Handwritten notes report a tip that Oswald was accompanied by “El Mexicano,” believed to be Francisco Rodriguez Tamayo, the captain of Cuban Rebel Army 57 until he defected to the United States.

The C.I.A. was so determined to hide the fact that it was wiretapping the Cuban Consulate that it failed to cooperate fully with the Warren Commission that was investigating the assassination. An unsigned handwritten 29-page document, made for a later House select committee, underscored longstanding conclusions that the C.I.A. stonewalled to disguise its surveillance in Mexico City.

“It is indicative of an attitude on the Agency’s part to unilaterally determine the substance of CIA-generated information to be provided to the Warren Commission,” the document said.

Gerald Posner, the author of “Case Closed,” a book that concluded that Oswald really was the lone killer, said the latest documents may not offer any bombshell. But, he said, they underline and expand on the history of that event and that era.

“The focus on what is new in the released files is so intense,” Mr. Posner said, “that sometimes it is possible to miss how richly some of the documents fully develop important themes in assassination history.”","In J.F.K.

Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.

Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy. But for Twitter — influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful — the situation is more vexing. Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.

Many of Twitter’s users have long been frustrated with the site’s scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment. Twitter’s critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.

The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitter’s most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN. Twitter’s guidelines forbid “threats of violence” and “targeted abuse” prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump’s account.

In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the company’s evolving views on hosting the president. That includes allowing tweets under the “newsworthy” label it might otherwise ban. But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting “We need to do better.”

Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump. Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the president’s Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring. “It’s too early to say we’re all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people,” he said.

There are already signs that Twitter’s bottom line is feeling the effects. An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019. Since other parts of social media — most notably Facebook — are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.

“Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities. “If you think about why are people alcoholics, it’s because they don’t acknowledge they’re alcoholics.”

He added about Twitter, “It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.”

Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year. But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.

Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected. Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.

Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week. When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it “inadequate at every level.” He added that Twitter had “failed to understand how serious this issue is.”

On Tuesday, Twitter said it would “dramatically” increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like. Political ads will be specially marked. Mr. Warner called Twitter’s plan “a good first step.”

On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they “attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.”

But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc. The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.

@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state. It billed itself as the “Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans” but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.

“We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird,” said Mr. Leatherwood. “That’s not how you abbreviate Tennessee. Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.”

The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed. “It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments,” Mr. Leatherwood said. “It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.”

Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation. He said others had as well. He never heard back.

After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trump’s firing of F.B.I. director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, “I love my whiteness. And yours.”

@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.

“I can’t tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account,” said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself. “But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.”

Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress. After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, “We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.”

When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background. One of them presented the company’s long-held philosophy: “We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.”","Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia.html

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

It is now being redone by another photographer.

Bulgari, Diesel and Valentino, all brands that recently worked with Mr. Richardson on their ad campaigns, issued statements stating that they had no plans to work with him in the future.

It all sounds very responsible. But some industry insiders have begun to question whether fashion’s efforts to distance itself from Mr. Richardson is an attempt to Band-Aid over a deeper crisis, to make a public example of an offender already accused in order to appear to be taking action, when a much broader and more systemic approach needs to be adopted.

Edie Campbell, a model who has been featured in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, among others, said: “The reality is that the floodgates are already open regarding Terry Richardson. He’s been blacklisted once before, and it’s not that much of an emotional, psychological or commercial leap to blacklist him again. The difficulty is addressing the other people — the ones who are celebrated by the fashion industry, and who are still at the very heart of it. This will not be solved simply by banning the use of one photographer.”

While there are many creative and morally reputable professionals in the industry, it is also rife with reports of lines being crossed.

“The problem is much larger than Terry, who has become the scapegoat, and the quickest means for this industry to absolve itself from any responsibility,” said David Bonnouvrier, the co-founder of DNA Models.

Katie Grand, the editor of Love magazine and a stylist who works with brands including Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu, and who earlier this week reposted a statement from Ms. Campbell on Instagram to the same effect, wrote in an email: “I don’t want to sound like I’m defending him, but I thought it was important to put into perspective that every model has a story of a photographer, client, art director, stylist behaving inappropriately.”

Mr. Richardson was widely pilloried in 2014 when allegations of behavior that included cavorting naked on shoots and forcing his penis on models surfaced in the news media.

Mr. Richardson has not denied his behavior but has always maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, and no criminal charges were ever filed. No major new allegations have appeared since 2014, and he had reportedly gone through therapy. He recently had twins and got married.

Numerous magazines cut ties with Mr. Richardson around 2014, though he had gradually returned to the industry, working with celebrities including Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé as well as magazines and brands.

When Roberta Myers was the editor of Elle (she recently stepped down), she had forbidden the magazine to work with Mr. Richardson, but after Nina Garcia was appointed as Elle’s new editor, he was commissioned to photograph the actress Zoë Kravitz for the January 2018 cover.

After The New York Times published its account detailing allegations of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment and abuse, Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst, and Ms. Garcia decided to cancel the Elle cover photographed by Mr. Richardson and to reshoot it, a Hearst spokeswoman confirmed.

American Vogue stopped working with Mr. Richardson in 2010, when the first public statements about his behavior appeared, but in the last two years he had done shoots for Vogue China, Vogue France, Korean W, German GQ and Italian GQ, among others. Recently he shot a story for the November issue of W, a Condé Nast magazine, for the first time since 2011. (Mr. Richardson’s photographs have also appeared in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, but not since 2012.)

A Condé Nast spokeswoman said that Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W, was not available for comment. But according to a person familiar with the shoot who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the magazine had decided it was time to give Mr. Richardson another chance. Editors were on set during the shoot and also handled the model casting.

In the wake of the current revelations about the behavior of men in power, including Bill O’Reilly and Leon Weiseltier, however, Mr. Richardson’s past behavior once again made news. The Sunday Times of London revisited the story (the day before Condé Nast International sent its memo). A petition was started on Change.org asking magazines and other brands to stop using Mr. Richardson; it has over 42,000 signatures.

The designer Prabal Gurung posted on Instagram: “It is important that we hold everyone accountable who worked with Terry Richardson. Not to shame them, but to understand the intention & motive behind their decision to turn a blind eye to his horrific actions. Clearly they cannot say they didn’t know, because we all knew.”

The question now becomes: What else does fashion know?

Trish Goff, a former top model who has spoken about her experience with Mr. Weinstein, said that during her modeling years, “there were other girls and agents who would warn you about a photographer. They’d say, ‘Be mindful of him,’ or “Don’t let him convince you to take off your clothes.’”

Athena Currey, who modeled from 1993 to 2008, said that when she was a 19-year-old working in Paris, her agency sent her on a shoot with a photographer who called her later that night at her hostel to describe how much he wanted to “make love to me.” The next day, she told her agent, a woman, that the conversation made her very uncomfortable and that she did not want to work with him again.

“Everyone said, ‘Of course, of course,’” Ms. Currey said now. “Then a week later, my agent called me and said: ‘I have a really important job, and I really think you should do it. Only it’s with that photographer.’ And then she put a huge amount of pressure on me to get over it and do the job. And I know they sent other girls to him afterward.” The agency, which was a minor presence in the industry, appears to have closed.

None of the models who discussed their experiences for this article said their agents ever talked to them about how to handle unwanted advances from photographers, even if they knew their clients were likely to encounter them.

Carolyn Kramer, a former co-director of Marilyn Models and a former casting director at Self magazine who currently owns an art gallery in Provincetown, Mass., said: “It all came back to the money. If an agency sees potential in a 15-year-old girl, then it doesn’t matter to them what may be happening behind the scenes if the girl can get a campaign. I give myself a C- for what I was able to accomplish to protect my girls. We all sold our souls to the devil so the model could become famous.”

Amber Valletta, a model, actress and activist, said she was asked to take her top off during her first modeling summer in Italy when she was 15 and, on another occasion, was asked by a model booker at a magazine to disrobe. When Ms. Valletta was 18 or 19, she said, a photographer came to her hotel room, asked to give her a massage and began rubbing her breasts.

She said she thought the most important next step was putting structures in place throughout the industry to protect all involved, from garment workers to models.

“My experiences were so minor compared to stories I have heard,” she said. “You start taking one person down, and the skies are going to fall.”

Condé Nast is aware of the risk. On Thursday, in a email to internal management as well as outside contractors, Bob Sauerberg, the chief executive of Condé Nast, and Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman, wrote:

“All employees, freelancers and independent contractors must understand the company’s expectations of appropriate behavior and treatment of others. Condé Nast also expects the agencies that represent hired talent to develop, circulate and reinforce with their clients what is and is not acceptable behavior in interacting with others, with particular emphasis on protecting people who are in vulnerable positions in their professional relationships.”

Ms. Kramer said, “Terry Richardson is just the tip of the iceberg. If magazines distanced themselves from everybody that has been implicated in this kind of behavior, there would be a lot fewer contributing photographers” in their pages.",‘Terry Richardson Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/terry-richardson-sexual-harassment-fashion-photographers.html

In an odd way, Mr. Herrin’s hilarious work on the recent production of “Noises Off” at the Roundabout Theater was excellent preparation. “People, Places & Things” is a kind of inverted farce, with all the doors slamming in the other direction.

But I kept waiting for something bigger than fine stagecraft — and even Ms. Gough’s extreme, ingenious performance — to kick in. In his touching play “Every Brilliant Thing” and in the brutal adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984” he wrote with Robert Icke, Mr. Macmillan demonstrated an eagerness to keep the audience engaged in static stories at all costs, and to send it off with a big finish.

These are usually admirable instincts, and they do, for the most part, keep us from wandering as Emma goes through her recovery laps. Even during the play’s longueurs — it feels a bit padded to achieve its length — you sense that larger questions are being assembled to deliver a gut-punch reversal at the end. When it comes, you must re-evaluate what you thought you knew. But Ben Brantley was right to ask, in his New York Times review of the play’s 2015 premiere at London’s National Theater, whether that effect is “enough to make theatergoers feel that their own long, often tedious path to enlightenment has been worth it.”

His answer was no. Mine is “yes, but.” However valuable and accurate “People, Places & Things” is as a portrait of the addict’s nightmare, in and out of rehab, the play really wants to weigh in on a more fundamental issue about addiction and responsibility. And on this note it seems to waffle as much as I do in responding to it. Perhaps this is the result of a contradiction built into recovery itself, at least as structured along the 12-step model: We play a large part in our own addictions yet we are powerless over them.

Mr. Macmillan develops the argument between these two ideas in a series of confrontations with three women: the recovery center’s doctor; its therapist; and, eventually, Emma’s mother. (It is thematically useful that all are played by Barbara Marten, who is brisk as the doctor, warm as the therapist and jaw dropping as the mother.) The first two women, as advocates for a process that is fundamentally structured around acceptance of a higher power, locate the source of addiction in a breach of humility: Addiction, the doctor suggests, is caused by trauma we flatter ourselves to think we can ignore or control.

Emma furiously rejects this interpretation, in ways that many an atheist and Foucaultian will recognize. “If it’s vital to my recovery that I come to believe in a power greater than me,” Emma fulminates, “then we might all just be wasting our time.” It is, she points out, the 21st century.

And though the doctor explains that her clinic employs a “religiously neutral” modification of the 12-step template — one in which addicts express powerlessness over the three nouns that make up the play’s title — she nevertheless (Emma notices witheringly) wears a crucifix. Further, the play is all too successful in replicating the sententiousness and sanctimony of recovery jargon, at least as overheard by an outsider.

So which is it? Is recovery (as Emma first sees it) a cult of ego deflation or (as she later sees it) a spiritual and medical response to trauma? It may be reasonable to suggest that, as she recovers, her position gradually changes, her punctured actorly narcissism fizzling with a long hiss. She leaves rehab a convert to its philosophy of personal responsibility. But then, as the play closes — I won’t spoil how — we are given devastating evidence that Emma’s addiction is not her fault at all, but rather the mark of the world’s cruelty to sensitive souls.

Are we not then all addicts? Or is the play simply addicted to its own effects?

If I was troubled by Mr. Macmillan’s philosophical opportunism — the story sometimes works like a toggle switch, flipped this way and that to maintain suspense — perhaps it’s because I am leery of a mechanistic approach to “issue drama.” And to recovery. Yet it is not the playwright’s job to provide answers to such questions. It is enough that he leaves you scraping the insides of your soul, looking for your own.","Review: The Horror Show of Rehab in ‘People, Places & Things’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/theater/people-places-things-review.html

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

MANY OF US, let’s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that’s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev’s apartment is certainly photogenic — he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed — but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom — “it’s not like a website where you go and see pictures,” he says. “It’s honest.”

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html

Helsinki’s Best Public Saunas: A Guide

Finnish culture revolves around the sauna. Historically, saunas were where Finns brewed their beer, washed their laundry and cured their hams; where babies were born, the sick were healed and the dead were prepared for burial.

Today, Finland has more than three million saunas for its 5.5 million people — and the sauna is where all serious conversations about work, sex, relationships, politics and faith take place. “Finnish people are bit shy in general, but somehow open up at a sauna when surrounded by strangers,” says Tanja Aromaki, general manager of the Lonna spa, which runs during the summer on Lonna Island, just off the Helsinki mainland.

As the cold months draw near, here are some of the capital’s best public options for stripping down and sweating like a local.

Sauna Arla

As Finnish people moved from rural forested areas into the city during the industrialization of the 1920s and 1930s, few apartments had hot water or showers, so people bathed at public saunas. Although this trend has reversed — almost every building now has its own sauna facilities — there are a handful of public saunas from the era still operating, and gas-and-wood-fired Sauna Arla , established in 1929 and offering massage, cupping and backwashing, is one of the city’s most iconic.

“In the sauna there is strange peace in its darkness and warmness,” says the spot’s owner-manager, Kimmo Helisto. “You don’t need to talk too much — you can face yourself and think about your own things.”

Kaurilan Sauna

Another of Helsinki’s wood-stove saunas, Kaurilan , operates in a 19th-century log cabin. It was originally located in nearby Tuusula but was moved to the leafy Old Meilahti neighborhood in 1995. Its owner, Saara Lehtonen, who makes her own sauna linens and organic cosmetics in an adjacent workshop, says she has seen a recent uptick in Finns seeking the social and spiritual aspect of the shared sauna experience. “Public saunas have always been a place where your status has no meaning and everyone is welcome to relax and enjoy the beautiful, unique and sacred atmosphere a sauna can offer,” she says.

Loyly

“Key things for a good sauna are that it’s wood heated, it has a big enough stove and it has enough fresh air,” says Eemeli Nurminen, general manager of the sleek, architecturally striking Loyly , named for the untranslatable Finnish word which encapsulates the sound, heat and moisture of splashing water on a hot stove. Owned by the Finnish TV star Jasper Paakkonen and member of parliament Antero Vartia, it offers coed steam and smoke saunas heated by 7,000-kg stoves. Since it opened in May 2016, it has become a popular day-into-night hangout — you’ll often spot Finnish notables at the bar and on the breezy terrace.

Finnish Sauna Society

The Finnish Sauna Society was established in 1937 to foster the heritage and health benefits of the national bath. Today, its oceanfront clubhouse offers six wood-fired saunas and four savusaunas (smoke saunas) for its 4,200 members and their guests, plus personal washing and massage services. The society awards grants to members keen to undertake sauna-related studies and its regular seminars are a great introduction to sauna culture — including lessons on the mythology surrounding sauna elves, gnomes and trolls who enjoy the last of the steam once the humans have gone.

Sauna Hermanni

Located in its eponymous neighborhood, Sauna Hermanni opened to serve the surrounding apartments in 1953. Its owner, Mika Ahonen, strives to maintain the aesthetic of that time — there are retro wood-paneled sauna walls and locker rooms displaying contemporary photos and magazines and hosting regular D.J. nights, poetry readings and barbecues. Pass by and you’ll find visitors of all ages cooling off outside with a lemonade and a herring sandwich, even in the dead of winter. “Most people comes after work or study and stay two to three hours,” Ahonen says. “They can hang around as long they want; we don’t have time limits.”

Kotiharjun Sauna

Serving patrons since 1928, the family-owned Kotiharjun is one of Helsinki’s longest-running public saunas and one of its most relaxed. There’s no need to book a spot — and you can stay as long as you like. You can also buy your own vihtu (birch switch) with which to whack yourself — it’s supposed to improve circulation — or indulge in a washing experience with massage, reflexology and acupressure. Between steam sessions, saunagoers grab a towel and beer and chill — literally — on the street outside.

Uunisaari

Tiny beach-ringed Uunisaari Island, a two-minute ferry ride from Helsinki pier, has a nostalgia-tinged, Old World holiday feel that speaks to its long history as an urban escape. “Even in the 19th century, Uunisaari had a famous seaside bathhouse,” says its head of operations, Outi Gummerus. While red-brick Restaurant Ugn and the island’s barbecue spots and beaches are open to the public year-round, its two upscale wood-shack saunas and outdoor whirlpool are only for exclusive use, except on Sundays, when you can purchase a public ticket and relax on the terrace between sessions with harbor views, cocktails and live music.

Kulttuurisauna

Established in 2013 by the designer Nene Tsuboi and the architect Tuomas Toivonen to enhance the city’s public bath options, this wood-heated sauna takes its stylistic cues from the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who was also a sauna fan. Quite a few rules are upheld to retain the sauna’s sense of sanctuary: no reservations, no private parties, no groups, no alcoholic drinks and no swimwear — Finns don’t want swimming-pool chlorine vaporizing in the heat — although you’re welcome to don a suit when mingling on the harborfacing coed deck.

Saunas at Yrjonkatu Swimming Hall

When it opened in 1928, Yrjonkatu was Finland’s only public swimming hall — and remained so for several decades. Now, the grand building — reopened following an extensive two-year renovation in 1999 — speaks to the classic architecture of the time. In addition to a 25-meter lap pool, Yrjonkatu offers multiple electric wood-heated public and private, single gender and coed saunas over several floors. 011-358-9-310-87401

Gregory Porter, ‘Nature Boy’

Gregory Porter’s new album “Nat King Cole and Me” pays tribute to one of his strongest influences. With its hearth-like comforts and flawless elocution, Cole’s voice is almost quintessentially dated. But Mr. Porter manages to embody some of the same principles — poise, savvy, listener validation — while punching it up with some contemporary solemnity and world-weariness. On “Nature Boy,” Cole’s signature song, the swarming and enchanting string arrangements of Vince Mendoza echo those on the original 1948 recording, though they’re more abundant. After a climactic interlude, Mr. Porter repeats the song’s famous catch phrase one last time, his voice now measured and low: “The greatest thing you’ll ever learn/Is just to love and be loved in return.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Brian Eno and Kevin Shields, ‘Only Once Away My Son’

How did this team-up take so long to happen? Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and the producer-songwriter-conceptualist Brian Eno both cherish the resonant, the amorphous, the unmoored, the immersive, the destabilizing. “Only Once Away My Son,” an instrumental, has a deceptive opening, with an urgent drum-and-cymbal beat that soon evaporates. The rest blends tinkly bell tones and almost subliminally soothing low notes with what must be Mr. Shields’s swaths of hovering tremolo guitar: freneticism that begins on a far horizon, draws close and lingers, menacingly, before finding what sounds more like respite than resolution.

Clean Bandit Featuring Julia Michaels, ‘I Miss You’

Sometimes Julia Michaels sings like she’s choking on the words, as if she’s turning away from them as soon as they escape from her mouth. On “I Miss You,” an affecting collaboration with the austere British dance-pop outfit Clean Bandit, she’s at her most forlorn: “You weren’t a fan of pictures, so I hardly ever took ‘em/Got ‘em saved in my mind from the bedroom/So that way I can’t forget your skin.” JON CARAMANICA

Rhye, ‘Taste’

The elusive R&B group Rhye , led by the singer Milosh, reappears with the insinuating “Taste,” a bedroom whisper — “I’m not awake, I’m not alone” — delivered in a perfectly androgynous falsetto. It’s got a subdued funk pulse hinting at Sly and the Family Stone’s “Family Affair,” interlaced with burbling chamber-pop woodwinds; it never gets anywhere near too pushy. J.P.

The Weather Station, ‘You and I (on the Other Side of the World)’

Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian songwriter who leads the Weather Station, sings as if she’s spent a lot of time pondering her way toward complicated conclusions. “You and I (on the Other Side of the World)” is a folk-rock meditation exploring the mysteries of an enduring marriage: “More intimate than I could imagine/But with space I cannot fathom.” The music harks back to the late 1960s, mostly clinging to two chords as string arrangements rise and subside in the background, mirroring hopes and uncertainties. J.P.

Snoh Aalegra Featuring Logic, ‘Sometimes’

The slow-and-low hip-hop-soul saunter of 1995-97 finds new life in “Sometimes,” one of the standout songs from the impressive new Snoh Aalegra album “FEELS.” On this song, she floats somewhere between neo-soul — its original incarnation — and trip-hop, singing breathily and with purpose. A slickly sneering verse from Logic adds acid and bite. J.C.

Sleigh Bells, ‘And Saints’

So long, power chords. “And Saints,” from a coming EP titled “Kid Kruschev,” sets aside Sleigh Bells’ usual drums-and-guitar bravado for a different minimal configuration: just motoric bass notes and high, filmy synthesizer tones enfolding Alexis Krauss’s distraught voice and elusive tidings: “Temple throb, dust lakes/Black gold, tigers and saints.” Whatever she's going through is more than a headache. J.P.

Kap G Featuring Lil Baby, ‘Pull Up’

Kap G is one of hip-hop’s underrated melodists. He sing-raps with a slur, leaving his vocals round and a little fuzzy. “Pull Up” plays to his strengths — he sounds woozy, sweet, a little distant, easing between tight clusters of words and dreamy smeared syllables. Behind him, the beat — produced by Young TT & Squat Beats — tinkles and creeps while Kap G elegantly swerves. J.C.

John McNeil and Mike Fahie, ‘Can Do’

Here’s an item on the list of “things we don’t see a lot of anymore” in jazz: a close rapport between two musicians, forged on the jam session stage, week after week over a series of years. But that’s what John McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mike Fahie, a trombonist, have developed. They spent roughly a decade leading sessions at watering holes around New York, mentoring younger musicians and deepening a repertoire. Still, for their debut album together, “Plainsong,” they’ve put the focus on their original compositions, not standard fare. The tunes are harmonically snaked and rhythmically relentless; they highlight the horn players’ teasing interplay, and keep the stellar rhythm section — the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Billy Hart — on the move. Mr. McNeil and Mr. Fahie wrote the uptempo “Can Do” together, and it’s a highlight. G.R.

To walk through Midland Beach is to hear the chugging and whining of backhoes and power tools and the pounding of hammers as contractors rebuild.

But relatives of those who died described gaps in their own reckoning with loss. Some remain haunted by what they imagine about the end. Others still feel an uncomfortable frustration toward their loved one who died — why didn’t he evacuate? Or why did she wait until the last moment?

Walter Colborne, the 89-year-old father, and his wife, Marie Colborne, 66, were active retirees in the Great Kills neighborhood, traveling on cruise ships and taking regular outings in their yacht they kept at a dock near their home. Mrs. Colborne, like her husband, had been married before, and with that in mind, they named the yacht “One More Time.” They once spent a month navigating the Atlantic to visit children in Florida, and another month coming home.

Mr. Colborne was a World War II veteran who had fought in Europe. He was fearless, said his daughter, Christine Colborne, 64, of Fort Myers, Fla. Their children were concerned, but not surprised, when the couple said they were riding out Sandy in their apartment.

“I told her to get the hell out,” said Mrs. Colborne’s daughter from a prior marriage, Jeanne Mikkelsen, 52, also of Fort Myers. “She said, ‘No, we’re staying upstairs.’ Well, they didn’t stay upstairs.’”

The storm arrived on Oct. 29, 2012. The Colbornes’ children called and called. No answer. Mr. Colborne’s granddaughter, Debra Drancsak Cooper, 54, urged others to stay calm. “I said, ‘Mom, they had a hurricane. The cells are down.” She is from Gretna, La., and like her aunts in Florida, knew what a passing storm could do to communications. But then another day passed.

“Halloween night is when we really started thinking about it,” Ms. Cooper said.

The police, firefighters and paramedics searched on Staten Island for survivors. But it was a civilian who, looking behind a boat in a wooded lot, found the two bodies.

“We think they probably panicked in the end,” said Christine Colborne. “There was water and sand in their condo. They panicked and tried to go.”

Even that still doesn’t sound quite right; Mr. Colborne wasn’t prone to panic. Their children wonder if he had some sort of medical emergency that forced them to seek help. Their car was near the bodies, keys in the ignition and a few thousand dollars and some clothes stashed inside.

“We still want to think in our minds that they were together, holding hands,” Ms. Cooper said. “Which they were not.”

At their funeral, another couple said they had seen the Colbornes drive away from the apartment as they were doing the same thing, but they turned in different directions when exiting the complex, one couple toward safety and the other, death.

“I obsessed over my father in this cold black water, wondering what his final thoughts were,” said Christine Colborne. “It killed me.”

A few miles away, a 79-year-old widow and mother of six, Beatrice Spagnuolo, was in her small home on Grimsby Street in Midland Beach as the storm approached. She had survived colon cancer, but she was frail. Her next-door neighbor was her best friend, practically family.

When she was raising her children, Ms. Spagnuolo had preached the importance of solid civil-service jobs, and they listened. She would come to count among them a police officer, a subway motorman, a construction foreman and a sanitation worker.

One of her daughters, a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, was asleep on her couch as the storm approached. Ms. Spagnuolo’s house was on her regular route.

Her son Vincent called. “I said, ‘You’ve got to get the hell out of there — get your stuff and go,’” he said. “The water was coming up to her knees.”

She obeyed. Her daughter helped her into their car and was pulling away from the house. Then the mother told her to stop.

“Let me go get my pills,” she told her daughter. She went back inside.

A huge wave struck the block. “All the lights went black,” Mr. Spagnuolo said, repeating what his sister later told the family. “There were wires from the telephone pole, electrocuting. Sparks.”

When the waters receded, Ms. Spagnuolo’s body was found in the house. Next door, her old friend, Anastasia Rispoli, 73, was dead, too.

Photo

Halloween was the next day. Mr. Spagnuolo, who lived in Brooklyn, had a young daughter who had expected to go trick-or-treating. “She was crying,” Mr. Spagnuolo recalled. “So I took her around the corner. I had to put on a happy attitude for her. It was terrible.”

The death of Ms. Spagnuolo affected her children in different ways. Some have become more reclusive, skipping family gatherings at Christmas and other holidays. Most of them, like Mr. Spagnuolo, cannot visit the block of Grimsby where she lived. He lights a candle at Mass for his mother, who was a regular at church.

“You relive it,” he said. “Every year they have, like, a walk down by the beach there. They play a bagpiper. It’s tough to go. Something you don’t get over, the way she died.”

The house, unsafe, was razed. The lot remains empty. Someone else delivers mail on the block — not Ms. Spagnuolo’s daughter, who, like her brother in sanitation, can’t go back. Not for work, not for anything.

In the case of the Colbornes, it was Mrs. Colborne’s daughter, Ms. Mikkelsen, who settled their affairs on Staten Island, where she grew up and couldn’t get away from fast enough after college. But a string of fluke accidents — a bad pipe, a neighbor’s leak — has delayed the sale of their home and kept her reluctantly coming back up from Florida for weeks at a time.

“It’s almost like somebody up above doesn’t want me to move on,” she said.

Finally, this summer brought interest from a buyer.

“I went in, I said goodbye to the apartment, and I don’t ever plan on going back there again,” she said. “Staten Island represents the death of my mother.”

In her darkest times, she forced herself to think about other victims. A mother lost two sons, ages 2 and 4, when waves swept them from her arms on Staten Island. That mother, like others, declined to speak last week. Ms. Mikkelsen has never met her.

Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for. I’m afraid you’d better bite down and pay up.",My Wife Found My Sexy Phone Pics and Won’t Let It Go,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/my-wife-found-my-sexy-phone-pics-and-wont-let-it-go.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

He had cleaned other people’s clothes since immigrating to the United States as a boy in the 1930s from Sunwei, in the southern coastal province of Guangdong, working in the laundry 16 hours a day six days a week while her mother, the former Hop Kun Leo, who was also from Sunwei, ran their modest home.

In “Parents,” Ms. Chiang wrote about her father:

hey! That dude was some snappy dresser.

during the war, they let him work

the navy yards as an apprentice steelwelder

but when the soldiers came home

laundry customers called him Charlie.

(“Charlie” was almost certainly a reference to the fictional detective Charlie Chan, who was considered by many a racist Chinese stereotype.)

Fay Ping Chiang was born in the Bronx on Jan. 27, 1952. While attending Hunter College in Manhattan, she became active in the movement against the Vietnam War and worked with student groups to establish Asian-American studies courses and programs at Hunter and other colleges in the City University of New York system.

But she left college; as the eldest daughter, she was expected to care for her father, who was dying of cancer, and run the laundry. She eventually graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan with a degree in illustration.

In the mid-1970s, Ms. Chiang took the first of what would be a series of jobs with nonprofit groups when she became executive director of the Basement Workshop in Chinatown, a social and cultural organization that mainly served the Asian-American arts community.

“She was a steadfast believer that cultural and educational work was the key to activism,” John Kuo Wei Tchen, a historian at New York University and founding director of the university’s Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute, wrote in an email. “She always talked about people needing to realize they had choices and could get unstuck in their lives.”

After a dozen years with the Basement Workshop, Ms. Chiang worked at the Henry Street Settlement’s outreach program; in New York Newsday’s public affairs department; at Project Reach, a youth program based in Chinatown; and Poets & Writers, a readings and workshop program.

In recent years she had painted dozens of portraits of people, many of them youngsters, who were killed by law enforcement.

“I think people need to see the faces of these young people,” Ms. Chiang told the news website DNAinfo in 2015 when she exhibited the portraits at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts on West 39th Street in Manhattan.

In addition to her daughter, Ms. Chiang is survived by her sisters, Jean and Janice Chiang. She never married. Her brother, Peter, died in 1982.

Ms. Chiang documented the toll that metastatic breast cancer had taken on her in “Landmarks and Geography,” a 2012 poem that opens with a list of each surgery and each tumor, node and breast that had been removed from her.

I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.
[ Read our refresher on where “Stranger Things” Season 1 left off. ]","The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first season’s conflicts. Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.

Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will’s D&D buddies — Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) — find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine’s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).

The new season’s biggest strength is how it deals with Will’s trauma. He’s a frail kid who’s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn’t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show’s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder’s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.

For a breakout hit, “Stranger Things 2” mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show’s teen characters for much of the season), but they’re grounded in the story and characters.

And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown’s transfixing stare, into “The Eleven Show.”

“Stranger Things” has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyce’s amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates. Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though it’s made out of movies. Parts of the new season recall “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Gremlins,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and, naturally, the Reese’s Pieces sequence in “E.T.” For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes “The Outsiders,” complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.

When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there’s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of ’80s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. “No one wants to be Winston!” he says. “He joined the team super late, he’s not funny and he’s not even a scientist.”

The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he’s made up a story. “I really liked it,” she says. “I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.”

That would be a fair critique of “Stranger Things 2,” which reprises many of Season 1’s arcs and twists. (The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by — well, you’ll see.) I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.

But it’s a still a good time, it’s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of ’80s horror with the heart of an ’80s teen romance. It may be last year’s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn’t mean it can’t still be sweet.

If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.","There is plenty of like-minded confabbing — Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress — that makes everybody look right and good. And in “Chicago Stories,” with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets. It’s working. The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing “what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.” You know, on the podcast he controls completely.

Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal. Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners. And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.

But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities. (“Off the Sidelines” from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and “Off the Cuff” from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; “We the Podcast” from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)

All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself. The president doesn’t have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the “Real News Update” hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.

Traditional news media might be politically polarized — watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the day’s events — but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences. Now, you don’t have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through “The Bernie Sanders Show,” in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.

The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven. But that’s not the only thing wrong with it. The podcasts are also boring.

Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them. Mr. Emanuel’s podcast would probably be more captivating if he weren’t so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill. And I’m sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what it’s like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but he’s instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.

None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless you’re a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict. Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: “Maxine and I don’t agree on much of anything,” but “I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.” Hopefully, they’ll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.

Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig. In the first episode of “Canarycast,” Mr. Brown tells his guests — a trio of Whirlpool workers — that he has to end the interview to cast a vote. Ms. Gillibrand’s podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes. I guess she’s been busy.

The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office. These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain. They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign podcast, “With Her,” became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue. Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, “Biden’s Briefing,” which is billed as a “skillcast” for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.

The highlight of the category is “Stay Tuned With Preet,” starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump. Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead he’s teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur, and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.

If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs. For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach. These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us.

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Horseman’s Hollow

(Ages 10 and up, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.)

At 7 p.m. that same Saturday, the line for Horseman’s Hollow was full, and devil horns ($3.95 at the gift shop) glowed red on many a head. Ghosts in tricorn hats chased shrieking SUNY students. A local market sold doughnuts and cider. Inspired by “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Historic Hudson Valley staged Horseman’s Hollow on the grounds of Philipsburg Manor, converting the historical site into a colonial town gone mad. Think fewer clowns, more yellow fever.

I followed a lantern-lit trail along the Pocantico River toward the old manor. Signs along the path warned of the Headless Horseman, but mostly it was just nice to be out of the city.

Decapitations were, fittingly, all the rage in the town. “Let’s see how you laugh without a windpipe,” one lobbed-off head barked through planks of wood.

“Welcome to my garden,” a crone beckoned, and I proceeded cautiously, worried she’d push a farm share.

In a dark barn, ghosts in flowing, glowing sheers oscillated like tower fans. A zombie nun stopped eating a dead soldier’s entrails to scream at me, then the dead soldier popped up to scream as well.

“Oh, God,” I whimpered as I stepped into a foreboding temple.

“You’re right,” a satanic figure atop the throne said. “I am God.”

Winding outdoor paths provided a moment to catch my breath before the next hazy tent or demon’s Airbnb. I paused in the cemetery to let pass a woman who had been loudly telling her friend an unrelated childhood story since we’d left the fortune teller’s camp — what is this, the Moth? Pipe down!

Outside the schoolhouse, Ichabod Crane jumped out. “He’s real!” he cried, pointing.

Looming up ahead, in front of the manor, the Horseman sat ominously on a real horse. “No flash!” a handler snapped at the people in the crowd who had their phones out like Justin Bieber was on that horse and we were all in Montclair, N.J.

Back at the entrance, the ghouls entertained the crowd with a Mad-Libbed shanty, incorporating someone’s oh-so-Hudson-River-Valley suggestion: “401(k).”

Inside, it was loud and hot. For 20 feverish minutes, throughout 18 different rooms, I fended off attacks from an ax-wielding contortionist, an undead stripper dancing across from, well, a dead stripper impaled on her pole, and a doctor who leapt across his operating table toward me, growling, “It’s just you and me, big guy.”

Ever wondered what you’d do if you were kidnapped? I sure haven’t.

From Psycho Clan, the team behind Nightmare New York, This Is Real simulates a group abduction in an isolated Red Hook warehouse. Only eight people are admitted during each time slot, and everyone must sign a waiver beforehand. Because most of the other times were sold out, I was given a 3 p.m. Sunday slot, a good option in case you and your aunt can’t get into “Hello, Dolly!”

I stood outside the warehouse with my fellow abductees: a group of male friends and a guy who’d driven two hours from Connecticut. Threatening greeters circled us, murmuring, “Introduce yourselves. You will need each other.”

Two of my biggest fears were already being engaged: a broken fourth wall and a bunch of straight guys depending on me for their survival.

Inside we were blindfolded, bound at the hands and led one by one into narrow cells. I wriggled free of my bindings and raised my blindfold just in time to watch the stocking-capped killer spray a tied-up woman with a gas that made her woozy. He ran down our row of cells, spraying us as well.

“You’re pretty,” he said to my neighbor, and, to me, “I’m attracted to you.”

“Thank you,” I nearly purred back.

He hauled the woman out, and we had to unlock our cells and scour the filthy, sparse room for ways to escape without getting caught. Every few minutes we heard whistling, which meant the killer was approaching, and scrambled to hide. I wasn’t fast enough the first time.

“Dead!” he shouted, pointing at me, as earsplitting horror movie strings swelled. (Luckily, you get three lives.)

The boys tore through our room while I tried to look busy. “Here,” one of them said to me, “I’ll hoist you up to that electrical box, and see if you can find anything.” I longed for the killer’s whistle.

I survived the 70-minute ordeal, hiding in a refrigerator two rooms back, abandoned by the others. The greeters, no longer threatening, took our photo for the Instagram page and recommended Botanica across the street for a drink.

“It’s not much cooler out there,” a greeter said, pushing the warehouse doors open.

Oh, right — out there. I took a deep breath, steeled myself and stepped back in.

The day before, he’d been a Cubs fan, like all kids who grew up on the north side of Chicago, but had no trouble switching loyalties. “It was baseball and it was Chicago,” he told me. “From that day forward I became a rabid White Sox fan.”

He was small for his age, maybe 5-foot-3, and skinny. The players took to calling him “Kid” or “Red” because of his hair. Before every game he would show up at the park three hours early, hauling out equipment and chopping ice for the water cooler. On occasion, the players would invite him to take part in batting practice. The pitchers would sometimes fool with him, whipping a real fast one over the plate. When he was lucky enough to hit a ball solidly, there was lots of cheering.

In the dugout, Luke Appling, who became a Hall of Famer, always had a mouth full of tobacco. He got a big kick out of spitting on Dad’s shoe. “I was happy to have him do it,” Dad told me.

During the game, Dad knelt on the field 20 feet from home plate and all the heroes who stepped up to it: Williams, DiMaggio, Lou Boudreau. It was important that he not call attention to himself, but once when he didn’t hustle enough to grab a bat, he heard from Yogi Berra, who had just come up to the majors. “Hey kid,” he said, “next time, be sure you get that bat out of there a bit more quickly.”

One of the White Sox’ big hitters, Pat Seerey, thought of my dad as something of a good-luck charm. Before games, while the other players warmed up with each other, Seerey threw the ball back and forth with him. Each time, Seerey would take a step back. By the end Dad could barely get it back to him. “I don’t think I ever threw it away, though.”

My dad was there, in Philadelphia, when Seerey hit four home runs in a single game, joining an exclusive club. My dad is in the newspaper photo, standing at home plate, waiting for Seerey to come in. He wanted to be there to shake his friend’s hand.

Razzing from the dugout was a sport unto itself, and the part my dad probably enjoyed the most, as any 14-year-old boy would. Recalling the players’ shenanigans decades later makes him break into a full laugh. He remembers that every time the short and squat Berra was at bat, one of the Sox pitchers would imitate a monkey, looping his arm over the top of the dugout, scratching himself and ooh-ooh eee-eeeing. Williams once told a reporter that he’d rather be a fireman. So every time he was at bat, one of the Sox would walk back into the dugout tunnel, which served as a megaphone, and make loud siren noises.

DiMaggio, though, was in his own class. He commanded more respect. Whenever he was up, all the players fell silent.

After the games the players would take off their shoes and throw them in a heap. It was dad’s job to polish them up and put them back in the lockers. In those days, the uniforms were wool, and after a game they’d be wet with sweat. There was a huge oven in the clubhouse with a clothesline running through it. Dad would throw the uniforms over the line and dry them out in the oven so they could be worn the next day. After a two- or three-game series, they would be washed. Dad would usually get a ride home from one of the players or sportswriters. He was paid $1 a game. No tips.

Sometimes he had to run errands for the clubhouse manager and get something from the opposing team’s clubhouse. That was my dad’s chance to approach the visiting players — DiMaggio, Williams, Bob Feller — all of whom signed the balls my dad held out for them.

Across the front of one of my dad’s baseballs is neat cursive looping into the name Satchel Paige. It was Paige’s first year in the majors. The Negro Leagues star was one of the first African-Americans to join the American League. The White Sox were still all white.

They were also dead last in the league and usually drew small crowds. But the first night the Indians came to Comiskey Park after signing Paige was different. The entire stadium was full. Thousands were turned away. Dad doesn’t remember any racial taunting, just that so many black Chicagoans had come to see their hero, the 42-year-old rookie. “Satchel pitched a great game too,” he said, a five-hit shutout. (Before the integration of the game, Comiskey was usually where the big event of the Negro Leagues season, the East-West All-Star Game, was played.) The Sox finished the season 46 games behind the Indians, who went on to win the World Series, the last time they did so.

Like some other Russian experts, Stephen Blank, a senior fellow with the nonprofit American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, said they indicate that Ms. Veselnitskaya’s actions “were coordinated from the very top.”

The Trump Tower meeting is of keen interest to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a widespread fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to the Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family, to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last Friday, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of Russian analysts called it inconceivable Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

FRIDAY PUZZLE — David Steinberg has come a long way from his New York Times Crossword debut as a 14-year-old in 2011 (for those of us over the age of 40, that would be last Thursday).

He still has time to create crosswords for The Times, and Mr. Steinberg will be adding an additional crossword to his rotation.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.

We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation’s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin — and the reader — have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel’s narrative like one of Trent Reznor’s dark guitar chords: “Wasn’t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.”

“We can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.”

“Instead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.”

A description of Google’s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: “It was insinuated in every facet of people’s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.” From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there’s nothing to be done about it. It’s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don’t even know that we’re sick.

A similar widespread villainy lies at the heart of David Ignatius’s THE QUANTUM SPY (Norton, $25.95), a somber espionage procedural about the race to build the world’s first quantum computer — a theoretical frontier at the intersection of computer science and quantum physics. Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist who has long covered the C.I.A., and he happily takes us for a jaunt through a world of anonymous hotel rooms and conference tables across Beijing and Vancouver and Dubai, where decisions to take someone off “the shelf” (i.e., bring him or her back into action) are blankly relayed and executed. American start-ups on the brink of game-changing innovation are visited by a C.I.A. officer, a “lean, putty-faced man with a bad haircut” who quietly demands for the United States government to be their only client. Operatives aspire to the “highest art” of their profession: to “appear ordinary.”

Here, the ostensible enemy is a mole inside the C.I.A. known as Rukou, or the Doorway, whom the C.I.A. must ferret out and eliminate, all the while keeping the Chinese away from their technological breakthroughs — a Sisyphean exercise if ever there was one.

The mood is mournful and restrained. The C.I.A.’s vibe feels like a highway motel with thin walls, a smell of chlorine, a vending machine where your Twix gets stuck on the glass. The most delightful aspect of the book is the characterization of the Chinese — their expletive-ridden insults, downbeat perspective (“Bad luck is always hiding inside the doorway, down the next hutong”), and quirks. Chinese agents carry a mijian with them at all times, “a small, leatherbound diary” in which they write things “that were never, ever to be shared.” In one fascinating scene set in Mexico, a Chinese agent with a Spanish accent unnerves the Chinese-American hero, Harris Chang, by unveiling Chang’s own secret political Chinese ancestry to him. It proves to be a surprisingly powerful interrogation technique: “He was uncomfortable. It was as if someone else had taken possession of his life story.”

It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build “one world” — a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook’s hope to “bring the world closer together.” But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang’s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: “He occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.” The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.

In Michelle Richmond’s THE MARRIAGE PACT (Bantam, $27), a different kind of evil is in play, this one just as intangible and pernicious. Giddy and in love, two Bay Area newlyweds, Alice and Jake, receive a Molotov cocktail of a wedding present: an invitation to join “The Pact,” a hush-hush society-cum-cult, the details of which are pitched to them “Glengarry Glen Ross”-style by Vivian, a beautiful woman in a yellow dress with a politician’s pivot and spin.

The Pact is a “fellowship of like-minded individuals” dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is “highly effective, scientifically based.” Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an “impenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.” But Alice and Jake — apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, “Shoot first and ask questions later” — agree to Vivian’s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with “an impressively large stack of profiteroles,” where they chat with women who say things like: “Stupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.”

Jake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: “I would’ve stopped it, Jake. I could’ve saved you. Now it’s too late.”

It’s a fun, can’t-stop-eating-the-potato-chips kind of premise. Jake — a marriage counselor who has little insight into his own relationships — descends into a labyrinth of paranoia and isolation as he investigates the truth behind The Pact, all the while lying to his wife and enduring one level of punishment after the next. (Apparently, when it comes to marital harmony, de Sade was really on to something.) The book is at its strongest when Richmond describes The Pact’s manual in a wickedly deadpan style. It sounds like something between a tutorial for new guards on Rikers Island and MarriageTM by the Mad Hatter: “Failure to provide three or more gifts in a single calendar year should be treated as a Class 5 Felony.” Then there is the Focus Mechanism, one of a range of contraptions designed to help you stay attentive to your significant other (QVC, take note): “The collar circles her neck, extending all the way up to her jawline, where it cups her chin.”

As Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.

In Christopher Swann’s first novel, SHADOW OF THE LIONS (Algonquin, $26.95), we are whisked into another type of cult: Blackburne, an elite all-boys private school in the Virginia countryside, rife with its own odd rituals and unspoken understandings. “A warning shake of the head meant Watch out.” “Cutting your eyes away from a classmate you passed in the hall could be as cruel as sneering in his face.”

Our protagonist is Matthias Glass — a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York’s literary scene with a “long-legged, pouty” model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods — and “off the edge of the earth.” He was never seen again.

Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class “in a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.” Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing — the desire to “conquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,” or how being labeled gay constituted “the worst, most devastating blow” that left the accused “cast into the outer darkness.”

Blackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet’s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: “Doubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.” It’s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.

Danya Kukafka’s bewitching first novel, GIRL IN SNOW (Simon & Schuster, $26), spins a spell of mournful confession around a “Twin Peaks”-like centerpiece, the beautiful girl found dead: “Lucinda Hayes broke her neck. Cracked it on the edge of the carousel.” The truth is revealed through the claustrophobic confessions of three misfits, observations Kukafka gently takes out and holds up to the light as if sifting through a refuse-filled gutter after a rain. There is Russ, the restrained police officer investigating Lucinda’s murder; Jade, a resentful fellow classmate who makes sense of people and events by stuffing them into the skeletal format of a screenplay; and Cameron, the obsessive loner who stalked Lucinda: “Cameron had started playing Statue Nights when he was 12 years old.” In Kukafka’s capable hands, villainy turns out to be everywhere and nowhere, a DNA that could be found under the fingernails of everybody’s hands.

In THE MURDERS OF MOLLY SOUTHBOURNE (Tor/Forge, paper, $11.99), a scold’s bridle of a coming-of-age tale by Tade Thompson, we meet the protagonist of the title agonizing in her “universe defined by pain.” Every time Molly bleeds, the blood gives birth to a dimwitted, monstrous version of herself, a ghoulish other “molly” who, after a period of incubation, blasts out of doors and from under the bed, bloodthirsty and dangerous. Molly must kill these doppelgängers before they kill her. And thus unspools a horrifying childhood. She learns to murder and dispose of human flesh with the precision of a Tarantino fixer (“When her parents arrive she is lying on a pile of corpses she’d been trying to clean”), all the while enjoying the ABCs of adolescence: first kisses, running away from home, Rudyard Kipling.

The most compelling aspects of the book are not just Thompson’s dagger prose (“In these teenage years she kills three mollys a week, sometimes as many as one a day”), but also the blunt paragraphs and truncated chapters through which he reveals Molly’s reality. It has the effect of a slide show in Art History 101. In darkness, we are shown a series of close-ups: gnarled hand, decapitated head, a foot, some blood, fragments that make little sense until the final portrait is revealed. It’s as unsettling as one of Francis Bacon’s screaming popes, or the Lucian Freud painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping”: a bold outpouring of flesh and crisis at once horrifying and familiar.

Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.

The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily — slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted détente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.

We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it’s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn’t good. It seems these days we’re not only uncertain of everything and everyone — foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads — we’re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”

So, pass the matches. It’s going to be a long night.","Our Villains, Ourselves: A Thriller Roundup",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/books/review/matt-richtel-dead-on-arrival-new-thriller-fiction.html

I’ve lived in Paris part time for 20 years, but it took a while before I realized that I’d never heard a French friend say “dinner party.” When an invitation is offered, it goes something like: “Venez dîner à la maison.” And when my friends repeat it in English, they say, “Come home for dinner.” The warmth in these words struck me when I first heard them and set me at ease, dispelling whatever ideas I had about French dinners being stuffy — and I had been sure they would be. The phrase called to mind — of course, even the mundane can sound dramatic in French — lots of laughter, good wine, an evening that unfolds at a leisurely pace and ends late. It was what I wanted my own Parisian dinners at home to be.

Home has always been Saint-Germain-des-Prés, but I’m in a new apartment. We moved earlier this year, and while I’m still feeling my way around it, I already know it’s a wonderful place for entertaining friends. The living and dining areas are one slant-ceilinged space with three small balconies, each with geraniums, that double as wine coolers when the weather is right. In real estate speak, the kitchen is “charming”; in practical terms it’s small and demands neatness. It’s a narrow galley that ends in double doors to another balcony, this one with herbs I can snip.

Over the years, I’ve taken to making dinners on Mondays, the night most French hosts prefer to avoid, because all the outdoor markets and most of the best small food shops are closed that day — it’s impossible to get a morsel of fine cheese on Mondays. But because many restaurants are also closed, it’s a good night to feed the people who often cook for me, my friends who work in food.

I create a menu that can be prepared entirely ahead of time — usually the main course will need to be reheated, and everything will need to be plated, but nothing will keep me in the kitchen long. And while I don’t love the constraint, I love the three or four hours I spend the day before gathering provisions at my neighborhood markets. I know I could buy everything at a supermarket, but there would be no pleasure in it, no chance to chat with Twiggy, the cheesemonger, and catch up on the neighborhood news, and no opportunity to discuss with Serge, the butcher, how I was going to cook my osso buco. Each ingredient has its own story by the time I get it home.

A month or so ago, I made a Monday-night dinner for food-world friends, delighting in discovering that, while they knew of one another, not all of them had met. In addition to my husband, Michael, and me, there were two restaurateurs, Bertrand Auboyneau and Juan Sanchez; one cooking-school owner, Jane Bertch; and one baker, Apollonia Poilâne, who brought loaves of dark bread.

People in the food business are easy to feed: They’re grateful to have someone else in the kitchen and forgiving if things aren’t just so. But even if they’re quick to ignore whatever faux pas I, an American, might make, it’s because I’m an American in their country that I want to get it right. With the exception of the cheese plate, which slips in between the main course and dessert in France (and for which I early on bought a book to teach myself how to cut cheeses into their proper shapes), dinner runs pretty much the same way in both countries. Yet it can be like those cognates you learn in a foreign language — the words sound similar to those we know, but they turn out to have different meanings.

There was the time I served fried chicken and couldn’t get anyone to pick it up with their hands — for the most part, the French are not finger-lickers. The time all the cheese I served with drinks was left uneaten — cheese is for the cheese course, not for a nibble. The time I put everything out on the table at once, calling it an indoor picnic, and my guests, although urged to mix and match, reorganized my mishmash into a well-ordered traditional French meal and ate one dish at a time, leaving the salad for last, as is done.

Although I now know what’s accepted and acceptable, I occasionally veer off course and always stray at the beginning of the evening. On this Monday, friends began arriving at about 8, late-ish by American standards and just a bit on the early side by French ones. Dinner always starts in the living room and usually at least a quarter-hour after the time you’ve asked people to come (it’s considered impolite to arrive on time, as it’s assumed that the host always needs a few more minutes). I had everything for l’heure de l’apéro, or cocktail hour, set out on the small table in front of the sofa, and I opened the first bottle of white wine as people got settled. Bertrand took off his jacket — dinner at our home is never dressy — Jane found an armchair and was talking bread with Michael, a home baker, and Juan began pouring. Apollonia arrived a little later, and I put her rye bread next to the gravlax and dill yogurt I had made a few days before. The evening had begun and, within minutes, I heard my favorite sound: the chime of glasses touching in a toast.

Custom would have had me serving the wine with insubstantial tidbits — usually nuts, olives, salty crackers and, inexplicably, cherry tomatoes in any season. But because dinner starts late, and this introductory moment lasts one hour — you can set your clock by it — I’d made the gravlax, passing the first round and then encouraging everyone to help themselves.

We eventually drifted to the table, set with wine- and water glasses, carafes, colorful pottery plates Michael and I carried back from a vacation in the South of France and odd dishes and silver we found at flea markets. I had flowers and candles, but no tablecloth or bread plates — I love the way the French put their bread directly on the table, the inevitable crumbs forming hieroglyphs of collective celebration.

The appearance of the roasted peppers, brushed with oil and sherry vinegar and sitting on ricotta mixed with lemon and herbs, sparked a conversation about gardens. Bertrand had planted a vegetable garden, a potager, in Normandy to supply his Paris restaurants, and Juan had plans to plant one in Champagne. Once the dish was finished, Bertrand briefly turned on his phone (sheepishly asking permission first), and pictures of tomatoes and peppers and chard, leeks, potatoes, eggplants and small zucchini with beautiful oversize yellow blossoms were passed around.

Then came the osso buco, which I arranged in shallow bowls in the kitchen, placing each round of meat over a squash purée and putting only the gremolata on the table (to ensure that I wouldn’t have a repeat of the picnic experience). For a few moments there was silence punctuated by mmmms, the best compliment in any language. Then there were questions about how long I cooked the meat (about 90 minutes), comments about the addition of orange in the sauce (noticeable, but not overly so) and praise for the unusual addition of olives (and the fact that they were oil-cured). The cheese plate, always appreciated but not usually talked about (praise is reserved only for things homemade), followed and was talked about, as the Lou Poutou, a soft cow’s-milk cheese from southwestern France, was new to Jane and Bertrand. As I was clearing the dishes, Michael noticed that it was 11 o’clock, and so we refilled our wineglasses and went onto the balcony to see the Eiffel Tower sparkle — an interlude that might just become a ritual.

Table Talk Asking questions can get a guest to reveal something fascinating about herself. But a quick way to prevent that is to give her possible answers. “Why did you quit law school — was it too boring?” Leave out the guess. A short question is more likely to provoke details.

These dinners at home are not really about the food. They’re about friendship and the conversation that goes on around the table, often late into the night. Yet so much of the talk is about food — the food we’re sharing, the meals we remember, the ones we’ll soon eat, the food we’ve cooked and what we want to cook. New restaurants. New chefs. Has anyone tried the Italian stall at the market? Is bread getting better or worse in the city? Of course, there’s also talk of politics: Will Paris’s mayor really ban cars? What will Macron do? And Trump? “Oh, let’s talk about dessert,” someone says, and we do.

I had made wine-poached pears spiced with cinnamon, cloves and star anise and a cookie with Italian roots, called a torta sbrisolona. The cookie, an eight-inch square, is a communal offering — each person reaches in and breaks off a piece. It was past midnight when I noticed that the candles had burned to stubs. I didn’t turn up the lights — the coziness was too nice. We all had our elbows on the table amid the scattering of crumbs. We bent in, listening closely, and poured one another more wine.

Newspaper articles detailed the killing effects of Soviet nuclear weapons. Children learned to “duck and cover” in schools. Homeowners built shelters in basements and backyards, and the morality of private shelters accessible to privileged families became a raging national debate.

On television, “The Twilight Zone” depicted friends and neighbors in fear of an imminent nuclear attack fighting over access to one family’s shelter. A Life magazine cover featured the alarming image of a man in a “civilian fallout suit” and the headline “How You Can Survive Fallout: 97 of 100 People Can Be Saved.” The government issued a 46-page pamphlet, “Fallout Protection: What to Know and Do About Nuclear Attack.”

President John F. Kennedy’s public fallout shelter program was intended to ease the nation’s anxieties, but its very announcement terrified many Americans. “We have another sober responsibility,” the president told the nation on July 25, 1961, “to recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age, without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if the bombs begin to fall.”

Photo

The program began with a nationwide survey by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify shelter sites. But signs for the public to find the sites apparently occurred to no one at the White House, the Pentagon or the Corps of Engineers. Almost as an afterthought, Maj. Gen. Keith R. Barney, the deputy chief of engineers, posed the matter to Mr. Blakeley, the director of administrative logistics support function.

In plainer language, Mr. Blakeley was one of those important but anonymous civil servants down the chain of command where the buck really stops. He had been a civilian manager for the corps for five years, in charge of administrative work for some 60 harbor, river and other military construction projects.

And in a lifetime of memorable experiences — he was a combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War, and would eventually meet Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter in the course of his duties and become president of Toastmasters International — the shelter signs seemed, as he put it, “no big deal.”

“Like so many other things in life, you solve a problem and go on to the next thing,” he said in a telephone interview for this obituary from his home in Jacksonville in 2014. “I must have just wiped it out of my mind.”

Robert Wilson Blakeley was born in Ogden, Utah, on Aug. 30, 1922, one of four children of Robert G. and Elsie Jean Wilson Blakeley. He attended public schools and Weber Junior College (now Weber State University) in Ogden, and studied for a year at Utah State University.

He joined the Marine Corps in 1943 and was a sergeant major in the Fourth Marine Division invasion of Iwo Jima in 1945, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. He was recalled to duty in the Korean War in 1951 and 1952.

His first marriage, to Jean Brown in the 1940s, ended in divorce. In 1952 he married Dorothy McArthur. She died in 1992. Besides their daughter, Dorothy, they had a son, Robert, who died at age 36. In 2003, he married Irene Allan Davis. In addition to her and his daughter, Mr. Blakeley is survived by three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Mr. Blakeley studied landscape architecture at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1954. After two years with the Veterans Administration, he joined the Army Corps of Engineers in 1956. To improve his speaking, he joined Toastmasters in 1958. He became its international president for 1976-77.

Given responsibility for the fallout shelter project, he decided that for durability, the signs would be made of metal, and that the colors and design would be simple and eye-catching, even in the dark chaos of a city under attack.

“It would have to be usable in downtown New York City, Manhattan, when all the lights are out and people are on the street and don’t know where to go,” Mr. Blakeley told Bill Geerhart, a blogger on Cold War topics, for an oral history that appeared on the website Conelrad Adjacent in 2006. The sign, he said, “had to be something that would get people’s attention and give them direction to the location.”

After experimenting with reflective paint in the basement of his Virginia home, he chose orange-yellow and black for the primary colors, and drew the sign as his children watched over his shoulder. The graphic design was suggested by Blair Inc., of Fairfax, Va., and was probably inspired by “Hornung’s Handbook of Designs and Devices,” published in 1932 and updated in 1946.

What he came up with entailed three bright, inverted equilateral triangles joined at the center on a round black background, with shelter capacity circled near the base, followed by the words “Fallout Shelter” in large block capitals and directional arrows .

The details were approved by Powell Pierpoint, special assistant to the secretary of the Army. Mr. Blakeley recommended that the Army accept bids by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, for 400,000 large exterior signs, and Alfray Products of Coshocton, Ohio, for a million smaller interior signs. The total cost was $700,000.

They were put into production, and Mr. Blakeley unveiled the first prototype (capacity 1,730) at the Westchester County Office Building in White Plains on Oct. 4, 1961. Over decades, the signs proliferated as commercial and apartment buildings joined government sites as shelters — 230,000 sites in New York City alone, civil defense officials estimated.

And as the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam War and the buildup of nuclear arsenals raised the stakes, the Blakeley signs became counterculture icons of the Cold War, mock symbols of apocalypse bobbing in antiwar protests, featured in films and television dramas and plastered on campaign buttons, refrigerator magnets and album covers, like Bob Dylan’s 1965 classic “Bringing It All Back Home.”

But as the Cold War passed without nuclear calamity, federal funding and interest in the shelters faded, their signs rusted and, in 1980, Mr. Blakeley retired from government service, his omens of Armageddon all but forgotten or, where they still remained on buildings, ignored.

When his children were young, he told Mr. Geerhart, “We’d go down the street, and one of the kids would say, ‘Hey, Dad, there’s one of your signs.’ But, you know, other than that it’s just like many of the other things that happen in life. It’s just one of those routine things.”","Robert Blakeley, Whose Fallout Shelter Sign Symbolized the Cold War, Dies at 95",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html

So many families here are having addiction problems with their loved ones, and they’re not focused on going to vote — even though those are the people that need it the most.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire cost of new enrollees under Medicaid expansion for the first three years and will continue to pay at least 90 percent. (States cover a significantly larger portion of the expenses of the regular Medicaid program.) The law allows any citizen with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level — $16,642 for an individual, $24,600 for a family of four — to qualify.

The main arguments for expanding the program here are that it would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without it.

But Mr. LePage and other opponents say that Maine should know better. The state undertook a more modest expansion of Medicaid in 2002, under former Gov. Angus King, an independent. Afterward, Maine struggled with budget shortfalls and fell behind on Medicaid payments to hospitals.

“People don’t want to acknowledge the unintended consequences that Maine has already experienced,” said Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to Mr. LePage who is serving as the spokesman for Welfare to Work, the committee leading the opposition. He said that even with the federal government paying most of the cost — a situation that could change if Congress eventually succeeds in repealing Obamacare — the state could owe close to $100 million a year, according to estimates from the LePage administration.

The Office of Program and Fiscal Review has estimated a lower state cost, about $54 million a year once the federal share drops to 90 percent in 2021. Maine would not receive the full 90 percent match for parents of young children because many already qualify for the program.

Maine’s legislature, which is controlled by Democrats in the House and Republicans, by one vote, in the Senate, could move to block the referendum if it were to pass, but since it voted for Medicaid expansion five times already, supporters and opponents alike believe it is unlikely to meddle.

Much of the income inequality in the county, which is still acutely felt, is due to the aftereffects of the systematic racism of apartheid, which ended in 1994. Decades of work to abolish that system culminated in the swearing-in of Nelson Mandela as the nation’s first black head of state.

If you’re looking to experience the essentials of that history, a visit to Soweto is a must. Just a 25-minute drive from downtown, Soweto (which stands for South Western Township) was a major center of apartheid resistance in the ’70s and ’80s. I went along on a half-day Soweto tour booked through the Curiocity Backpackers hostel (350 rand) with about a dozen other people and found the experience more than worth the effort.

Photo

Our guide, Semphiwe, was sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, giving us all names in Zulu or Xhosa and ribbing us if we couldn’t pronounce them properly. He was from Soweto, and extremely proud of it, noting that it has over a million residents. And it was the only place, he said, where you could, at one point, find two Nobel Peace Prize winners (Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu) living on one street. “And they say it’s not safe!” he said, feigning exasperation.

We first stopped by Kliptown, one of Soweto’s poorest areas, and the Little Rose Center, a school and youth center. The overwhelming poverty of the shanties and tin-roof shacks of Kliptown was sobering — we spent roughly 30 minutes winding through the mazelike, dirt roads, distinguished only by the odd spray-painted wooden board or the rusted-out iron coils of a mattress.

We also saw the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in the Orlando West neighborhood (admission, 30 rand), which documents the killing of 12-year-old Pieterson by police, a key moment during the 1976 Soweto Uprising; and we saw the Apartheid Museum (85 rand), about 10 miles east of Orlando West, which captures the nuances and the horrors of that system. A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to Mandela, including old letters and personal effects as well as a replica of his tiny cell on Robben Island.

AFTER AN EMOTIONAL TOUR of Johannesburg and Soweto, a meditative train ride was just what I needed. In planes, you’re typically traveling too quickly and high up to notice anything, and cars are inherently confining. On a train, though, you can do almost anything you would do at home: Eat, nap, read, play cards.

Another benefit of riding the Shosholoza Meyl was having a sharpened sense of movement and travel. Harry Emanuel, a fellow passenger, noted that border crossings are more meaningful when done by land. “On a plane you just stamp your passport,” he said. “Physically crossing you actually get a sense that, oh, this is a big deal.”

Meals, generally an attempt at something upscale, were good overall. A dinner might start with soup followed by a hake filet, leg of lamb, then tiramisù, and finally a plate of cheese and biscuits. It was not quite gourmet, but on par with, say, first-class airline food. Service was friendly and helpful.

Trains force your brain to slow down. With no internet access and the knowledge you’ll be on a train for an entire day, you have to mine your creative resources. I played a game of Scrabble — in Afrikaans, no less — with a friendly woman named Lueen and her two friends. My traveling companion and I sat for hours after dinner quizzing each other on world capitals. I finished an actual book for the first time in longer than I care to admit. It was wonderful and sad — wonderful to recapture this organic way of having fun, and sad to realize I’d likely soon be back to my old ways.

I also spent a decent amount of time just looking out the window, as the scenery gradually morphed from flat grassland to sharp mountain peaks. I usually travel by plane, an environment where people are usually slightly harried and irritated. Here, it was the opposite: We chatted, drank coffee, relaxed and counted ourselves lucky to take part in such a special journey.

I caught Mr. Stander, the train’s employee, gazing out the window several times. A 40-year veteran of the industry, from a small township four hours east of Cape Town, he seemed to be showing no signs of tiring of his job. “Like I say,” he said, “Here you do not need a TV.”",A Meditative Train Ride Through South Africa,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/travel/south-africa-train-johannesburg-soweto.html

Mary Oliver, poet. I read at night, before bed. Lately I have been diving into many lovely memoirs, then I discovered Mary Oliver. Does she count as a hero? I do not know. But her beautiful poems and essays about nature are soothing to me, and her words remind me what words can do, and what an American can do with them. The Earth and our natural world is a fantastic healer and salve in these crushing times.

Senator John McCain, hands down, for his unbelievable courage as a P.O.W. during the Vietnam War. He exemplified what is best in a human being in terms of mental and physical courage. Since then, throughout his political career, he has demonstrated over and over again a willingness to draw lines in the sand when service to the Party seemed to threaten service to the fundamental ideals of the democracy.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Mr. Joyce formally renounced his dual citizenship after the scandal began and is now eligible to run.

“The decision of the court today is clearly not the outcome we were hoping for,” Mr. Turnbull said, “but the business of government goes on.”

The issue erupted in July when Scott Ludlam, a longtime Greens party senator from Western Australia, abruptly resigned after discovering he had retained New Zealand citizenship after becoming a naturalized Australian. While his supporters lamented the loss of a leader who had made a name with his stirring speeches and stern antinuclear stance, opponents accused the party of lackadaisical vetting.

Members of Australia’s most prominent parties began contacting foreign offices and consulates. To a mix of both broad amusement and dismay, five other senators — Matt Canavan of the Liberal National Party, Malcolm Roberts of the One Nation party, Fiona Nash of the Nationals, Nick Xenophon of the Nick Xenophon Team and Larissa Waters of the Australian Greens party — were found to have citizenship of other countries. So was Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister and House member.

On Friday, the court ruled that only Mr. Canavan and Mr. Xenophon had been eligible to run.

As the cases wound through the courts, the local news media named the group “the Citizenship Seven.”

Their situations varied. Some were born overseas and incorrectly believed they had renounced their citizenship rights. One senator, Mr. Xenophon, said he discovered that he held a rare type of British citizenship through his father, who left Cyprus before it gained independence from Britain. Another senator, Ms. Nash, said she was unaware she had been granted British citizenship by descent through her estranged Scottish father.

Mr. Joyce’s chances of regaining his seat were bolstered after the ruling when his most formidable rival, Tony Windsor, declined to enter the race. But Mr. Joyce is likely to face other challengers.

Tanya Plibersek, the deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party, asked why Mr. Turnbull had allowed Mr. Joyce to stay in Parliament and make decisions despite facing the prospect that he would be declared ineligible.

“It is an extraordinary lapse of judgment from the prime minister,” she said.

Clive Bean, a professor of political science at the Queensland University of Technology, said Mr. Joyce’s party would probably keep the seat.

Still, voters may behave unpredictably in by-elections, he said. “Sometimes even a safe government seat may even be at risk because voters think, ‘Well, we’re going to send a message to the government in what we’re doing.’”

While the government would lose its formal majority in the lower chamber if Mr. Joyce does not win the by-election, it still has a tiebreaking vote in the speaker of the House, Tony Smith, a Liberal ally of Mr. Turnbull.

The government’s grip can be further solidified with the backing of independent members of Parliament. One such member, Cathy McGowan, has already said she would continue to vote in support.

The by-election is not the only concern Mr. Joyce faces, said Anne Twomey, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney.

“There may be legal challenges to decisions he’s made in the past, and that might be problematic,” she said. “This is all uncharted territory.”

In the cases before the High Court, the solicitor general representing the Commonwealth, Stephen Donoghue, had argued that five of the politicians, most of whom inherited citizenship, could not have known they held foreign citizenship without expert knowledge of foreign legal systems in relation to their family roots. Once they were aware, he argued, they had made reasonable efforts to renounce foreign allegiances and thus should not be disqualified from office.

To Mr. Donoghue’s surprise, two of the politicians in the cases — Mr. Ludlam and Ms. Waters — argued that all seven should be disqualified. Both resigned their positions after their dual citizenship came to light. Mr. Xenophon also announced his resignation but for an unrelated reason: to run for the lower house of the State Parliament in South Australia.

Mr. Xenophon said that although he had won his case, he felt sympathy for his colleagues who lost.

The dinner parties started years ago in an unfinished loft in industrial Brooklyn: chickens cooked in a balky oven and served on a banged-up old table someone found on the street. My wife and I were unmarried then, childless, but already, it seemed, in the process of building a sort of home, the sort we wanted to live in, where there’s always something happening in the kitchen, always a lot of people bustling about and always an extra seat for whoever’s around: friends from college, from work, from the bar. We’d put the call out on a weekend morning: You free for dinner? Then make a salad to go with the meat, roast some potatoes with onions and rosemary, slide a few baguettes onto the table, serve a lot of wine. We did this often enough that the eating became not just simple sustenance but instead a kind of rolling weekly party of six people, eight, 10, informal and slightly disorganized, our room filled with conversation and good cheer. Eventually the calls started coming in rather than going out: You cooking tonight?

Later we cooked in an airy apartment a few miles north, next to a candle factory that filled the air with strange vanilla scents: big feeds of shredded pork or brisket and heaps of steamed greens, as babies slept in their car seats next to their parents’ chairs. We were a family by then, in fact as much as spirit. We moved the babies east, to a tiny old house on the end of Long Island where we would put a dozen or more people around a table for eight to eat epic meals of clams and corn, ribs and rice. Arms got tangled as people who sometimes hardly knew one another reached for the food. Someone put a name to that, to the way you’d have to snake your arm under someone else’s just to get to the butter, the salad, a bottle, the salt: the boardinghouse reach.

Table Talk Go for empathy when you talk politics. Showing how a political issue affects you intimately is more important than data and statistics. Try leading with a personal story.

We took the boardinghouse reach to dinners in Connecticut after that, where we simmered chili and cooked fragrant roast lamb and served it outside on a picnic table under towering oaks after picking up friends at the train. We took it to Maine, where we cooked on a wood stove and ate over a plywood table lighted with kerosene lamps: cod cakes, slaw, chicken paprikash. We reached across tables on sticky urban roofs under the night sky, in suburban yards under string lights, in rooms that were small and dingy, large and luxurious. We cooked for family real and imagined, usually casually, occasionally formally, ideally somewhere between the two. The point was just to cook — or, more accurate, the point was just to get people to gather around a table and eat, and to do so regularly enough that they knew that it would happen again soon.

Is that a proper dinner party, to eat that way? It is when the company’s good and you can have ice-cream sandwiches for dessert. There won’t be coasters for the cocktails, and you’ll need to hold on to your fork between courses — if indeed there are courses. Coats will be piled on a bed or draped over a banister in the hall. You may need to sit on a stool or a box. But there will always be candles set out and hot dogs in the back of the fridge if someone’s kid doesn’t like the mushrooms in the lasagna or the oxtails in the stew. A dinner party to me is just dinner, served to a crowd that can ebb or flood depending on the season or the weather, on whether a call went out or a work schedule changed.

This sort of entertaining requires flexibility in planning. When all are welcome, people bring other people. So you will want to ask your guests to bring beverages and flowers and other markers of good cheer. Asking helps underscore the message of the night: We’re all in this together. (I always ask for dessert.) To that end as well, don’t cook food that’s portioned as single servings — go with things that can easily be spread across more portions than you’d planned, in case someone brings a new girlfriend, some kid’s friends, somebody’s mom or dad. I like tacos for that, huge salads, lots of potatoes.

Table Talk To ensure a guest’s story becomes truly interesting, just ask two questions over and over: what and why. What exactly happened? What did that feel like? Seek emotional specifics. And then: Why? Why is this anecdote important? This is where the guest’s most thoughtful connection to a story lies.

For much the same reason, a dinner party of the sort I enjoy demands a casual approach to setting the table and to setting a time when you’re actually going to eat. You want to edge into the evenings slowly, engaging in a kind of hospitality that encourages repose rather than nervousness that you’re not going to know which fork to use when you eventually sit down. That takes a kind of confidence, the sort you gain only by practice. It requires that you act as a host. Make sure there is music playing, though not so loudly that you can’t hear people talk. Then, as people arrive, make sure they get a glass of wine or a beer or a rather larger cocktail than they’d make for themselves. Introduce the outgoing ones to people they don’t know; lead the shy to their friends or put them to work in the kitchen, peeling vegetables or stirring a pot. And soon enough it happens, right in front of you: Conversation burbles, runs to fishing and novels, to politics and farming, nearly always to real estate, always to laughs. I watch the energy build. It always builds.

And then, when there’s a good, convivial buzz in the air, I call everyone to attention and serve shellfish in the kitchen or out in the yard, steamed clams or shucked oysters or peel-your-own shrimp, meant to be consumed standing up, as if we were animals at a trough, though the sort of animals who drink prosecco with their feed. I do that because it’s delicious and different (we’re not sitting down?) and special, but also because I believe it acts as a kind of dinner bell in the universe, a dog whistle heard by only my knucklehead friends who said they’d be coming at 6 but then got caught up in replacing a water filter on the boat until well after 7.

Dinner at last! The candles are flickering, and everyone’s ready to eat, and you may find yourself nervous that you haven’t made enough food, particularly because you’ve seen the damage that the big fellow who came with Jim’s sister put on the clams. Never worry. Put everything out as a buffet, or arrange platters family-style at the table, and let your guests have at the feast. The modern parable of the loaves and fishes does not require a miracle, merely adherence to a social contract that makes everyone responsible for ensuring there’s enough food for all. I have served these meals for more than 20 years. There is almost always enough food for all. Indeed, and particularly for those just starting out, there are usually leftovers. The best dinner parties offer memories that last a long time, and a few extra meals besides.

Here’s how the Astros beat the Dodgers in Game 3, inning by inning:

Photo

Top 1st: McCullers gets three quick outs.

Game 3 began at 8:21 p.m. Eastern with Lance McCullers of the Astros throwing a 95 mile-per-hour fastball low and outside for ball one to Chris Taylor of the Dodgers. McCullers eventually got Taylor to pop out to second and retired Corey Seager when Jose Altuve made a great diving play in shallow-right to knock the ball down before throwing Seager out at first. The inning ended with Justin Turner flying out to deep center.

Waldstein: Yu Darvish takes the mound in the bottom of the first for the Dodgers as the first Japanese starting pitcher in the World Series in 10 years. The last one was Daisuke Matsuzaka for the Boston Red Sox in their four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies in 2007. Matsuzaka also started Game 3.

Darvish has plenty of experience pitching at Minute Maid Park from his days with the Texas Rangers. He comes into the game with a 4-1 record and a 2.16 earned run average, so the Dodgers are pinning a lot of their hopes on him replicating that success here.

Bottom 1st: Darvish gets out of jam.

George Springer worked a 3-1 count against Yu Darvish and then pounced on a fastball in the zone, hitting a hard liner to center for a double. Alex Bregman made Darvish work, fouling off five pitches in an eight-pitch at-bat, but ultimately grounded out to third, which kept Springer at second. Jose Altuve flew out to deep center, which sent Springer to third, but Darvish got ahead in the count and Carlos Correa grounded out to short to end the inning.

Top 2nd: Dodgers make some noise, but no runs.

Lance McCullers threw half of his 12 pitches in the inning to one batter, but worked around a single to keep the game scoreless. He needed just three pitches to strike out Cody Bellinger, as the rookie infielder almost fell down as he swung wildly at a knuckle-curve. One pitch to Yasiel Puig and McCullers had a second out on a grounder to second, but Logan Forsythe got the Dodgers’ first hit on a single to right. Forsythe was able to steal second as Austin Barnes worked a six-pitch at-bat, but the half-inning ended when Barnes grounded out to third.

Photo

Bottom 2nd: Astros jump all over Darvish and score 4 runs.

Yu Darvish struggled to put pitches where he wanted them and that led to a great inning for struggling Astros batters. Only six outs into the game, Dave Roberts had seen enough and removed his No. 3 starter with the Dodgers already down 4-0.

Yulieski Gurriel, who was 1 for 7 in Games 1 and 2, led things off by unloading on a fastball for a solo home run. Josh Reddick, whose bat had been almost entirely silent, doubled to left for his first extra-base hit of the postseason. Evan Gattis walked and Marwin Gonzalez, who had been in a horrible funk leading up to his game-tying home run in Game 2, singled off the wall in left, scoring Reddick.

With runners on first and second with no outs, Brian McCann, who was hitless in the first two games of the series, looped a ball into right-center that brought home Gattis and sent Gonzalez to third.

Photo

Darvish finally got his first out when George Springer, the sixth batter of the half-inning, lined out to second, but Alex Bregman hit a fly ball deep enough to center to give Gonzalez enough time to tag up and score, making the score 4-0.

Jose Altuve doubled to left, sending McCann over to third, and that brought out Roberts, who replaced Darvish with Kenta Maeda. Maeda needed just two pitches to end the inning, getting Carlos Correa to fly out to right.

Darvish’s final line was one and two-thirds innings, six hits and four runs. He walked one and had no strikeouts in the shortest start of his career.

Waldstein: Darvish did not have it tonight. Even the outs were on balls that were hit hard. Gurriel started it by ripping a line-drive home run into the left field bleachers, which can be home to some of the cheapest home runs in baseball. Not to say that it was cheap, because he hammered the ball. But the distance is 315 feet, only 5 feet deeper than Fenway Park in Boston. But the wall here is about half the height of the 37-foot Green Monster, so it is one of the most tantalizing targets in baseball for a right-handed pull hitter, as Gurriel showed. It was the sixth home run hit in the last four innings of this World Series, going back to the extra innings of Game 2.

Photo

Top 3rd: Dodgers get one back.

Given a fairly sizable lead, Lance McCullers walked the bases loaded to start the third, but managed to get out of the half-inning having only allowed one run. It was a rough start, as he engaged in a battle with Joc Pederson. The boom-or-bust hitter fought off several good pitches in what proved to be a nine-pitch walk. Undoubtedly frustrated by putting Pederson on base, McCullers responded with walks to Kike Hernandez and Chris Taylor. He got some help when his defense turned a double-play on a grounder from Corey Seager, and ended the inning by getting Justin Turner to ground out to short. The inning could’ve gone far worse for McCullers, who should be happy with a 4-1 score.

Waldstein: You want to make a pitching coach crazy? Get handed a 4-0 lead and then go to the mound and walk the No. 8, No. 9 and No. 1 hitters to load the bases with nobody out. That’s what Lance McCullers, Jr. just did. But thanks to some terrific defense, including by McCullers, himself, the Astros avoided big damage. The big play was getting Corey Seager to ground into a double play that required some exceptional synchronized movement and pinpoint throws from the Astros to complete. First baseman Yuli Gurriel threw a strike off the wrong foot to Carlos Correa coming across the second base bag and he, while in stride, delivered the ball to a moving target in McCullers covering first. That kind of cohesion begins in spring training.

Photo

Bottom 3rd: Maeda cools down Astros’ batters.

After a pair of lengthy half-innings for both teams, Kenta Maeda made quick work of the Astros in the third. He started by getting a pair of matching pop-outs to third from Yulieski Gurriel and Josh Reddick. A walk to Evan Gattis was a mild speed bump, but Maeda finished things off by getting Marwin Gonzalez to ground out to first to end the inning.

Photo

Top 4th: Puig’s gamble backfires.

A bang-bang play went Houston’s way, sending the Dodgers down in order. With one out, Yasiel Puig hit a grounder down the third-base line that Alex Bregman could not quite reach. The ball skipped into foul territory, but Puig took some time before realizing he should round first and Carlos Correa was able to corral the ball and throw him out at second. Stoked to have two outs despite the hard hit by Puig, Lance McCullers ended things by getting Logan Forsythe to fly out to right.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Waldstein: Yasiel Puig has been caught admiring balls before, but this time he suffered from putting his head down and hustling to first base. After hitting a sharp bouncer down the third base line, Puig ran so hard that he did not see the ball had skipped past third baseman Alex Bregman. Puig overran first, slowed down and only then realized he should have been headed to second. By the time he restarted and slid into second, the ball was in Jose Altuve’s glove and Puig was tagged out.

Bottom 4th: Maeda’s relief appearance gives Dodgers hope.

Kenta Maeda has done a terrific job of settling things down after Yu Darvish’s disastrous start. Brian McCann led off fourth against him by looping a ball just out of Corey Seager’s reach in shallow left field for a single. But Maeda was unfazed and went on to strike out George Springer on four pitches and Alex Bregman on five. He got out of the inning when Jose Altuve grounded out to short.

Maeda is up to 38 pitches in two and one-thirds innings of relief as the Dodgers try to get as much as they can from one of the team’s three best relievers.

Photo

Top 5th: McCullers gets out of trouble again.

Lance McCullers worked around some tremendous hustle from Joc Pederson to pitch another scoreless inning, with some help from George Springer. With one out, Pederson hit what looked like a single to center. But the young outfielder ran hard right out of the box and managed to stretch the soft hit into a double. Kike Hernandez sent him to third on a groundout to second, but McCullers got out of the inning when Chris Taylor hit a shallow fly to center that a diving Springer was able to snare for the third out.","World Series 2017: How the Astros Won Game 3, Inning by Inning",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/sports/world-series-dodgers-astros.html

[Laughs] Occasionally. And I will say, occasionally it’s super embarrassing. They’re becoming teenagers now — they’re like 14 and 15 — and so of course there are girl issues and body issues. They want to know about girls or a little bit about sex. They’re hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I don’t feel like it’s appropriate that I have those conversations with them. So I offer them little bits of advice and then generally go off and get a cup of coffee and wait until it dies down.

You’re like a cool uncle.

Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy who’s able to be on set saying, “All right, come on kids, let’s get down to work.” So in some ways I’m a cool uncle, and in some ways I’m like a nasty physics teacher.

Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?

No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to. One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didn’t want to become the dad on “Full House,” or whatever, who’s just a dad. Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce — you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.

You’ve said that you were once told that you were “too fat” to play the Blob. Now you’re playing a shirtless superhero. How hard is it to maintain a healthy body image as a man in Hollywood?

The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool — I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff. And I really couldn’t get that much work.

Then “Stranger Things” came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, “O.K. I’m going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.” And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism. In that first scene [in Season 1], where he’s shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: “Come on, this guy doesn’t work out. Play the character. Don’t play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.”

And that was where things turned around for me. It was like, “Oh, people want to see real human beings,” and I’ve been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity.

It occupies a position in the canon that is unusual even by opera’s stubbornly backward-looking standards, particularly in Europe. The Vienna State Opera and the Teatro alla Scala in Milan both still use Zeffirelli stagings from 1963, and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich continues to present an Otto Schenk one from 1969.

But this fall brings a highly unusual coincidence: new productions of the opera at two of Europe’s most important houses. At the Royal Opera in London, Richard Jones’s fresh version — the company’s first since 1974 — recently finished its premiere run here and will return in June. And on Dec. 1, the Paris Opera will unveil Claus Guth’s provocative staging, set a century from now.

These new takes on this classic of classics raise the question of whether “La Bohème” should be messed with at all. We seem to have an almost instinctive desire for this piece to remain the same, to be the opera we encountered as children. Is that something we should resist or accept?

And if it’s indeed fair game for new approaches: How? When a director sets Wagner’s “Ring” cycle at, say, the dawn of industrialization, it illuminates new aspects of a deep, ambiguous work. But while doing “Bohème” in the 1950s or, à la “Rent,” in the AIDS-era East Village may involve a change of clothes, it’s still the same, simple love story.

So forget should you do a new “Bohème”: Can you do a new — a really new — “Bohème”? Is there an approach to this work that isn’t just moving the attic stove, a fixture of the libretto, from stage right to left to center?

Mr. Jones’s strong, even hyperbolic, Royal Opera production tries diligently to bridge old-fashioned and progressive. It begins with the element perhaps most associated with the piece: snow, already falling gently onstage in front of the curtain as the audience enters.

The Victorian-era costumes are detailed and elaborate, a contrast with the austere settings, often flooded in harsh frontal lighting. There is hardly any furniture in the young bohemians’ Paris garret, making the space resemble an empty stage. The audience can see the backstage workings throughout: the lighting rigs, even the snow machine tube rotating overhead in the flies.

The sets of previous acts are visible just offstage; scene changes take place in full view. You can see stagehand markings in chalk on the back of the set pieces; the characters then make their own charcoal drawings — musical notes and all — in the final act. We are in a theater, Mr. Jones is at pains to remind us, and this is an opera.

Within this lightly Brechtian frame, the acting is more or less naturalistic, with a few cartoonish touches. In the first act, when she comes upstairs to light her candle, the already ill Mimì faints dead away; rather than being concerned, Rodolfo is almost amused, tapping her with his foot. In the second act, at Café Momus, the hellcat Musetta doesn’t just flirt with the crowd but pulls off her underwear and throws it; she and her estranged lover, Marcello, boisterously kiss the same woman. (Suffice to say a bit of casual bisexuality isn’t on offer in most “Bohème” productions.)

The staging manages to infuse the old war horse with a genuine mood — a real, if occasionally exaggerated, melancholy — without alienating those looking for hoop skirts and a parade at the end of Act 2. But in the end, it’s more or less just a shift of the stove.

The coming Paris production, the details of which are being closely kept, will not be nearly so indulgent of audience expectations. “The second the curtain opens, you have a fist in your face,” Mr. Guth, the director, said in a phone interview.

Mr. Guth, acclaimed for stylized, even surreal productions that nevertheless remain moored to reality, hadn’t thought his style was a good match for Puccini, and he didn’t like the clichés about artists endemic to “Bohème” stagings. But listening to the music alone and brainstorming conceptual approaches brought him to the 1851 Henri Murger book on which the libretto is based.

“In the end,” he said, “it turns out that these men meet again. They look back, and they are not now artists. They are now established bourgeoisie. They remember their youth, when they were doing wild stuff.”

So his “Bohème,” which will star Sonya Yoncheva and Atalla Ayan and be conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, takes the form of a kind of flashback to a lost time — much as Paris today, he observed, is a kind of fantasy of what the city once was.

“He wants to put ‘La Bohème’ at the end of the 21st century, in the future,” Stéphane Lissner, the general director of the Paris Opera, said in an interview in his office. “To speak about what is the artist’s situation, what is the memory we have of the past.”

The marketing image on the company’s website is a futuristic-looking pod, which is apparently where at least some of the action will take place. This radical intervention replaces Jonathan Miller’s staging from 1995, which updated the opera to the 1930s Left Bank but otherwise left it mostly alone. That staging has, Mr. Lissner said, “not one idea for me. The Jonathan Miller is for me absolutely nothing. So it’s time to try.”

Mr. Guth’s concept bears some similarity to the director Stefan Herheim’s, unveiled in Oslo in 2012 and available on a crucial DVD. That production uses the traditional storybook sets of the Norwegian National Opera’s 1963 “Bohème,” but begins with a bleakly modern scene: a hospital room in which a man’s lover has just died of cancer.

The “La Bohème” we know then emerges as his fantasy of her recuperation, though a fantasy shot through with intimations of darkness and death. As in “The Wizard of Oz,” the doctors and nurses from the hospital also populate this Rodolfo’s dream world; it is one of the saddest, loveliest spectacles I’ve ever seen.

Photo

Mr. Herheim’s staging is about loss and denial. It’s also about what we seek from opera, the kind of escape into an idyllic past — our culture’s and our own — that we get from productions like Mr. Zeffirelli’s, which over the past 35 years at the Met has played nearly 500 performances and sold 650,000 tickets.

I would not want to be without Mr. Herheim’s vision, which celebrates, without undue indulgence, the sentimentality that permeates “La Bohème.” But I’ve lately been more than reconciled to the Zeffirelli, the age and familiarity of which have added a poignancy that enhances the piece — that, in some sense, completes it.

I felt differently about the Met’s ancient production of Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier,” finally replaced last season. The old staging had grown dull and dowdy — and besides, “Rosenkavalier” is not just a simulacrum of 18th-century Vienna but is also about what the new version, set on the cusp of World War I, made more vivid: the change of generations, the war of the classes, the end of a world.

The old “Rosenkavalier” didn’t evoke any of those depths; the Zeffirelli “Bohème,” on the other hand, really does give us “La Bohème,” in all its shallow brilliance and beauty. The nostalgia we feel for it has become as much a part of the opera as Puccini’s score. I look forward to the avant-garde iteration of the staging that will commence in a few decades, when the singers will need to negotiate a literally decomposing set; what better symbol of Mimì’s fatal consumption?

But, until then, why move the stove merely to move it?

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation.","The matching messages point to a synchronized information campaign. Like some other Russian experts, Stephen Blank, a senior fellow with the nonprofit American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, said they indicate that Ms. Veselnitskaya’s actions “were coordinated from the very top.”

The Trump Tower meeting is of keen interest to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a widespread fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to the Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family, to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last Friday, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of Russian analysts called it inconceivable Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

This week, Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the fact that Democrats had paid the firm for the research as evidence that the dossier was part of a political smear campaign.

Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that it was a “disgrace” that Democrats had funded the dossier, calling it “a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”

At the heart of the story is Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm founded by former Wall Street Journal employees. Little is known about the firm’s list of clients, and Republicans in Congress have pressed the firm and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, to hand over documents about the funding and research that produced the dossier.

The Free Beacon’s editor, Matthew Continetti, and its chairman, Michael Goldfarb, said in a statement that the website was not involved in the dossier.

“All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier,” they said. “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”

The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS to research any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, his campaign team and Russia, court filings revealed this week. Working for them, the firm retained Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence officer.

He went on to produce a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos, which became known as the “Steele dossier,” also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, as well as real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

Speculation had circulated for months that Mr. Singer was involved in the dossier, but his allies had denied that. On Friday, an associate said Mr. Singer had not been aware of the dossier or Mr. Steele’s involvement in Fusion GPS’s research until January, when BuzzFeed published the dossier.

Mr. Singer was among the leading Republican critics of Mr. Trump during the Republican presidential primary race. Even after Mr. Singer’s first choice, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, dropped out of the race, Mr. Singer continued to fund efforts to block Mr. Trump from the party’s nomination.

The revelation of The Free Beacon’s involvement with Fusion GPS threatens a rapprochement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Singer, who donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural fund and has visited the White House on multiple occasions. After one such visit, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Singer “was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ‘Never Trump,’ and Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support and it’s all about unification.”

Josh Levy, a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, said questions about who funded Mr. Steele’s work should be secondary to its credibility.

The Free Beacon has a history of employing so-called opposition research firms to assist in news articles critical of targets like Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. In their statement, Mr. Continetti and Mr. Goldfarb said that “we stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods.”



Investigators working with several congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have delved into Mr. Steele’s work as part of inquiries into connections between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including whether they conspired to influence last year’s election.

The Free Beacon’s notification to the House Intelligence Committee came a few days before a deadline set by a federal judge for Fusion GPS’s bank to respond to a subpoena issued by the committee for financial records that could have revealed who funded the dossier.

Fusion GPS had filed a motion to block the subpoena on the grounds that it would “irreparably damage” the company’s business and also “chill” its free speech rights and those of “many others engaging in opposition research on political candidates.”

In a telephone conference with representatives for Fusion GPS, the committee and the bank, the judge hearing the case said that Fusion GPS’s clients have “the expectation of confidentiality.” But the judge added that it was “not to say that the congressional committee doesn’t have interests that may trump those expectations of confidentiality.”

The firm’s connection to Democrats was revealed in a letter this week from Matthew J. Gehringer, the managing partner of the law firm Perkins Coie. The letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research “for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest,” and urged the earlier clients to waive their confidentiality “given the interest in this issue.”

The cafe’s wooden-slatted building is surrounded by weathered seating, as well as raised garden beds with wild overgrown herbs, tomatoes, and tiny pansies that decorate the desserts sold inside. Chickens wander among the tables with entitled beady stares, begging for scraps. Inside, up some ramshackle steps, a line of customers forms early at lunchtime to order at the counter and take a number. If they get there after noon they’ll spend some time outside hovering until one of the tables or benches is vacated. (A park across the street provides some needed extra seating.)

Sushi is available at lunch as prepackaged rolls to go, daily specials listed on a blackboard and freshly made hand rolls. The most economical tactic is to order one or two of the rolls from the short menu beside the cash register, but you’ll miss out on the gorgeous salads that accompany the special roll of the day.

The salads here might be punctuated with pink peppercorns, or pepitas, or thin threads that resemble saffron but are actually dehydrated red peppers of varying degrees of spiciness. Tasmanian sea trout sashimi comes fanned out in sweet, pinkish-orange buttery slivers under a mound of greens, herbs and flowers. The impossibly tender beef filet is nestled among one of these kaleidoscopic salads, the meat kissed with yuzu and fresh coriander, as is the eggplant dengaku, which is cooked to a puddinglike fudge along with sweet white miso and served over organic quinoa. If this sounds a little like the gluten-free grain bowls in high demand down the hill in Byron, that’s exactly what it is, upgraded considerably by a dose of deft Japanese technique and flavor.

The short list of burgers here has influences beyond Japan, with extras like Greek halloumi cheese or a sauce made from Spanish-smoked paprika. The patties are shot through with fennel and coriander, and that halloumi burger also sports korokke, a crispy potato patty described on the menu as a Japanese hash brown.

Customers are mainly locals — the restaurant has no website; no one else would know to make the drive up here — but that “local” designation has wide meaning. This part of the world still has a true rural Australian soul, but it now has some of the highest property values in the country, thanks mainly to its proximity to Byron Bay (a former hippie mecca that has morphed into a playground for the moneyed boho set). The customers sitting on the worn wooden benches in Doma’s yard range from newcomers wearing designer linen caftans — colored to match their designer dogs — to tradespeople in dusty boots on their lunch break. If there’s a tension between the two types of locals, it feels easy here among the chickens and flowers.

At breakfast, there are egg and bacon sandwiches, very good espresso drinks and breakfast sushi hand rolls. If you’ve ever wondered what a Japanese hash brown tastes like when rolled up in nori, here’s your chance. (Answer: silly, salty, a little unnecessary, but fun above all else.) The Doma Brekkie is a huge plate of creamy scrambled eggs, a pile of bacon, alarmingly red tomato slices, avocado, sweet onion relish, and sourdough or Japanese brown rice.

In so many ways, Doma is an exemplar of the great Australian cafe — international in its scope, wonderfully casual, but blessed with quality and creativity worthy of fine dining. There’s even avocado toast at breakfast. Of course there is.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

Kissinger.","Concerned that Washington might peddle its own, self-serving version of events, the Poles launched a pre-emptive strike in what quickly became a “war of leaks.” Violating a mutual-secrecy pledge, the Polish foreign minister, Adam Rapacki, directed his diplomats in Rome and New York to reveal the peace effort and share Poland’s view on why it fizzled to Pope Paul VI and the secretary general of the United Nations, U Thant, who in turn radiated secondary leaks, including to the Canadian and French ambassadors to the United Nations.

After Secretary of State Dean Rusk learned from the Canadians, on New Year’s Day 1967, that a “disturbing” Polish-inspired account of Marigold was circulating, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized a round of quiet counterleaks to the pope, Thant, the Canadians and the British. Word of the failed peace bid spread to chancelleries around the globe — and, inevitably, also seeped out to reporters.

Robert H. Estabrook, the Washington Post’s United Nations correspondent, broke the story in early February, making banner front-page headlines. The insinuation that Washington had squandered an authentic peace chance infuriated American officials; the United Nations ambassador Arthur Goldberg fingered the “tendentious” Poles for the leak. (Decades later, Estabrook revealed that his source was actually a Danish diplomat, supplemented, his notes show, by Thant and Canadian and Yugoslav sources.)

In response, the Johnson administration, led by Rusk and the national security adviser, Walt Rostow, plotted to leak a more sympathetic story, and found an ideal conduit: John M. Hightower, the veteran national security specialist at The Associated Press. Hightower even received guidance from administration officials, notably Rusk himself, in meetings and phone calls to “tidy up” his draft: “Sec. told H. to write the story that takes into account some of the things Sec. has said privately and then Sec. will go over certain points with H.”

Hightower’s article, reflecting the American view that the Communists, not Washington, had destroyed any peace prospects, was featured by The New York Times (which never published its own inquiry) atop its front page on May 9; it quoted unnamed “high officials” as being “skeptical that Warsaw ever had a firm commitment or Hanoi a serious intention to open secret talks.” A State Department spokesman quickly endorsed the story’s accuracy.

In other words, the first account of the Polish peace affair, with an anti-administration spin, appeared in The Washington Post, whose editorial page strongly supported the war (and basically told readers to ignore the scoop on the front page), while The New York Times, editorially a trenchant antiwar critic, trumpeted a report with a strong pro-Administration tilt, shaped backstage by Rusk.

The administration’s victory proved pyrrhic, however. The exculpatory A.P. article aroused the suspicions of the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau chief, David Kraslow, whose paper remained staunchly Republican but was keen to enhance its journalistic stature. Sensing an important tale behind the classified veil, Kraslow and the bureau’s White House reporter, Stuart H. Loory, took a leave from their usual duties to chase a blockbuster exposé.

Over the summer they made scant progress quizzing reticent officials, yet were tantalized by a conversation with one figure they would describe only as a “close associate of the President” but whom notes identify as Bill Moyers, code-named “Source M.”

Johnson’s former press secretary, who had left the White House just as the secret peace gambit withered, said the reporters would “never get the inside story” of “Marigold” — the first time they heard the still-secret code-name — because none of the 10 or so officials who knew the truth would talk to them.

Why not?

“Because it makes our government look so bad,” Mr. Moyers said.

The reporters sensed progress in October, when, on a tip from Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who had soured on the war — Kraslow visited Cambridge, Mass., to interview Henry A. Kissinger. The Harvard historian, a State Department consultant, was rumored (correctly) to be involved in a secret scheme to communicate with Hanoi via “French channels,” but he deftly deflected the reporter’s grilling. Exasperated, Kraslow threw a Hail Mary.

“We were chatting and chatting, and he was being very coy and very tight-lipped,” Kraslow remembered. “I said, ‘Henry, what do you know about Marigold?’ He turned beet-red and said, ‘How do you know about Marigold?’ And that told me everything I needed to know.”

Convinced they had a story, even a book, the reporters intensified their interviewing. They found sources — some of whom sent memos to higher-ups insisting they had intoned only the official line — who, notes indicate, actually spoke more candidly, admitting that failures to coordinate military and diplomatic tracks may have derailed multiple peace overtures.

Some top officials reacted angrily. McNamara told the reporters that anyone who spoke to them about “the most delicate subject confronting the United States government today,” other than the president or secretary of state (both refused interview requests), “should have his head cut off.” Rostow yelled that The Los Angeles Times’ probe was “as bad as giving away war secrets.” After Kraslow and Loory had fanned out to Western and Communist Eastern Europe to interview sources, the national security adviser scoffed: “Everybody and his brother knows what you’re doing. You remind me of Laurel and Hardy trying to play sleuths.”

At a late November meeting at the White House, Johnson and his aides plotted to undermine the duo. The president suggested that Rusk’s top Vietnam aide, William P. Bundy, disclose titillating tidbits on a Sunday TV talk show, while McNamara, afraid “the Canadians, the Italians and the Poles have ‘spilled their guts’” to them, proposed to “torpedo” their impending reports by leaking a more favorable version, including the “Marigold” code name, to a friendly reporter, The Washington Post’s Chalmers M. Roberts.

But again, the administration leak boomeranged. Warsaw’s ambassador in Washington, who had already spread a Polish version of Marigold, correctly inferred that Roberts’s article was intended “to take away the wind from the sails of the California journalists” and urged retaliation. In this situation, he cabled Rapacki, “we especially need to leak out information to them.” From Lewandowski in Warsaw, and D’Orlandi in Rome, Loory confirmed that both Communist Poland and the NATO member Italy had urged Washington against the Hanoi attacks that had spoiled the initiative.

In early 1968, as Kraslow and Loory wrapped up their interviews and began writing, the administration made one last thrust to steal their thunder: Bundy fed inside dope to enliven a Life magazine cover story (“Behind the Peace Feelers”), trotting out a ringer — a Hungarian diplomat who had defected the previous May but remained reclusive ever since — to back the argument that East European Vietnam diplomacy was fraudulent.

By the time the reporters published their findings, in the spring — first in a Los Angeles Times series, then a book, “The Secret Search for Peace in Vietnam” — Johnson had already dropped out of the presidential race. Historians still dispute whether Johnson missed any real opportunities for peace. But the drip-drip-drip of leaks that he had done so, both foreign and domestic, had already widened his “credibility gap,” generating charges that his peace efforts were insincere, incompetent, or both, and leaving him vulnerable to an insurgency from within his own party.",The War of Leaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/the-war-of-leaks-vietnam.html

But despite this tortured history, or perhaps because of it, the Catalan crisis does not appear to have markedly increased the zeal for Basque independence.
But after a controversial Catalan independence referendum in early October, an opinion poll found that nearly 63 percent of Basques did not want to copy the Catalan approach to achieving independence, while only 22 percent were in favor.

As the secession crisis in Catalonia deepens, attention has turned to the northern Basque region — which, like Catalonia, has its own language, culture and long history of separatism — to see if the desire for independence proves contagious.

Until the 19th century, Spanish kings swore an oath to respect Basque autonomy underneath a tree here in Guernica. But the region’s self-government was dismantled in 1876, and so it remained (barring a brief period of autonomy during the Spanish Civil War) for more than a century.

Even after its restoration, self-government was still not enough for some Basques — including a militant group, ETA, which killed more than 800 civilians, policemen and soldiers in a decades-long campaign for independence that formally ended this year.

But despite this tortured history, or perhaps because of it, the Catalan crisis does not appear to have markedly increased the zeal for Basque independence.

Many here sympathize with Catalan nationalists. But after a controversial Catalan independence referendum in early October, an opinion poll found that nearly 63 percent of Basques did not want to copy the Catalan approach to achieving independence, while only 22 percent were in favor. And while 44 percent hope for greater autonomy from Madrid, just 23 percent want their own independent country.

After over 40 years of separatist violence, many Basques want a timeout from the independence question, suggested Kirmen Uribe, an acclaimed Basque author who writes in Euskera, the Basque language.

“It’s like we’re different planets — Catalonia and the Basque Country — and we have different orbits,” Mr. Uribe said during an interview in San Sebastián, a coastal city famous for its food and shoreline. “The Basque orbit is longer, and the Catalan orbit is shorter. We need more time because we don’t want to break the Basque Country again.”

“It’s a question of timing — we don’t want independence right now,” Mr. Uribe added. “We’re more thinking about cleaning the wounds between us, between the Basque people.”

In Bilbao — the largest Basque city, and where tourism has boomed as separatist tensions have ebbed — the leader of the region’s largest nationalist party, Andoni Ortuzar, said there was no rush to achieve independence.

“Our way is our way, and we cannot change it because of the Catalan situation,” said Mr. Ortuzar, the president of the Basque Nationalist Party, or P.N.V., a conservative group that has led the Basque region for all but three years since the restoration of Basque self-government in 1979.

Instead of fast-tracking a divisive referendum, Mr. Ortuzar’s “way” is to first establish a consensus among Basque parties and institutions about the kind of autonomy they want. Then he wants to present this joint proposal to the central government in Madrid, before putting the negotiated settlement to the Basque population in a referendum.

Even then, he does not expect a referendum on outright independence.

Besides, the Basque region already has greater autonomy than Catalonia, particularly in financial affairs, Mr. Ortuzar said.

View all New York Times newsletters.

If the Catalan crisis has changed anything, it is in the corridors of power in Madrid, rather than Bilbao, Mr. Ortuzar reckoned. The Spanish government will have learned the lesson of failing to engage constructively with independence-minded regional governments, which might provide the Basque region “an opportunity” in years to come, he said.

“The Catalan situation is very grave,” he said. “But it has a good consequence: Madrid has seen the risk of closing the door. And I think that many people in Madrid have seen — even if they’re not saying it, they’re thinking it — that it is necessary to change the state model.”

But the more trenchant Basque nationalists have concluded precisely the opposite.

Madrid’s violent response to the Catalan referendum is a sign of how it will treat any effort to increase Basque autonomy, said Arnaldo Otegi, a leading figure within P.N.V.’s main nationalist rival, a far-left coalition known as Basque Country Unite, or E.H. Bildu.

The experience of Catalonia shows “there is no state to negotiate with,” said Mr. Otegi, who returned to politics last year after spending six years in prison for trying to revive a banned political party linked to ETA. “Catalonia has shown that it’s not possible to democratize the Spanish state,” he added.

Photo

This does not harbinger a return to separatist violence, which is now “out of the political equation” in the Basque region, Mr. Otegi said. “It’s not coming back. Forever.”

But it does mean that the Basque government should follow Catalonia’s example and hold a referendum before negotiating with Madrid, rather than the other way around, Mr. Otegi argued. He also expects “a reactivation” of peaceful interest in Basque nationalism, particularly among young people, he said. “Yes, it’s true there’s a fatigue after a long-term conflict — but something is changing in these past weeks.”

Analysts counter that Mr. Otegi says this more in hope than certainty. “There’s no piece of data that proves that’s happening,” said Ander Gutiérrez-Solana, a professor at the University of the Basque Country. “Not in the elections, not in the polls, not in the streets — there’s no big movement for independence.”

Tens of thousands of Basques rallied in Bilbao the day before the Catalan referendum, in solidarity with Catalonia, “but in my opinion it’s always the same people,” Mr. Gutiérrez-Solana said. “They’re not reaching new people.”

Grassroots activists nevertheless feel that something is stirring. Groups of young Basque nationalists traveled to Barcelona on the day of the referendum to learn from separatist organizers there. It was an experience that was “emotional and inspiring,” said Jone Amonarriz, one of the activists who participated.

Ms. Amonarriz, 24, is from the group It’s In Our Hands, or Gure Esku Dago, that has spent the last four years touring Basque villages, encouraging residents to revive a discussion about independence.

“We are sure that in five years,” said the group’s co-founder, Angel Oiarbide, “the situation in the Basque Country is going to be very different.”

Back in Guernica, however, Luis Iriondo voiced what others believe remains the majority opinion.

“I’d like more power,” he said. “But not if it means losing what we already have.”","Tired by Years of Separatist Strife, Many Basques Wary of New Independence Bid",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/europe/spain-catalonia-basque-independence.html

Constructor Notes

It’s pretty rare that I build a puzzle around a single, central marquee entry, but if there were ever to be such a case, GUY FAWKES MASK is about as good as I can muster. It must have been deemed too tricky for the Friday audience, but I had my fingers crossed that the original clue of “Anonymous symbol?” would make the final cut. My clues have been saved on many past occasions by the editorial team, so I can certainly respect their judgment. Maybe this is a late makeup for my “Stone work” clue for J.F.K. on a Thursday puzzle all those years ago ... Rest of the puzzle appears to hold up, even if the quadrants are a little closed off. They all feel pretty smooth, but maybe could have used another splashy modern entry or two. Perhaps a little more crossword glue might’ve done the trick. It’s always tricky to strike the right balance. Hope it’s a pleasant solve regardless. Happy puzzling!

The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.","When “Born to Run” transformed Bruce Springsteen into a star in 1975, he celebrated by following the title track’s advice: He got his own “chrome wheeled, fuel-injected” dream car.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Smithwick’s adviser, Jakob Vinther, went to China and took high resolution images of Sinosauropteryx specimens under specially polarized light, which brought out their colors.

The dark feathers — the only ones that were preserved on the fossils — were filled with melanin, the same pigment that colors our hair and skin. It is a strong molecule that is resistant to decay and can survive in fossils for hundreds of millions of years.

Mr. Smithwick mapped the pigmented feathers on the fossils, finding that the Sinosauropteryx had brownish feathers covering its back and sides that stopped about halfway down its body. The rest of the feathers were most likely lightly colored.

The color pattern is a form of camouflage known as “countershading,” and on the Sinosauropteryx the transition from dark to light happened relatively high on the body. Mr. Smithwick said that the pattern could provide insight into the type of environment where the dinosaur lived.

He made 3D models of the dinosaur’s color shading and tested them under different types of light to see where they would perform best as camouflage. He found that the pattern was most useful in open environments where sunlight is coming straight from above with little interference.

When sunlight illuminates an animal’s top, it also keeps its underside in shadow, he said. This means that when something is looking at it, whether a predator or prey, the animal is seen as a three-dimensional object.

More Reporting on Paleontology

But countershading distorts the shadows in a way that makes the animal look less three-dimensional, and harder to spot. Animals that live in open, grassy environments have sharp transitions high on their body, from dark to light. But those that live in wooded or forested areas, like deer, tend to have a more gradual transition that appears much lower on the body.

The research suggests that countershading is not a modern evolutionary development, but a timeless camouflage technique.

Mr. Smithwick added that the dark feathers around the eyes indicate that Sinosauropteryx had “bandit masks,” most famously seen in raccoons, but also in some badgers, ferrets and red pandas.

Researchers tend to think mammals use the patches as warning signs that tell predators they are aggressive and not to be messed with. But Mr. Smithwick thinks Sinosauropteryx used its eye patches either as camouflage or to block glare, like athletes who paint dark stripes under their eyes to reduce incoming sunlight.

Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the study, said the research was a leap forward in paleontologists’ understanding of Sinosauropteryx.

“We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped,” Dr. Brusatte said in an email. “These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.”",A Turkey-Size Dinosaur With a Raccoon-Like Bandit Mask,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/science/dinosaur-raccoon-bandit-mask.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years.
Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections.
Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.
“Rules are rules.”","“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”

The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.

After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?

Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.

Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.

Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.

The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.

Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.

Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.

Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.

“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.

He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.

Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.

“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”

Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.

That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.

“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.

The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.

In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.

Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.

Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.

“It was not our intention to deceive anyone, but what we did was not appropriate,” Mr. Yoshinaga said. “Rules are rules.”","Subaru Admits Inspection Failings, in Another Blow to Japan’s Carmakers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/subaru-inspection-japan.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at New York’s Leica Gallery. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice. That’s because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan. Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the president’s actions, will protect you from premium price increases.

The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year. The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.

Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.

Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.

A GUIDE TO WOMEN’S GUIDES

Judi Wineland, a veteran of the adventure travel industry, acquired AdventureWomen, one of the oldest women-only specialists, last year and brought in her 28- and 30-year-old daughters to help run the company. New trips include viewing the northern lights in Finland and seeing orangutans in Indonesia and offer women-to-women exchanges with locals, from female politicians to divers for pearl oysters in Japan.

“We’re a relationship company and our medium is travel and our travel is to less-visited places off the beaten path,” Ms. Wineland said.

Among new women-focused companies, Living Big offers small group trips to places like Iceland and Kauai where the focus is on adventure (the eight-day trip to the Hawaiian island of Kauai in May costs $3,649). But it also guides trips to Italy and New Orleans where the emphasis might shift to food or music, and customizes trips for solo travelers and small groups.

Allison Fleece and Danielle Thornton co-founded WHOA Travel, which stands for Women High on Adventure, in 2013 in a moment of inspiration after their own exhilarating climb up Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. WHOA now runs trips around the world, but its Kilimanjaro trips remain popular (from $3,400 for nine days).

“It’s safer and there’s built-in camaraderie when you’re sharing experiences,” Ms. Thornton said.

Long-established, but new to the gender-specific tour, Austin Adventures will offer three new women-only itineraries. The tours are led by Kasey Austin Morrissey, the 28-year-old daughter of the company’s owner, Dan Austin; she has worked in the family business since she was 11, and is now the company’s vice president of operations. She considers adventure trips the new spa getaways, places where women “are looking to challenge themselves and their friends by pushing their limits together.”

Trips include nine days in Costa Rica in March (from $3,498) and from six days in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks in May (from $2,798).

Responding to a rise in women traveling on its regular itineraries last year — 65 percent versus 55 percent the year prior — and the requests of its clients, Exodus Travels just announced 12 departures dedicated to and guided by women. They range from 15 days touring Iran (from $3,715) to eight days walking in Italy ($1,705) and five days climbing Mount Toubkal in Morocco (from $545).

Other companies are similarly increasing their women’s trips. REI Adventures, the travel arm of the outdoor goods retailer, saw its female participation jump 60 percent in the last seven years. In 2015, it debuted women’s trips and added 19 new itineraries to the Women’s Adventures series this year, including an 11-day trip to South Africa that combines a wildlife safari with sea kayaking, hiking and cycling (from $7,699). A 10-day trip to New Zealand hits the hiking trails of the Southern Alps (from $5,199) and a nine-day trip to Greece spans yoga sessions, vineyard hikes and cooking classes.

Seventy percent of trips run by Wild Women Expeditions, established in 1991, features backcountry camping. New 2018 departures include a trip that emphasizes hiking and other activities in Torres del Paine National Park in Chilean Patagonia (10 days from $5,295) and a multisport tour of Costa Rica (eight days from $3,295).",For Women Only: Tours That Emphasize Adventure,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/travel/tours-for-women.html

Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.
Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.
For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months.","The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trump’s Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts. He fits the mold of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street. While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.

Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law. Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.

A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.

His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode. Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.

On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn’s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration’s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.

“Justin’s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration’s top domestic priority,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.

Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump’s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.

Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush’s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a “territorial” tax system, as the current plan would also do.

“What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he’s just a policy wonk,” Mr. Bush said in an interview. “Justin has a desire to serve and he’s getting to do it at a high level, and I’m really proud of him for doing it.”

Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve. Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of “America First.” In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.

Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the “outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.”

Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes. In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.

He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinich’s conservative leanings were obvious at an early age. Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.

Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds. His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends. A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.

While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.

“I think that he is pragmatic,” said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department. “He’s looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.”

Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach. Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchin’s promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create. The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretary’s analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.

Yet Mr. Muzinich’s reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“I’m really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later,” said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.

For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months. Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.

The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.

“I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, ‘Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us,’” Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said. “I think people should be caring about other people.”",The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/the-little-known-pragmatist-who-is-shaping-the-trump-tax-cuts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened. Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study.

Oysters “must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents,” which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study. “To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.”

People who study these things have observed a marked increase in solitary “happiness pursuits” — activities carried out either completely alone or in a group without interaction — with the explicit aim of keeping each person locked in her own private emotional experience.

Spiritual and religious practice is slowly shifting from a community-based endeavor to a private one, with silent meditation retreats, mindfulness apps and yoga classes replacing church socials and collective worship. The self-help industry — with its guiding principle that the search for happiness should be an individual, self-focused enterprise — is booming, with Americans spending more than $1 billion on self-help books a year to help guide them on their inner journeys. Meanwhile, “self-care” has become the new going out.

But while placing more and more emphasis on seeking happiness within, Americans in general are spending less and less time actually connecting with other people. Nearly half of all meals eaten in this country are now eaten alone. Teenagers and young millennials are spending less time just “hanging out” with their friends than any generation in recent history, replacing real-world interaction with smartphones.

And it’s not just young people. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time Use Survey shows that the average American now spends less than four minutes a day “hosting and attending social events,” a category that covers all types of parties and other organized social occasions. That’s 24 hours a year, barely enough to cover Thanksgiving dinner, and your own child’s birthday party.

The same time-use data also allocates another, broader category to “socializing and communicating,” a designation that includes not just the good stuff — the heart-to-heart with an adoring spouse, or setting the world to rights with a dear friend over a bottle of wine — but any kind of socializing and communicating at all between two adults, where this is their main activity rather than an incidental part of something else, like working. All in all — and that includes daily bouts of nagging, arguing and whining — the average American spends barely more than half an hour a day on social communication. Compare that to time per day spent watching television (three hours) or even “grooming” (one hour for women, and just over 44 minutes for men).

Self-reflection, introspection and some degree of solitude are important parts of a psychologically healthy life. But somewhere along the line we seem to have gotten the balance wrong. Because far from confirming our insistence that “happiness comes from within,” a wide body of research tells us almost the exact opposite.

Academic happiness studies are full of anomalies and contradictions, often revealing more about the agendas and values of those conducting them than the realities of human emotion. But if there is one point on which virtually every piece of research into the nature and causes of human happiness agrees, it is this: our happiness depends on other people.

Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life, even going so far as to call them a “necessary condition for happiness,” meaning that humans can’t actually be happy without them. This is a finding that cuts across race, age, gender, income and social class so overwhelmingly that it dwarfs any other factor.

And according to research, if we want to be happy, we should really be aiming to spend less time alone. Despite claiming to crave solitude when asked in the abstract, when sampled in the moment, people across the board consistently report themselves as happier when they are around other people than when they are on their own. Surprisingly this effect is not just true for people who consider themselves extroverts but equally strong for introverts as well.

What’s more, neglecting our social relationships is actually shockingly dangerous to our health. Research shows that a lack of social connection carries with it a risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking, and is roughly twice as dangerous to our health as obesity. The most significant thing we can do for our well-being is not to “find ourselves” or “go within.” It’s to invest as much time and effort as we can into nurturing the relationships we have with the people in our lives.

Given all that, the next time you have the choice between meditating and sitting in a bar with your friends complaining about meditation class, you should probably seriously consider going to the bar, no matter what your happiness app says.",Happiness Is Other People,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/happiness-is-other-people.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

Today’s Theme

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

While it may not necessarily be my magnum opus, this is my favorite puzzle I’ve ever created. That’s because the puzzle is me*.

I graduated from U.V.A.’s engineering school this past May, though I was an ECON MAJOR as well. CHOCO TACO as a crossword entry feels animated yet quirky, and that about sums me up. LEFT BRAIN? My right brain doesn’t exist. LOGARITHM? I’m a numbers guy. ATTIC DOOR? Eh, I’m weird and have my flaws, I suppose. I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed making this thing, but like talking about myself, it just feels awkward. I guess it’s worth noting that on top of everything else, this is my first true crossword publication since I became the Times’ new assistant puzzles editor!

2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horror’s rise at the box office over the decades. This year, led by “It” and “Get Out,” really has outpaced all others. Image Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) in ""It,"" which has been a smash success at the box office. Credit Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.

This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves. Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror. Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo . The runaway success of “ It ” (more than $300 million and counting) and “ Get Out ” ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally. “Happy Death Day” was No. 1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit “Saw” franchise, “Jigsaw” (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.

How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades? Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genre’s rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade. Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie. He tried to bring some clarity with a new list. “When ‘It’ came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo,” he wrote in an email. “That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.”

We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror. Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn “The Exorcist” into a $983 million earner).

The 1970s

Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million

In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of “The Exorcist” in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade. (This figure includes box office receipts from the film’s later rereleases. We went with lifetime grosses in this analysis for consistency’s sake.) That movie aside, horror didn’t make much of an impression that year. And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal. The popularity of “Halloween” in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force. And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of “The Amityville Horror” ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of “Alien” ($80.9 million). That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.

The 1980s

Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million

The slasher genre came into its own in the ’80s, with the introduction of Jason in “Friday the 13th” (1980) and Freddy in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for “Friday” and $370.5 million for “Elm Street”). 1987 was one of the decade’s most profitable. “Elm Street” was in its third installment ($44 million), “The Lost Boys” added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of “Predator” (a movie that probably wouldn’t have existed without the success of “Alien”) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).

The 1990s

Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million

The early part of the ’90s saw few major horror blockbusters. Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late ’80s as the reason for the dip. In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video. “A B-side horror film like ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’ might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late ’80s or early ’90s,” he said. “It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.” Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the “Scream” franchise ($331.7 million). And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via “The Blair Witch Project,” a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.

The Aughts

Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million

The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of “Scream” popularity. While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody “Scary Movie” pulled in $157 million. (It ranked No. 9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama “What Lies Beneath” at No. 10.) Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the “Saw” films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far. And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend. 2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of “Friday the 13th,” a sequel to a reboot of “Halloween” and the sixth entry in the “Saw” series. But the jaw-dropper that year was“Paranormal Activity.” A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.

2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (“Get Out,” “Split,” “Happy Death Day”). But the biggest story is the tremendous run of “It.” That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform. Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend. The real number was $123 million. He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title. “When it came to ‘It,’” Mr. Loria said, “it was just really difficult to track the word ‘It’ across social media to get the snapshot we needed.”",2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/top-horror-movies-box-office-it-get-out.html

[ Read our refresher on where “Stranger Things” Season 1 left off. ]","The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first season’s conflicts. Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.

Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will’s D&D buddies — Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) — find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine’s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).

The new season’s biggest strength is how it deals with Will’s trauma. He’s a frail kid who’s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn’t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show’s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder’s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.

For a breakout hit, “Stranger Things 2” mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show’s teen characters for much of the season), but they’re grounded in the story and characters.

And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown’s transfixing stare, into “The Eleven Show.”

“Stranger Things” has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyce’s amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates. Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though it’s made out of movies. Parts of the new season recall “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Gremlins,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and, naturally, the Reese’s Pieces sequence in “E.T.” For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes “The Outsiders,” complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.

When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there’s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of ’80s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. “No one wants to be Winston!” he says. “He joined the team super late, he’s not funny and he’s not even a scientist.”

The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he’s made up a story. “I really liked it,” she says. “I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.”

That would be a fair critique of “Stranger Things 2,” which reprises many of Season 1’s arcs and twists. (The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by — well, you’ll see.) I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.

But it’s a still a good time, it’s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of ’80s horror with the heart of an ’80s teen romance. It may be last year’s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn’t mean it can’t still be sweet.

They had tethered their barking dog to a stake and hung a set of prayer flags from the open trunk of their S.U.V., but now they were packing up — silently at first, and then with hard, fighting words.

I shut my door and pretended I couldn’t hear.

They could see me as clearly as I saw them, though, and when I looked at myself through their eyes, I saw a person who couldn’t possibly be having a good time. My aloneness eclipsed everything else about me; I lacked even the company of a series of “thinking of you” texts to convince me otherwise.

I felt conspicuous, as odd and unsettling as a mermaid in the desert. I felt queer.

It was a feeling that had chased me all year, first at an orientation event for new faculty at the college where I had begun to teach. “Let’s get to know each other,” our leader had said. “Tell everyone about your hobbies and your partners.”

I joined in congratulating the business professor on his summer wedding even as I worried about what I would say. The request accommodated varying sexualities but left the possibility of singlehood unacknowledged.

“I’m single and I like long bike rides,” I finally declared, wondering if these strangers pitied me or if they saw my singlehood as the sign of something unpleasant and uncooperative. I had considered “happily single” but knew the emphasis would ring false — no reason to emphasize unless you had something to defend.

Later, when new friends in that town effused about having me over for dinner but failed to follow through, I felt queer again. I suspected they felt awkward inviting me when everyone else would arrive in twos. I was the only single person among 11 at a dinner I did attend.

When I heard of an acquaintance who, running for local office, worried that her singlehood made her untrustworthy in voters’ eyes, I could empathize. There was something queer about being single: queer in the sense of “strange,” yes, but also in the sense that connotes a threat to the conventions around which most people arrange their lives.

Before the call dropped with my newly separated friend, we had been talking about shame.

“I’m so old to be single and so young to be divorced,” she said. “What will people think?” Her husband had been abusive and she knew she would be better off, but she still feared that something was wrong with her for not making the relationship work.

The shame of having “failed” at marriage isn’t unlike the “failure” of being single, if you consider the congratulations offered newlyweds the sign of a universal goal achieved.

Mine was a shame I only recently had begun to inspect. How much of the feeling arose from my own desire to couple up, and how much from the sense that, by not doing so, I was confounding family and friends? How much came from the suspicion that, when colleagues asked whether my new apartment was spacious enough, they were actually wondering if I lived alone — but found the prospect too tragic to name?

Shame, after all, is pain with a twist: It shows us more about the communities we live in and the stories we tell than about ourselves. What my own shame revealed was a desire to conform. And when I viewed singlehood as akin to queerness, I felt grateful for the queer community’s reminder that convention shouldn’t dictate how relationships are defined. The opposite of shame, of course, is pride.

“When I was a young person coming out, it was like I signed up for this crazy, marginal life,” a lesbian in her 50s once told me. She is married now and rarely feels queer. Her sexuality hasn’t changed, but her life had mainstreamed.

The history and the present of queer people’s marginalization are far more severe, but the strides they have taken toward having their lives recognized are proportionally as vast. Meanwhile, queer or not, single people are treated with a mild exclusion and a bafflement that feels centuries past.

Maybe this is because, unlike the identity categories under the umbrella of queerness, singlehood can be elected or cast aside. As a result, and especially if you’re a childless white woman in her 30s, like me, singlehood is a state people assume you are trying to flee. For years, without reflection, I made the same assumption about myself.

How could I not, when even the Supreme Court would declare, with the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, that to be unmarried was to be “condemned to live in loneliness”? The pathos typically associated with singlehood is that severe.

But if I wanted coupledom as badly as I have been led to believe I must, I’m pretty sure I would have dated more intensively and made bigger compromises. Strangers may refer to me as “still” single, as though I suffer from a persistent disease, but some part of me must love the life I lead.

To call the unmarried “lonely” is to pretend that marriage confers companionship, not merely a set of privileges historically reserved for long-term companions. But the longer I have been single, the more I have devoted myself to companionship in the form of close friendships that enrich my life. Thriving as a single person doesn’t challenge conventions of gender or sexuality, but it does contest the notion that romantic partnerships must take precedence over other relationships.

I have a long-married friend who used to question why I lived alone until we realized that to do so without questioning why she lived with a partner was unfair. Another friend reminds me that to reclaim singlehood the way queer people once reclaimed “queer” is a means of seizing power.

Even when doing so is an attempt to console yourself, as you sit frightened and alone, in an endless desert, under a sudden hailstorm, trapped in the bubble of your car.

Or later, when you have to relearn — as I would after the end of the relationship I was in then — that owning singlehood doesn’t just mean staring down others’ discomfort; it also means facing the fear and pity in yourself.

First step: Get out of the car.

It had stopped hailing. The couple had driven away. There was a steaming hot-spring pool to warm up in and a bathhouse whose two hot-spring showers ran continuously.

Inside, I discovered I could lock the door. The huge space was mine alone, but when I peeled off my bathing suit and searched for my reflection in the mirrored wall, I saw abandoned flip-flops, damp paperbacks and bottles of shampoo — the traces of other lives. Names and messages were carved into wet wood. Someone had painted a heart on the wall, or maybe just a big kidney bean.

It would be a lie to say I didn’t crave the heat of another body in that space. Contrary to what the Supreme Court might suggest, though, companionship doesn’t always mitigate loneliness. Loneliness dissipates when you find comfort and pleasure in your own company.

To that end, I suggest a long, soothing shower, in a gorgeous and mysterious place.",Is There Something Odd About Being Single?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/modern-love-is-there-something-odd-about-being-single.html

At the end of what he called “a sad day” for Spaniards, Mr. Rajoy assured them that he had the means to end a secessionist threat that, he said, was based on “lies, frauds and impositions.”

Fueled by a distinct language and culture as well as economic grievances, aspirations for a separate state have percolated for generations in Catalonia before boiling over this month.

The events on Friday, coming in the chaotic aftermath of an Oct. 1 independence referendum in Catalonia, were greeted variously with anger, concern and elation on both sides, with the prospect of even more volatile confrontations in days ahead as the Spanish government moves to put the steps in place.

Spain’s attorney general may now seek to detain Catalan leaders on grounds of rebellion.

Such moves were likely to turn the boisterous separatist street celebrations that greeted the independence declaration on Friday into mass protests, with one Catalan labor union already calling on workers to stage a general strike on Monday.

During the debate in the regional parliament that preceded their vote for independence, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as “historic” and “happy,” or else “tragic” and a violation of Spain’s Constitution — perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.

Within an hour, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution, granting Mr. Rajoy extraordinary powers to seize direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including Mr. Puigdemont, the Catalan leader.

In a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had “no alternative” because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was “contrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.”

Undeterred by Mr. Rajoy’s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create “a Catalan republic as an independent state.”

Most of the opponents to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote, which the remaining lawmakers held via secret ballot, aware that declaring independence from Spain could risk arrest.

The final tally was 70 in favor, 10 against, and two blank votes.

Since the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vise of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.

Mr. Puigdemont, a former small city mayor, was trapped between the demands from Catalan hard-liners to declare independence on one side, and, on the other side, the stiffening response from a Rajoy government determined to preserve the nation’s Constitution and territorial integrity.

Despite pleas for mediation, he and his region’s independence bid were shunned and condemned, not only by Madrid but also by European Union officials wary of encouraging similarly minded secessionist movements around the Continent.

European leaders made clear on Friday that they would not be recognizing Catalan independence and would support Mr. Rajoy, as leader of one of the bloc’s most important member states. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that “nothing changes” and “Spain remains our only interlocutor.”

Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia’s autonomy.

But Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist hard-liners who called him a traitor.

After hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.

Addressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, “you will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.”

In front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. “Your job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,” he said.

Before the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that “today we start on a new path” to build “a better country.” She added, “We are creating a country free of repression.”

Catalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.

Marta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid’s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that “it’s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.”

She added, “A declaration of independence won’t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.”

In the streets outside the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.

The Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.

“Most of the people who would have voted no did not participate,” Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. “It was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.”

Walking into a nearby subway station, Cristina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.

“Neither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people’s opinion is,” Ms. Juana said.

Before the Catalan Parliament’s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.

Many were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.

“Spanish occupiers!” was one, a reference to the national police officers who tried to stop the Oct. 1 referendum by force. “Leave Catalonia!”",Spain Dismisses Catalonia Government After Region Declares Independence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/europe/spain-catalonia-puigdemont.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat.","This is not the first time that the Auto Alliance has dismissed the need for regulation. In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument. “We shouldn’t overemphasize the effectiveness of technology,” he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.

The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology. For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.

But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths. And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.

“You can’t teach people not to forget,” said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles. “There is a scientific reason why this is happening. It’s not that people don’t love their kids.”

David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten. Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription. Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.

“The brain process is the same,” Dr. Diamond said. “All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.”

General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing. If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds. The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year. The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.

This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child. Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.

Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices. One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing. The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat. If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.

Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.

When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, “I realized that while my car can tell me that, it can’t tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.”

“We get buzzers and warnings for everything,” she said. “How in the world do you not develop a reminder for what is indisputably the most important thing?”",Forgetting a Child in a Back Seat Can Kill.

During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space — and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.","Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/lord-taylor-wework-and-the-death-of-leisure.html

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Yu Darvish. They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.

The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park. The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.

The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros’ offense. After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games. The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock. Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros’ lineup would hold up.

Plastic bags, which take hundreds of years to degrade, are a major global issue, blamed for clogging oceans and killing marine life. Last month, Kenya put in place a rule that will punish anyone making, selling or importing plastic bags with as much as four years in jail or a $19,000 fine.

In Rwanda, the authorities say the bags contribute to flooding and prevent crops from growing because rainwater can’t penetrate the soil when it is littered with plastic.

The nation’s zero tolerance policy toward plastic bags appears to be paying off: Streets in the capital, Kigali, and elsewhere across this hilly, densely populated country are virtually spotless. Men and women are regularly seen on the sides of roads sweeping up rubbish, and citizens are required once a month to partake in a giant neighborhood cleaning effort, including the president.

Plastic-bag vigilantes are everywhere, from airports to villages, and these informants tip off the authorities about suspected sales or use of plastic.

One recent afternoon, Mr. Mberabagabo, the border official, surveyed the crossing point with the Democratic Republic of Congo, where thousands of people, goods and animals flowed back and forth, punctuated by shouts, cries and animal grunts.

Plastic tubs filled with onions, eggplants, carrots, plantains and cassava bobbed above the heads of women who marched purposefully, with places to go, money to make and mouths to feed. And somewhere among them, often tucked in the women’s undergarments, Mr. Mberabagabo said, were hundreds of plastic bags.

“The most extreme cases are the ladies,” he said. “It’s not very easy to search them,” he added bashfully.

An immigration official working alongside Mr. Mberabagabo showed footage on his cellphone of a middle-aged woman who had been caught transporting plastic bags wrapped around her arms. In the clip, she sobbed and apologized, shielding her eyes from the camera as if she were a drug dealer exposed in a sting operation on television.

The official, expressing a mix of awe and frustration at the lengths to which smugglers will go, showed another video clip of a wheelchair that had a false bottom concealing bundles of tightly packed plastic bags. He puffed with pride while recounting how he discovered the deceit.

Nearby, a tall plastic bin was filled to the brim with plastic bags, from the large supermarket kind to the small, translucent types used to pack sandwiches. A big banner read: “Use environmentally friendly bags” as officials searched luggage and patted down entrants.

Rwanda is probably Africa’s cleanest nation and among the most pristine in the world. Though at least 15 African countries have enacted some sort of ban, many still have plastic bags littered on roads, stuck in drain pipes or caught in trees. Cattle die eating the bags because they obstruct digestion. In informal settlements in places like Kenya, plastic bags are sometimes used as “flying toilets” containing human waste.

There are, of course, many environmental threats on the continent, including poaching, water pollution and deforestation. Some countries are trying to tackle them, like Gabon, where the president has fashioned himself as an environmentally conscious leader. But many nations lack the resources or political will. Congo bans plastic bags, in theory, but there is little to suggest the ban is enforced.

Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, has so much trash, most of it contained in plastic bags, that the city’s residents have nicknamed the city “poubelle,” or “garbage can.” In Goma, a Congolese city just across the border with Rwanda, plastic litter is everywhere, made even more visible because the earth there is made of black, volcanic rock. Clumps of colored plastic poke out of the ground like weird vegetation.

“Rwanda is very clean; here in Congo it’s very dirty,” said Richard Mumbere, a Congolese cabdriver. “Our government is not organized, and so it damages the environment.”

Back in Rwanda, enforcing the ban, which was first adopted in 2008, involves hundreds of rules that are tricky to follow, to say the least.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Imports generally have their plastic packaging removed at customs, officials say, unless doing so would damage the goods. In that case, stores are required to remove the packaging before handing the merchandise to customers.

Food wrapped in cellophane is allowed only in hotels, and only if it does not leave the premises.

Biodegradable bags are allowed only for frozen meat and fish, not for other items like fruit and vegetables because such bags still take as long as 24 months to decompose, the government says.

Potato chips and other foods packed in plastic are allowed only if the companies making them are approved by the government — after showing a detailed business plan that includes how they plan to collect and recycle their bags.

The results of Rwanda’s efforts are evident in this clean country, but they may not be easy to replicate. In the United States and Europe, for example, there is a dispute between environmentalists and representatives of the plastics industry who say that bags made of alternative materials, like cloth, have a bigger carbon footprint than plastic ones and aren’t as environmentally friendly as people think. Plastic bags should be reused and recycled instead, they argue.

The authorities in Rwanda brush off criticism about the absence of similar debates in their country. The rules here are based on extensive scientific research and public surveys, they say. And their enforcement is more easily accepted in a country with authoritarian tendencies and little room for dissent.",Public Shaming and Even Prison for Plastic Bag Use in Rwanda,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/africa/rwanda-plastic-bags-banned.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

You need not be a media historian to notice that we live in a golden age of press harassment, domestic propaganda and coercive efforts to control political debate. The Trump White House repeatedly seeks to discredit the press, threatens to strip broadcasters of their licenses and calls for the firing of journalists and football players for speaking their minds. A foreign government tries to hack our elections, and journalists and public speakers are regularly attacked by vicious, online troll armies whose aim is to silence opponents.

In this age of “new” censorship and blunt manipulation of political speech, where is the First Amendment? Americans like to think of it as the great protector of the press and of public debate. Yet it seems to have become a bit player, confined to a narrow and often irrelevant role. It is time to ask: Is the First Amendment obsolete? If so, what can be done?

These questions arise because the jurisprudence of the First Amendment was written for a different set of problems in a very different world. The First Amendment was ignored for much of American history, coming to life only in the 1920s thanks to the courage of judges like Learned Hand, Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Courts and civil libertarians used the amendment to protect speakers from government prosecution and censorship as it was practiced in the 20th century, such as the arrest of pamphleteers and the seizure of anarchist newspapers by the Postal Service.

But in the 21st century, censorship works differently, as the writer and academic Zeynep Tufekci has illustrated. The complete suppression of dissenting speech isn’t feasible in our “cheap speech” era. Instead, the world’s most sophisticated censors, including Russia and China, have spent a decade pioneering tools and techniques that are better suited to the internet age. Unfortunately, those new censorship tools have become unwelcome imports in the United States, with catastrophic results for our democracy.

The Russian government was among the first to recognize that speech itself could be used as a tool of suppression and control.

The Chinese government has perfected “reverse censorship,” whereby disfavored speech is drowned out by “floods” of distraction or pro-government sentiment.

On the other side are workers who worry that the company’s hands-off approach has already caused problems — ones that will grow worse if nothing is done.

“The algorithms Facebook sets up that prioritize and control what’s shown in its powerful newsfeed are a lot more consequential than the ads,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who closely follows social media and technology. “The company seems stuck between exercising this massive power as it wishes, but also terrified about the conversation about its power and how to handle it.”

Next week, Facebook’s general counsel will be among several tech industry executives expected to testify at a series of Congressional hearings about the role the technology industry played in Russian interference of last year’s election.

Facebook has acknowledged that an organization with ties to the Kremlin purchased $100,000 worth of ads related to the election and has promised to crack down on such advertising.

Since Facebook disclosed the existence of those ads and posts with Russian ties last month, the company has attempted to tamp down fears it abetted interference in the election. It has also added rules meant to improve disclosures of political advertising in an attempt to show users exactly who is behind the ads they saw run through their newsfeeds.

And on Friday, the company began a test of new features designed to give users a better understanding of the people and organizations buying advertising on Facebook. That included providing users with a searchable database of ads being served to them.

But misleading ads were often a small component of the misinformation campaign.

Investigators believe the Internet Research Agency, a so-called troll farm that has been linked to the Kremlin, amassed enormous followings for various Facebook Pages that masqueraded as destinations for discussion about all sorts of issues, from the Black Lives Matter movement to gun ownership.

Aided by Facebook’s finely tuned ad-targeting tools, the Russian firm would pay to place posts in the News Feeds of users. The ad product, called a “promoted post,” was designed to look little different than the rest of the content flowing through the News Feed.

Users who responded in a positive manner to the advertisements were prompted to subscribe to related Facebook Pages or Groups run by the Russians. If they did, it meant that nonpaid, “organic” posts would begin to appear in the users’ News Feeds. From there they spread, being shared and reshared among the user’s network of friends.

The tactic was effective. Some of the pages, like “Blacktivists,” which focused on racial issues, had more than 360,000 users who “liked” the page — even more than the main “Black Lives Matter” page.

Facebook is not the only big internet company wrestling with the issue. But at Mr. Zuckerberg’s company, the issue has been particularly troublesome, given how easy it is to spread messages to tens of millions of Facebook users.

Whether something is removed from Facebook is often dictated by its terms of service, which define standards of behavior on the network. Those standards prohibit posting nudity and threats of violence. But misleading users — even outright lying — aren’t necessarily against the rules. And that’s hard to police.

So far, Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity and identity on the platform. Facebook removed hundreds of ads last month, not because of the content they contained, but because the Russians running the pages did not disclose their real identities.

“We want people to be able to come to Facebook to talk about issues of public interest, and we know that means people will sometimes disagree and the issues they discuss will sometimes be controversial,” Monika Bickert, head of product policy and counterterrorism at Facebook, said in a statement. “That’s O.K. But it’s important to us that these conversations happen in an authentic way, meaning we have to be speaking as ourselves, with our real identities.”

That line of reasoning may not hold up for long, as Facebook is being forced to deal with policy discussions outside the United States. In Myanmar, Facebook is caught between the government and a persecuted minority group of Muslims, the Rohingya, who face a misinformation campaign on Facebook in posts often from top government leaders.

Facebook has said little publicly about the situation but there is intensifying pressure to respond.

One of the solutions discussed internally at Facebook has been “whitelisting,” in which algorithms would decide which content makers would be allowed to publish or advertise on Facebook, according to two people familiar with the company’s internal deliberations. They have also discussed “blacklisting,” in which the algorithms would decide which content makers could not post.

But in closed-door meetings at Facebook’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters and in Washington, Facebook employees have expressed concern that such a move could have effects on other publications and content makers that are not spreading false or divisive news.

Others worry that acting too hastily could establish precedents that would lead to a situation, for example, where human rights activists using Facebook to coordinate protests in Syria would be forced to identify themselves. They also worry that any effort to quash certain content in the United States could only aid censors in other countries.

As for a technical solution, some hope artificial intelligence can help Facebook sift fact from fiction. But today’s A.I. technology is not advanced enough to do the work on its own.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Zuckerberg’s solution is to double down on his community concept. He has said publicly that strengthening social bonds on Facebook will lead to a positive outcome, despite whatever reservations his employees and the general public may have.

“Every day, I say to myself, ‘I don’t have much time here on Earth, how can I make the greatest positive impact?’ Some nights I go to bed and I’m not sure I made the right choices that day,” Mr. Zuckerberg said at the June conference. “I can tell you, those doubts don’t go away, no matter who you are. But every day you just get up and try to make the world a little better.”","At Facebook, Hand-Wringing Over a Fix for Fake Content",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/facebook-fake-content-employees.html

In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours. When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter. Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that “a store should be a social center.” To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.

During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space — and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.","Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/lord-taylor-wework-and-the-death-of-leisure.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

This week, Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the fact that Democrats had paid the firm for the research as evidence that the dossier was part of a political smear campaign.

Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that it was a “disgrace” that Democrats had funded the dossier, calling it “a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”

At the heart of the story is Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm founded by former Wall Street Journal employees. Little is known about the firm’s list of clients, and Republicans in Congress have pressed the firm and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, to hand over documents about the funding and research that produced the dossier.

The Free Beacon’s editor, Matthew Continetti, and its chairman, Michael Goldfarb, said in a statement that the website was not involved in the dossier.

“All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier,” they said. “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”

The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS to research any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, his campaign team and Russia, court filings revealed this week. Working for them, the firm retained Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence officer.

He went on to produce a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos, which became known as the “Steele dossier,” also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, as well as real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

Speculation had circulated for months that Mr. Singer was involved in the dossier, but his allies had denied that. On Friday, an associate said Mr. Singer had not been aware of the dossier or Mr. Steele’s involvement in Fusion GPS’s research until January, when BuzzFeed published the dossier.

Mr. Singer was among the leading Republican critics of Mr. Trump during the Republican presidential primary race. Even after Mr. Singer’s first choice, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, dropped out of the race, Mr. Singer continued to fund efforts to block Mr. Trump from the party’s nomination.

The revelation of The Free Beacon’s involvement with Fusion GPS threatens a rapprochement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Singer, who donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural fund and has visited the White House on multiple occasions. After one such visit, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Singer “was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ‘Never Trump,’ and Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support and it’s all about unification.”

Josh Levy, a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, said questions about who funded Mr. Steele’s work should be secondary to its credibility.

The Free Beacon has a history of employing so-called opposition research firms to assist in news articles critical of targets like Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. In their statement, Mr. Continetti and Mr. Goldfarb said that “we stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods.”



Investigators working with several congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have delved into Mr. Steele’s work as part of inquiries into connections between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including whether they conspired to influence last year’s election.

The Free Beacon’s notification to the House Intelligence Committee came a few days before a deadline set by a federal judge for Fusion GPS’s bank to respond to a subpoena issued by the committee for financial records that could have revealed who funded the dossier.

Fusion GPS had filed a motion to block the subpoena on the grounds that it would “irreparably damage” the company’s business and also “chill” its free speech rights and those of “many others engaging in opposition research on political candidates.”

In a telephone conference with representatives for Fusion GPS, the committee and the bank, the judge hearing the case said that Fusion GPS’s clients have “the expectation of confidentiality.” But the judge added that it was “not to say that the congressional committee doesn’t have interests that may trump those expectations of confidentiality.”

The firm’s connection to Democrats was revealed in a letter this week from Matthew J. Gehringer, the managing partner of the law firm Perkins Coie. The letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research “for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest,” and urged the earlier clients to waive their confidentiality “given the interest in this issue.”

Perkins Coie was paid $12.4 million to represent the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 race, according to campaign finance filings, though most of that money probably went to legal compliance.",Conservative Website First Funded Anti-Trump Research by Firm That Later Produced Dossier,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html

People who study these things have observed a marked increase in solitary “happiness pursuits” — activities carried out either completely alone or in a group without interaction — with the explicit aim of keeping each person locked in her own private emotional experience.

Spiritual and religious practice is slowly shifting from a community-based endeavor to a private one, with silent meditation retreats, mindfulness apps and yoga classes replacing church socials and collective worship. The self-help industry — with its guiding principle that the search for happiness should be an individual, self-focused enterprise — is booming, with Americans spending more than $1 billion on self-help books a year to help guide them on their inner journeys. Meanwhile, “self-care” has become the new going out.

But while placing more and more emphasis on seeking happiness within, Americans in general are spending less and less time actually connecting with other people. Nearly half of all meals eaten in this country are now eaten alone. Teenagers and young millennials are spending less time just “hanging out” with their friends than any generation in recent history, replacing real-world interaction with smartphones.

And it’s not just young people. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time Use Survey shows that the average American now spends less than four minutes a day “hosting and attending social events,” a category that covers all types of parties and other organized social occasions. That’s 24 hours a year, barely enough to cover Thanksgiving dinner, and your own child’s birthday party.

The same time-use data also allocates another, broader category to “socializing and communicating,” a designation that includes not just the good stuff — the heart-to-heart with an adoring spouse, or setting the world to rights with a dear friend over a bottle of wine — but any kind of socializing and communicating at all between two adults, where this is their main activity rather than an incidental part of something else, like working. All in all — and that includes daily bouts of nagging, arguing and whining — the average American spends barely more than half an hour a day on social communication. Compare that to time per day spent watching television (three hours) or even “grooming” (one hour for women, and just over 44 minutes for men).

Self-reflection, introspection and some degree of solitude are important parts of a psychologically healthy life. But somewhere along the line we seem to have gotten the balance wrong. Because far from confirming our insistence that “happiness comes from within,” a wide body of research tells us almost the exact opposite.

Academic happiness studies are full of anomalies and contradictions, often revealing more about the agendas and values of those conducting them than the realities of human emotion. But if there is one point on which virtually every piece of research into the nature and causes of human happiness agrees, it is this: our happiness depends on other people.

Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life, even going so far as to call them a “necessary condition for happiness,” meaning that humans can’t actually be happy without them. This is a finding that cuts across race, age, gender, income and social class so overwhelmingly that it dwarfs any other factor.

And according to research, if we want to be happy, we should really be aiming to spend less time alone. Despite claiming to crave solitude when asked in the abstract, when sampled in the moment, people across the board consistently report themselves as happier when they are around other people than when they are on their own. Surprisingly this effect is not just true for people who consider themselves extroverts but equally strong for introverts as well.

What’s more, neglecting our social relationships is actually shockingly dangerous to our health. Research shows that a lack of social connection carries with it a risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking, and is roughly twice as dangerous to our health as obesity. The most significant thing we can do for our well-being is not to “find ourselves” or “go within.” It’s to invest as much time and effort as we can into nurturing the relationships we have with the people in our lives.

Given all that, the next time you have the choice between meditating and sitting in a bar with your friends complaining about meditation class, you should probably seriously consider going to the bar, no matter what your happiness app says.",Happiness Is Other People,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/happiness-is-other-people.html

Donald Trump is not a problem solver.
“Donald Trump, the president.
Donald Trump, the salesperson.
Donald Trump, the troll.","A few weeks after Trump took office, The New York Post reported that Steve Bannon had identified Cuban as the No. 1 threat for 2020 because he could appeal to Republicans and independents.

“Bannon is a smart man,” smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.

I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautéed frogs’ legs.

But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”

When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent. I mean, I’d rather do it as an independent.” But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban’s neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)

Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?

The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”

He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”

He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.

“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’

“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”

He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.

“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”

Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”

Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.

But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.

He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”

In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.

But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”

I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”

“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)

Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.

Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?

“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.

“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”

He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”

Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.

His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.

Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”

Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.

He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.

“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”

Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.",Mark Cuban’s Not Done Trolling Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/mark-cubans-not-done-trolling-donald-trump.html

Mr. Hill raced toward the vehicle — the heroic agent in now-iconic images from that day, climbing aboard Kennedy’s car.

Mr. Hill did not hear the second shot as he hustled to the first family. He heard, and felt, the third. Then he draped his body over the Kennedys. If a fourth shot came, Mr. Hill resolved, it would hit him instead.

“I wish I had been quicker,” he said Thursday.

Making the Washington rounds on the occasion of the documents’ release — somberly greeting well-wishers, signing photographs of his act, demurring at any suggestion of his bravery — Mr. Hill spent his Thursday in search of something more complicated than closure, less tidy than simple vindication.

For decades, Mr. Hill has hoped for clarity on certain questions: Why did Lee Harvey Oswald do it? What was known about his activities in the months before the shooting?

Mr. Hill has not wondered who, precisely, was responsible for the violence of Nov. 22. It was one man, he said — a single gunman, three shots. He believes he is right not because he guessed right, not because he obsessed over it remotely, but because he was there, a fact that has informed every day of his life since.

There has been deep depression, unshakable self-interrogation, a nasty drinking habit.

It was Mr. Hill who could see the hole in the president’s skull that day; Mr. Hill who supplied the instant prognosis, turning to flash his colleagues a frantic thumbs-down; Mr. Hill who informed Robert F. Kennedy by phone, “It’s as bad as it can get.”

“You have to relive it all,” Mr. Hill said softly on Thursday, shifting slightly in his seat. “But I’ve been doing that for 54 years.”

Traversing the capital on Thursday, Mr. Hill leaned into the introspection, recounting a career spent serving Kennedy and four other presidents — Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

He wondered aloud why the current one had often floated a baseless theory connecting Oswald to the father of Senator Ted Cruz, a rival for the Republican presidential nomination last year.

“It’s damaging to the presidency, to the office,” Mr. Hill said of President Trump’s handiwork.

He held forth on Caroline Kennedy (“smart girl — I guess I should say ‘lady’ now”), Poland Spring water (“Eisenhower’s water! We used to carry that”) and Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime conspiracy monger and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, whose name was invoked on cable television before Mr. Hill was scheduled to appear on Thursday morning.

“Turn to your left,” he told a seatmate in the MSNBC waiting area, apparently willing to offer a candid assessment of Mr. Stone only if cameras could not decipher any eye contact. “Roger Stone. Ugh.”

For most of his life, Mr. Hill, a North Dakota native who now lives outside San Francisco, has been disinclined to discuss the assassination in public. An exception came in 1975, shortly after he left the Secret Service. During a “60 Minutes” interview with Mike Wallace, Mr. Hill said, he broke down when questions about Dallas caught him off guard.

The next several years were spent largely confined to his basement, he said, sequestered from loved ones and drinking heavily. In the early 1980s, a friend convinced him his choice was clear: Change or die. He cleaned up.

By 1990, while in Texas for a conference, Mr. Hill steeled himself to return for the first time to the site of the assassination. He ventured to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald aimed his rifle at the president, according to the Warren Commission.

“I checked everything,” Mr. Hill said. “Angles. What was the weather like that day? Where exactly was the shooter? Where were we? Everything. And I finally came away knowing that I had done everything I could.”

Guilt and shame persisted, he said, trailing him into old age. In 2009, a friend and former agent asked for his assistance on a book. Talking helped, Mr. Hill found. He decided to do more of it.

His own book followed, a tribute to the woman he protected, titled “Mrs. Kennedy and Me,” written with Lisa McCubbin. They have since written two more books about Mr. Hill’s career.

“Very cathartic,” he said.

By now, Mr. Hill said, the conspiracy theories are little bother, even if he doubts that the document disclosure will discourage them much. On one count, though, Mr. Hill has remained vigilant in defense of his president.

“One last thing,” the TMZ emissary shouted as Mr. Hill returned to his hotel. “Marilyn Monroe!”

Mr. Hill cut him off. “That’s a fallacy,” he said. “Never saw her. And I was there a lot.” He ended the interview, stepping toward the hotel entrance, then turning back to ensure he had dispatched the only cameraman.

They stay in motel rooms, often far enough from the events to avoid detection, or on campgrounds after trading suggestions on Facebook, Gab and Twitter.

“My general take is that the number of people who are highly motivated and dedicated to this stuff are relatively small in number,” said George Hawley, who teaches political science at the University of Alabama and is the author of a recent book about the alt-right. “But the ones who are and have the capacity to do so are willing to make long trips.”

Alt-right supporters headed on Saturday to two “White Lives Matter” rallies in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, in Central Tennessee. Organizers chose the region to protest the resettlement of refugees in the area, and to call attention to the shooting last month at a predominantly white church that killed one person and injured several others. The man jailed in the shooting, who is black, left a note that referred to Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

In preparation for the rallies, Occidental Dissent, a website popular among white nationalists, offered recommendations and guidelines on topics including attire (white or black polo shirts and khakis “to make a good impression”) and chants (“Blood and Soil!”), as well as a preview of a private event described as “a time to relax, socialize and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people in our movement after two hours of pro-White activism.”

On Friday, about 20 demonstrators, including Harry Hughes from Arizona, had dinner together at an Olive Garden.

“I come to these events routinely because I think we have a message, and we also look for reaction from the public,” said Mr. Hughes, a member of a neo-Nazi group who said he often adds sightseeing to his trips.

Traveling for such events, he said, was no different from music fans making long drives for concerts.

But it was apparently ideology that led the three men from Texas this month to Florida, where they remain jailed on bonds of at least $1 million each.

They had growing histories as activists who were willing to travel from their homes in the Houston area to support the alt-right, and all three attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly when, according to the police, a white nationalist from Ohio drove his car into a crowd. One of the men arrested in Florida, William H. Fears, had also surfaced at other events, including at least three in Texas, according to news and social media accounts of the events.

A few hours before the shooting, Mr. Fears, who faces a charge of attempted homicide, spoke to The Gainesville Sun about what he depicted as the movement’s newfound aggression.

“We’re starting to push back, we’re starting to want to intimidate back,” he told the newspaper. “We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we’re not to be taken lightly. We don’t want violence, we don’t want harm, but at the end of the day, we’re not opposed to defending ourselves.”

On Friday, asked about the charges against Mr. Fears and the other men, Mr. Spencer said: “If the allegations are correct, then they really did a bad thing. It’s not defensible, to be honest.”

The movement’s most fervent activists are often met by left-wing opponents, like those in the Antifa movement, who have a similar, if more extensive, history of traveling. They normally benefit, observers said, from long-established networks that support liberal protesters, sometimes offering meals and couches to crash on.

Starting with the street clashes in Seattle during the World Trade Organization conference in 1999, “you just see this roving band that was at everything,” said Scott Crow, a longtime liberal activist and author who lives in Texas. “You’re probably not seeing the same Antifa people at every Richard Spencer rally, but there are people who are probably at many of those things or the big ones.”

Federal officials have long paid close attention to activists all along the political spectrum, sometimes infiltrating groups they consider extreme. Yet traveling demonstrators, no matter their ideological alignment, often pose particular challenges for the local authorities, who may have little experience handling volatile protests and limited knowledge about people who come from afar.

Social media platforms and the internet only add to the challenge, experts said. While technology yields greater opportunities for intelligence gathering, it also allows for greater coordination among some extremists who, until recently, would have probably stayed close to home.

“They were geographically isolated, they would interact with others and, on occasion, they would travel,” said John D. Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. “What’s different today than, say, five years ago is that more and more people seem to be self-connecting with the cause of white supremacy versus joining a white supremacist group.”

And experts said a blend of easy access and coordination, as well as perceptions of a hands-off approach to policing past rallies, sometimes draws outspoken activists who ordinarily would have remained “underground.”

On the web page with instructions and guidelines for the demonstrations in Tennessee, Mr. Griffin included an admonishment that “another Charlottesville” is “not in our interest.” Rather, one of the weekend’s stated objectives was to “foster greater unity and cohesion within our own movement.”

“We are going to overcome addiction in America,” the president said.

The designation of a public health crisis, formally made by Eric D. Hargan, the acting health secretary, would allow for some grant money to be used to combat opioid abuse, permit the hiring of specialists to tackle the crisis, and expand the use of telemedicine services to treat people in rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump said his plan would include a requirement that federally employed prescribers be trained in safe practices for opioid prescriptions, and a new federal initiative to develop nonaddictive painkillers, as well as intensified efforts to block shipments of fentanyl, a cheap and extremely potent synthetic opioid manufactured in China, into the United States.

He also said he would act to suspend a rule that currently prevents Medicaid from funding many drug rehabilitation facilities.

“We cannot allow this to continue,” Mr. Trump said. “It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.”

Congressional Republicans as well as law enforcement and physicians’ groups said the president’s announcement was a crucial first step in building awareness about the opioid crisis and confronting its causes and devastating effects.

In a statement, Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the American Medical Association’s opioid task force, described it as “a move that will offer needed flexibility and help direct attention to opioid-ravaged communities.”

“There is plenty of work ahead,” Dr. Harris added, “and the emergency declaration adds further urgency to this epidemic.”

But Democrats criticized Mr. Trump for what they characterized as a tepid response to an urgent calamity, arguing that his failure to request funding for the effort revealed a lack of seriousness about addressing the issue.

“America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half-measures.”

Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, said that no emergency declaration would do much to alleviate the impact of opioids without a substantial commitment of federal money and a clear strategy for overhauling the way the country treats addiction.

“What we need is for the president to seek an appropriation from Congress, I believe in the billions, so that we can rapidly expand access for effective outpatient opioid addiction treatments,” Dr. Kolodny said in an interview. “Until those treatments are easier to access than heroin or fentanyl, overdose deaths will remain at record-high levels.”

Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to a crucial victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year. As president, he appointed an opioid commission in March, installing Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race, as chairman.

In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.

Although Mr. Trump called the opioid crisis a national emergency over the next month, he did not sign a formal declaration of the designation, and the idea ran into stiff resistance in his administration to making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with an issue that has shown no signs of abating.

Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue. They said the White House would soon send Congress a request for money to combat opioids, with the goal of including it in a year-end spending package.

Mr. Christie praised the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out. That includes a “drug czar” to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of health and human services who would tailor policies and identify sources of funding.

Among the questions left unanswered by the president’s announcement is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will use its authority under the public health declaration to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.

Jim Hood, a founder and the chief executive of Facing Addiction, who lost his 20-year-old son, Austin, to an accidental overdose five years to the day before Mr. Trump’s announcement, said he was grateful that the president took the time to talk about a crisis that had too often been ignored, but worried that his message missed the mark.

“That undercurrent that if all of you just decided not to do this, we’d be in a better place — I can tell you, my son did not decide that he wanted to become addicted, much less die,” Mr. Hood said. “We might have been much better served by framing this as a very serious illness, a very serious health issue.”",Trump Declares Opioid Crisis a ‘Health Emergency’ but Requests No Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html

“Suburbicon,” a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock. This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.

The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.

Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”

Video

The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.

Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images.

But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models.
Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars.
The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment.
Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.","Mr. Hackett’s predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.

Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers. It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.

“We are committed to transforming our business,” Mr. Hackett said of his company’s efforts to bring new driverless technology to market. Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.

That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.

It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.

For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid — but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.

Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.

Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.

The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company’s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. “Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn’t make money,” the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford’s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.

But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.

Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement — which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico — could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.

Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.

Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.

Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation’s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.

The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group. But G.M. reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.

G.M.’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated “the resilience of our core business” in the face of declining consumer demand. “This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,” he said.

But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. “The market is more challenging than expected,” Mr. Stevens said.

Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.

The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.

Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. “Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally,” she said.

And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.

“We’re not laggards here,” the company’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call. “We’ve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.”",Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/detroit-automakers.html

A Trunk Show

Luggage connoisseurs will have a field day at Louis Vuitton’s exhibition, “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez,” which opened Friday at 86 Trinity Place in Lower Manhattan. Previously mounted in Seoul, Paris and Tokyo, the show traces the history of the fashion house, founded in 1854, through letters, photographs, sales ledgers, advertising cards and trunks. Many, many trunks.

Spread across 10 rooms, the trunks are filled with shoes, clothes from the 19th and 20th centuries, hats, books, tea sets, picnic essentials and, in one case, an expandable bed. They offer a leather-trimmed primer on the evolution of travel, from yachting to road trips.

Olivier Saillard, the curator, spent months poring over the Louis Vuitton archives. “I didn’t know he left his family when he was 14 years old,” he said. “He spent two years walking by foot to Paris.”

The brand’s humble beginnings seem remarkable against the backdrop of the Hollywood room, where Louis Vuitton luggage belonging to Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Greta Garbo are on display. An adjacent room is devoted to fanciful collaborations, including an oval-shape bag dreamed up by Rei Kawakubo, a twisted box-clutch from Frank Gehry and a monogrammed skateboard trunk stamped with the red Supreme logo.

There are no suitcases in the final room. Instead, there are dresses worn by celebrities such as Alicia Vikander, Taylor Swift and Madonna, a nod to the house’s shorter history of haute couture.

The exhibition, which is open free to the public through Jan. 8, had a preview party on Thursday with a boldface crowd that included Michelle Williams, Ruth Negga and Zendaya. — VALERIYA SAFRONOVA

Architectural Artworks With Crafty Origins

“Wide Wake,” the artist Sam Moyer’s first exhibition with Sean Kelly gallery in New York features paintings, sculpture and drawings in oil on paper — but my favorite pieces are the large-scale paintings composed of repurposed marble, slate and stone — and fabric that Moyer dyed at her home on the North Fork of Long Island. While the materials are organic and hand-crafted, the resulting works are graphic and architectural. Moyer was inspired by artists like Robert Smithson and Agnes Martin, whose influence she compares to the wake of a boat on the water in the show’s title. “ Wide Wake” by Sam Moyer is on view at Sean Kelly, New York through Dec. 9, 2017. – JAMIE SIMS

Fresh Bedding

Bengt Thornefors and Christoffer Svensson met as designers at Acne Studios in Stockholm in 2006. Later they both spent time in Paris, Thornefors working for Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent, and Svensson at Givenchy. Over the years, they had discussed bedding at length — specifically as they had observed the way friends invested in their homes. “Everyone put so much money into their apartments, and we thought if you buy all these beautiful chairs, kitchens, televisions and put art on the walls, why don’t you invest that kind of luxury into your bedding?” said Thornefors. “The bed is such a large object and we saw so much potential for it to be used differently and with more spirit.”

They began to look at bedding as a fashion piece, with the idea that a bed could be well-dressed, and in the summer of 2016 Magniberg launched their first range. The collection combines unexpected textures and colors with a focus on fabrics — an area in which they are self-confessed super geeks. “We want to give the customer an opportunity to combine textiles such as poplin, mesh, silk, sateen,” said Svensson. “The worst thing in the world is to change your bed sheets, but with our bedding, when you put it together you have something interesting.” $60 – $700, magniberg.com — ELLIE HAY

Geoffrey Chadsey’s Elaborate Drawings

Men in Geoffrey Chadsey’s watercolor pencil drawings are hybrids of fleshy humans and curious beings — all emanating from his imagination. “I’ve been collecting photos of men performing their masculinity for the camera, mostly a stoic kind, often awkward because there is a glimpse of self-consciousness going on,” says the Brooklyn-based artist. “These men are performing selves for an online audience — images of being that are presented to be desired.”

His new show, “Heroes and Secondaries,” at the Boston University Art Galleries marks Chadsey’s first institutional exhibition in a decade. Each element his figures clutch — such as an airplane pillow or an iPhone — contributes to ambiguous narratives Chadsey concocts with meticulous artistry and an unabashed ardor for oddity. “Geoffrey Chadsey: Heroes and Secondaries” is on view through December 10th, Faye G., Jo, and James Stone Gallery at Boston University Art Galleries, College of Fine Arts, www.bu.edu. — OSMAN CAN YEREBAKAN

Missoni Teams Up With Jonas Mekas

Jonas Mekas, the avant-garde filmmaker and founder of Anthology Film Archive, is drawn to unexpected environments. At last year’s Venice Bienniale, for instance, he made enlargements of 32 film stills and exhibited them on the windows of a Burger King. “I prefer people’s places to galleries,” he says. So when Angela Missoni — who is celebrating 20 years as creative director of her family’s label — approached Mekas about collaborating on an installation for Missoni’s Madison Avenue store, he jumped at the opportunity. “Why not?” says Mekas, who is 94 this year. “It’s a challenge.”

For the third year of Missoni’s “Surface Conversion” series, Mekas presents “Blue,Yellow, Red, Purple .” The project, curated by the duo Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, includes a video installation visible through the shop windows, enlarged film stills displayed on light boxes throughout the space, and a special, split-screen version of Mekas’s seminal 1969 film “Walden,” which documents moments from his daily life in New York. “The audio runs simultaneously on both,” says Mekas. “So it becomes a very rich collage of sound and image.”

Much of the footage and many of the stills feature flowers and references to the changing seasons. “It’s very colorful,” Mekas says of Missoni’s clothing. “So the theme of flowers immediately came to mind.” A childhood memory of gathering flowers as a farm boy in Lithuania as well as his observations of flowers in New York were points of reference. “The flowers don’t challenge you, they talk to you,” he says. “It’s all for fun.” 1009 Madison Ave., New York. — MERRELL HAMBLETON

A Book That Takes You Behind New York’s Closed Doors

I have a confession: I love to walk New York’s residential streets at night, and look into the illuminated parlor-level windows of beautiful apartments and townhouses. In a glance, you can tell a lot about an anonymous person’s living room — and their world. A new book, “New York Behind Closed Doors,” by Polly Devlin and the photographer Annie Schlechter, takes my curiosity to a whole new level. It invites you into the homes of more than two dozen New Yorkers who live all over the city. There are maximalists and traditionalists, a Memphis mecca in Chelsea — even a Baptist church-cum-home in Harlem. $27, amazon.com — ISABEL WILKINSON

Dozens of other Catalan officials were expected to be fired, but Enric Millo, the current representative of the central government in Catalonia, told Catalunya Radio on Saturday that he expected Madrid to make “the minimum possible” staff changes.

Mr. Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan capital, Barcelona, insisted that Mr. Rajoy was removing a democratically elected government.

“These are decisions contrary to the will expressed by the citizens of our country at the ballot boxes,” he said. He added that the central government in Madrid “knows perfectly well that, in a democratic society, it is the Parliaments that choose or remove presidents.”

Madrid also took control of the regional police force and fired the regional police chief, Maj. Josep Lluís Trapero.

So far, there is no indication that Catalan officials will resist their removal. Pere Soler, the ousted director general of the Catalan police force, sent a letter to his officers, expressing regret over his removal and thanking them for their work.

Major Trapero — who is facing possible sedition charges after he was accused of failing to stop protesters last month from encircling national police officers — also wrote to his colleagues. He reminded them that their task was to “guarantee the safety of everybody” in the coming days, should the political crisis spur more unrest.

As Mr. Puigdemont spoke on Saturday, throngs of Spaniards gathered in central Madrid — many of them waving flags, some wrapped in them — to protest Catalonia’s unilateral declaration of independence.

“We are resisting xenophobia,” one man said into a microphone, before shouting: “Long live Catalonia, long live the king, long live Spain.”

The crowd chanted: “Don’t fool us, Catalonia. You are part of Spain.”

Many protesters said that the Madrid government had to enforce its decision to trigger Article 155. Some said that, if necessary, the army should be sent in, though most said it would not come to that.

“They need to apply the law,” said Chema Martinez, 22, who described himself as a patriot and devout Catholic and wore a Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart of Jesus stamped on its center.

“The army is there to defend Spain,” he said. “They should send in the army to Catalonia; that’s what needs to be done.”

At one point, the Spanish national anthem began to play, and many who had been quietly listening as they sat on the curb silently stood up.

Agueda Rivera, 77, tears streaming down her face, said, “I’m crying. I’m crying for my Spain.”

On Friday, Mr. Rajoy announced that new Catalan elections would be held on Dec. 21, the earliest possible date, in an apparent bid to show frustrated Catalans that Madrid wanted to avoid prolonging a constitutional crisis.

By limiting Madrid’s control over Catalonia to 55 days, analysts said, Mr. Rajoy and his allies were hoping to quickly turn the tables on the separatists, who staged an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

“It’s Rajoy’s attempt to regain the democratic initiative, but also a surprisingly risky bet that he can really beat the independence movement,” said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher.

“Whether it works will depend on the level of resistance to Madrid in the coming weeks, which perhaps won’t be that high given that people are exhausted and need a break.”

Albert Rivera, the national leader of Ciudadanos, the party that has been Mr. Rajoy’s main ally in fighting secessionism, told a party conference on Saturday morning, “We will now come out to beat them, but by voting.”

Photo

The December elections, he said, were an opportunity for “all the Catalans who have been silenced by nationalism,” after opponents of independence mostly boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum.

“We will now claim the right to vote in freedom,” Mr. Rivera added, “to show the world that this is a free and democratic country.”

Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of the Catalan public television station, TV3, said that it remained to be seen how much practical control Mr. Rajoy could exert over Catalan institutions.

“We live in an uncertain moment,” Mr. Sanchis said in his office. “We now have two parallel legitimacies and we still don’t know which one controls the Catalan institutions.”

“The key thing now is to discover what pressure the Madrid government will now exert,” he added. “In the coming days, we’ll find out.”

Jordi Borda, the deputy director of Catalunya Radio, said a crucial test would come on Monday.

“If the Catalan ministers go to work on Monday and manage to work normally, it will be a strong step towards consolidating what the Catalan parliament voted on yesterday,” Mr. Borda said.

“If Monday is a normal day,” he said, “it will be a victory for the independence movement.”

Spain’s attorney general is expected to take legal action against Mr. Puigdemont and other leading separatists on Monday, possibly on grounds of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of as long as 30 years.

Joan Queralt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Barcelona, said he expected the attorney general to act forcefully.

“One thing is what the law says and another is how far the government can act,” Professor Queralt said. “I’ve got the feeling that the attorney general will do whatever he wants, just as happens when governments deal with terrorists.”",Catalonia’s Ousted Leader Calls for Peaceful Defiance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It keeps the breads light. Their subtle flakiness comes from folding the dough over itself, as in croissant-making.

His restaurant, which combines such inventiveness with satisfaction in a laid-back setting, has become a magnet for diners in the know. “I am a regular; it is probably my favorite restaurant in Copenhagen,” said René Redzepi, the chef and an owner of Noma, in an email. “I think Amass is Copenhagen at its best right now.”

Mr. Orlando said that Mr. Redzepi told him that by adding tablecloths, he could get a Michelin star or two. As of now, he has neither tablecloths nor stars, though Amass is listed in the guidebook. Mr. Orlando said he’s stopped thinking about it.

As with his food, Mr. Orlando’s content to go his own way. “The more conservative European dining establishment has not yet accepted rap beats, graffiti indoors, the concrete walls,” Mr. Redzepi said. The dominant color scheme at Amass is industrial, dour concrete gray with iron accents.

The restaurant has a fermentation room, where leftover wine becomes vinegar, and food trimmings participate in homemade soy sauce. The potato bread is made with a starter of fermented potatoes, though home cooks can skip that part. His recipe also recommends saving the potato skins, which find a purpose in the restaurant, though he realizes that a home cook might not use them.

Mr. Orlando is aggressive about sustainability. He helps run local soup kitchens and has classes for children in the garden. “Chefs have such a voice now,” he said. “For a restaurant to mean something, you have to use your power.” But on a day-to-day basis, it’s about using finely tuned taste buds.

And it turns out that it also helps to have a fine recipe that can travel. About a month ago, I was at the Inn at Dos Brisas, about halfway between Houston and Austin. The dinner menu listed steak tartare with fermented potato flatbread. “No way,” I thought, but I asked whether the chef had ever worked in Copenhagen. Indeed, Matt Padilla, the executive chef, had done a stint at Noma when Mr. Orlando was there, and dined at Amass two years ago.

His version of the bread was smaller than the one served at Amass but conveyed the same flaky, buttery, lightly soured character with telltale grill marks. “It’s a great foil for the beef in the tartare,” Mr. Padilla said.

Always helpful to his readers, Grisham lays out the basics simply, including this list: “(1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.”

Mr. Weinstein’s social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died. Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card. “The culture then” encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it. Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way — his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.

When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too. More defensive insult, and from men seemingly indifferent to an internet that swiftly dredged up trouble from their own sexual histories. That both directors felt a need to speak up illustrates an enduring, but misguided, myth of the sexual revolution. We romanticized Mr. Hefner’s empire as a revolutionary force — lovers gonna love, and all of that — but it was actually just a popularization of entitlement.

Photo

In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, we’re seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves. We’re seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.

Mr. Hefner’s disdain for sexual limits fueled fantasies and shaped self-images. He was the Walt Disney of lust — and had his own set of seemingly innocuous iconic animal ears. You didn’t have to read Playboy, visit the mansion, wear pajamas or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing. Women were inferior to men because, for Playboy, they were scenery — pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.

The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on “The Deuce.” Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywood’s imposition of ideas about romance.

The stories that get repeated in plot after plot have become a kind of erogenous pop-culture value system: women as prey, as parts (boobs, bottoms, lips, legs) as often as wholes; leading women but also the “final girl.” A search for full female humanity in Hollywood movies turns up a lot of dolls and dream girls.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values — or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinstein’s words, “the culture then.” The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on “The Deuce” is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful. Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well. But the show’s most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing. But it feels as if it might take forever for their dreams to come true.

The other night I saw “Battle of the Sexes,” which recounts that time in 1974 when the former tennis champ and self-styled chauvinist clown Bobby Riggs baited Billie Jean King into playing a match that became a national political spectacle. It’s not a great movie. Things get logy anytime it goes near a hotel room. (Why don’t moviemakers know that hotel air isn’t quite the same as oxygen?)

But I went home happy, anyway. That’s because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day. (It was also known as “women’s lib” back then.) The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer. Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, “Should she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, you’d have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.”

Photo

It’s true that no one is bragging about how easy it is to grab a woman by her vagina. And Riggs, courtesy of Steve Carell, is a cartoon: loud, bawdy, shameless, mildly pathetic, opportunistically insincere, a little desperate, a jester in misogynist drag. He’s like the villain in an episode of “Scooby Doo” before Scooby and the gang yank off his mask. I would’ve gotten away with it, if it weren’t for you meddling feminists!

And yet the old Riggs’s chauvinism is still out there. Earlier this month, Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers’ quarterback, was asked by a sports reporter, Jourdan Rodrigue, a standard professional question about his receivers and their routes. He didn’t notice her professionalism. He noticed something else: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes.” (The lassitude in his response acquires some lasciviousness for that last word.)

This is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake. “Battle of the Sexes” and “The Deuce,” especially, show how resistant we are to real equality. One dead pimp on “The Deuce” doesn’t end male-controlled prostitution. Systemic inequity is harder to kill. So is the misogyny that fuels it.

The disentanglement of Harvey Weinstein from Hollywood’s institutions has, so far, culminated in the termination of his membership in the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit whose duties include handing out the Oscars. His eviction might address an aspect of the Harvey Weinstein problem. But it doesn’t do much to reverse the absence of women from all kinds of craft jobs; nor does it end the drought of best picture winners that feature two or more women in major speaking roles who also speak to each other. In the last 34 years, that’s happened twice, with “Terms of Endearment” and “Chicago.” We’re talking about a phallocentrism that’s baked into movies and television. It’s the reason we have the Bechdel Test, which asks whether female characters, among other very simple things, meaningfully communicate with each other about something other than a man. Almost no movies pass.

There’s power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things. But there’s different power in the culture now looking at the culture now — or now-ish. The second-season dismount of the Amazon show “One Mississippi” involves a woman’s reaction to an important, sexually creepy male producer. A sensationally complex episode of “Girls” from February — “American Bitch” — puts its protagonist, Hannah Horvath, inside the apartment and on the bed of a famous writer and notorious harasser whom she had visited in order to confront. The best thing about the HBO show “Westworld” is the struggle of female androids to extricate themselves from the limiting fantasies for which they’ve been created. And a major Emmy winner this year was HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” in which a group of frenemies wind up training their focus on an abusive husband. Another was “The Handmaid’s Tale,” on Hulu, about life for women under patriarchal totalitarianism. An idea associated with that show was the same as a hashtag that showed up during the women’s march in January: Resist.

Before this month, I had heard Beyoncé’s “Formation” as a song about, more or less, united, self-protective black feminism. But since the Weinstein news, the chorus sounds more than ever as if it could double as a gender-wide war command: “O.K., ladies now let’s get in formation” — or “let’s get information.” Either way, now I can hear a call for action and solidarity, to be seen and believed.

Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary. That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at “Battle of the Sexes.” This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable. When Billie Jean King, who’s played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater. Actual cheers. I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match. Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.

It also felt dismayingly recurrent. The movie is called “Battle of the Sexes” but only because somebody already took “Groundhog Day.” And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend. But, here, she’s also Sisyphus.

So what now? If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries? How do we reconcile all the complications? “Resist” is one thing. “Change” is something else. Beyoncé is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies. But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.","Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/weinstein-hefner-and-the-poor-excuse-that-explains-a-lot.html

It’s two miles to the east of London’s “Theaterland” but it is a world away from the cramped facilities of the West End’s Victorian venues, with their restrictive proscenium arch layouts. The Bridge’s auditorium is fully flexible. The stage for “Young Marx” extends into the audience; the audience sits on three sides, with seats raked over four tiers. Yet the space feels remarkably intimate, and even the cheap seats — costing under $20 — have decent sightlines.

Critics, lukewarm about the play but effusive about the venue, have been quick to point out the irony of opening London’s first wholly new, large-scale commercial theater in 80 years with a play about an critic of capitalism. Yet the theater is attempting to, well, bridge the usual approaches of the commercial and subsidized sectors in the UK.

For starters, it’s largely dedicated to new writing — a notoriously tricky sell at the box office. Few untested plays open in the West End. New writing can also suffer from a reputation for dry worthiness, a notion Mr. Hytner aims to dispel.

“New writing doesn’t have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing,” he said. “These are new shows that aim to communicate widely. And if we’re ever going to find a ‘Curious Incident’ or ‘The History Boys,’ they’re going to be new things.”

Mr. Hytner also insisted that there is a big audience out there. “They flock to the shows they want to see,” he said. “A lot of them musicals, quite a lot of them not.”

Indeed, a raft of plays have transferred from subsidized theaters to the West End in recent years — including new writing from venues such as the Almeida (“Ink”; “King Charles III”) and the Royal Court (“The Ferryman”; “Hangmen”) as well as the National.

“New writing is always risky, but the work has been so good, audiences are more receptive now,” said Nica Burns, a West End producer who credits the increasing collaboration between subsidized and commercial theaters. “This is why we have such a healthy theater, with so many plays in the West End compared to Broadway.”

The Bridge’s investors seem convinced that if an appetite for bold new plays has been nourished by thriving government-funded theaters and a culture of transfers, they can be originated in a commercial venue in the first place. The £12 million, or about $16 million, construction costs were raised upfront from venture capitalists.

But the model is based on the two Nicks’ experience running a building, and they’re deliberately swerving away from the more usual path of renting a theater.

“A West End producer puts up all the money, takes all the risk, and because there are so many fighting for relatively few theaters, they have to take the terms you’d expect,” Mr. Hytner said. He added that they don’t get the revenue from “the bars, the programs, the ice creams. I know from the National that the profit margin on ice-cream is something you want to keep!”

Owning the Bridge means Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr have the opportunity to rake those retail profits in. But crucially, it also means they’ll avoid the particular pressure of budgeting on a show-by-show basis.

“We don’t have to show a return on every single play,” Mr. Hytner said. “It’s a cash-flow business. That graph can go up and down quite considerably, but if we play at over 75 percent we’re doing brilliantly. That’s not even really a target because if, say, ‘Julius Caesar’ plays to 95 percent it doesn’t really matter what the plays either side of it do.”

Such long-view financial flexibility will allow Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr to program the work they like: “theater which is ambitious,” as Mr. Hytner defines it. And there’s surely another lesson from the subsidized sector: To be ambitious, you have to be able to afford to fail sometimes.

Mr. Hytner is evidently relieved to have shrugged off the burden of overseeing a national institution, however. “Everybody knows what a National Theater should be, what the repertoire should be,” he said. “The fact is that everyone, of course, knows differently.” Now, he is free to do as he pleases — just so long as what pleases him pleases the audience.",A New London Theater Aims to Stage a Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/theater/bridge-theater-london-nicholas-hytner-young-marx.html

But despite this tortured history, or perhaps because of it, the Catalan crisis does not appear to have markedly increased the zeal for Basque independence.
But after a controversial Catalan independence referendum in early October, an opinion poll found that nearly 63 percent of Basques did not want to copy the Catalan approach to achieving independence, while only 22 percent were in favor.

As the secession crisis in Catalonia deepens, attention has turned to the northern Basque region — which, like Catalonia, has its own language, culture and long history of separatism — to see if the desire for independence proves contagious.

Until the 19th century, Spanish kings swore an oath to respect Basque autonomy underneath a tree here in Guernica. But the region’s self-government was dismantled in 1876, and so it remained (barring a brief period of autonomy during the Spanish Civil War) for more than a century.

Even after its restoration, self-government was still not enough for some Basques — including a militant group, ETA, which killed more than 800 civilians, policemen and soldiers in a decades-long campaign for independence that formally ended this year.

But despite this tortured history, or perhaps because of it, the Catalan crisis does not appear to have markedly increased the zeal for Basque independence.

Many here sympathize with Catalan nationalists. But after a controversial Catalan independence referendum in early October, an opinion poll found that nearly 63 percent of Basques did not want to copy the Catalan approach to achieving independence, while only 22 percent were in favor. And while 44 percent hope for greater autonomy from Madrid, just 23 percent want their own independent country.

After over 40 years of separatist violence, many Basques want a timeout from the independence question, suggested Kirmen Uribe, an acclaimed Basque author who writes in Euskera, the Basque language.

“It’s like we’re different planets — Catalonia and the Basque Country — and we have different orbits,” Mr. Uribe said during an interview in San Sebastián, a coastal city famous for its food and shoreline. “The Basque orbit is longer, and the Catalan orbit is shorter. We need more time because we don’t want to break the Basque Country again.”

“It’s a question of timing — we don’t want independence right now,” Mr. Uribe added. “We’re more thinking about cleaning the wounds between us, between the Basque people.”

In Bilbao — the largest Basque city, and where tourism has boomed as separatist tensions have ebbed — the leader of the region’s largest nationalist party, Andoni Ortuzar, said there was no rush to achieve independence.

“Our way is our way, and we cannot change it because of the Catalan situation,” said Mr. Ortuzar, the president of the Basque Nationalist Party, or P.N.V., a conservative group that has led the Basque region for all but three years since the restoration of Basque self-government in 1979.

Instead of fast-tracking a divisive referendum, Mr. Ortuzar’s “way” is to first establish a consensus among Basque parties and institutions about the kind of autonomy they want. Then he wants to present this joint proposal to the central government in Madrid, before putting the negotiated settlement to the Basque population in a referendum.

Even then, he does not expect a referendum on outright independence.

Besides, the Basque region already has greater autonomy than Catalonia, particularly in financial affairs, Mr. Ortuzar said.

If the Catalan crisis has changed anything, it is in the corridors of power in Madrid, rather than Bilbao, Mr. Ortuzar reckoned. The Spanish government will have learned the lesson of failing to engage constructively with independence-minded regional governments, which might provide the Basque region “an opportunity” in years to come, he said.

“The Catalan situation is very grave,” he said. “But it has a good consequence: Madrid has seen the risk of closing the door. And I think that many people in Madrid have seen — even if they’re not saying it, they’re thinking it — that it is necessary to change the state model.”

But the more trenchant Basque nationalists have concluded precisely the opposite.

Madrid’s violent response to the Catalan referendum is a sign of how it will treat any effort to increase Basque autonomy, said Arnaldo Otegi, a leading figure within P.N.V.’s main nationalist rival, a far-left coalition known as Basque Country Unite, or E.H. Bildu.

The experience of Catalonia shows “there is no state to negotiate with,” said Mr. Otegi, who returned to politics last year after spending six years in prison for trying to revive a banned political party linked to ETA. “Catalonia has shown that it’s not possible to democratize the Spanish state,” he added.

This does not harbinger a return to separatist violence, which is now “out of the political equation” in the Basque region, Mr. Otegi said. “It’s not coming back. Forever.”

But it does mean that the Basque government should follow Catalonia’s example and hold a referendum before negotiating with Madrid, rather than the other way around, Mr. Otegi argued. He also expects “a reactivation” of peaceful interest in Basque nationalism, particularly among young people, he said. “Yes, it’s true there’s a fatigue after a long-term conflict — but something is changing in these past weeks.”

Analysts counter that Mr. Otegi says this more in hope than certainty. “There’s no piece of data that proves that’s happening,” said Ander Gutiérrez-Solana, a professor at the University of the Basque Country. “Not in the elections, not in the polls, not in the streets — there’s no big movement for independence.”

Tens of thousands of Basques rallied in Bilbao the day before the Catalan referendum, in solidarity with Catalonia, “but in my opinion it’s always the same people,” Mr. Gutiérrez-Solana said. “They’re not reaching new people.”

Grassroots activists nevertheless feel that something is stirring. Groups of young Basque nationalists traveled to Barcelona on the day of the referendum to learn from separatist organizers there. It was an experience that was “emotional and inspiring,” said Jone Amonarriz, one of the activists who participated.

Ms. Amonarriz, 24, is from the group It’s In Our Hands, or Gure Esku Dago, that has spent the last four years touring Basque villages, encouraging residents to revive a discussion about independence.

“We are sure that in five years,” said the group’s co-founder, Angel Oiarbide, “the situation in the Basque Country is going to be very different.”

Back in Guernica, however, Luis Iriondo voiced what others believe remains the majority opinion.

“I’d like more power,” he said. “But not if it means losing what we already have.”","Tired by Years of Separatist Strife, Many Basques Wary of New Independence Bid",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/europe/spain-catalonia-basque-independence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean?

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

在那次旅行中，她走访的大多数人都感到自己的民族身份受到现在所属的国家的威胁、这个国家在过去曾是他们的压迫者。他们觉得自己不公平地变成了立陶宛化的波兰人，或者是白俄罗斯化了的立陶宛人或鲁塞尼亚人——鲁塞尼亚人没有自己的国家，而其他人似乎都有自己的国家。这本书很有先见之明，因为近几年崛起的政治人士精心培养的正是这种怨愤的、受伤的民族或国家自豪感，从布达佩斯的维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)、莫斯科的弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，到华盛顿的唐纳德·特朗普。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

阿普尔鲍姆写道，甚至在实施灾难性的集体农业生产之前，俄罗斯的新统治者就已“再次遵循沙皇设定的先例”，“他们查封了乌克兰语报纸，禁止在学校使用乌克兰语，关闭了乌克兰语剧院”。1920年代中期，苏联政权稳固确立后，开始尝试一项新政策，就像在苏联的其他非俄罗斯地区一样，给予乌克兰语官方语言的地位，允许出版权威的乌俄词典。

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

The documents were released under a 1992 law requiring all files related to the assassination be made public by Oct. 26, 2017. But after intense, last-minute lobbying by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., President Trump agreed to hold back one last batch pending an additional six-month review to ensure that nothing released would damage national security. Mr. Trump told the agencies that any redactions should be exceedingly rare, given the time elapsed.

“JFK Files are being carefully released,” he wrote on Twitter on Friday. “In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!”

On Friday night, he tweeted that he would “be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living,” adding that it would be “to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.”

As a result of his action on Thursday, most of what was posted on the website of the National Archives and Records Administration was not entirely new. Just 53 of the 2,891 documents had never been released before. The rest had previously been released, with some information blacked out, and were made fully public on Thursday.

That means about 3,000 documents remain secret in their entirety, and about 27,000 others remain partly hidden. Under Mr. Trump’s order, those should be released in full by April 26 unless the intelligence agencies make a compelling case to withhold portions of them.

Historians who have examined many of the documents released this week said they have not found much that would drastically change their understanding of the Kennedy assassination. But these files, along with another batch made public in July, reinforce existing narratives, raise further questions or add additional details and context to story lines that were previously part of the record.

In particular, the historians said, the documents help flesh out the backdrop for the shooting that felled the young president in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, and the blizzard of conspiracy theories that followed.

At the center of the superpower standoff was Cuba, then as now a Communist beachhead 90 miles from the United States and an obsession for Kennedy and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Seared by the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs incursion and leery after the nuclear near miss of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedys spent much of their time in power exploring ways to counter and possibly topple Fidel Castro.

One document included in the July release outlined a proposal to cause food shortages in Cuba as part of Operation Mongoose, the Kennedy administration project to remove Castro from power. The plan called for introducing untraceable biological agents to destroy crops in Cuba, leading to widespread hunger that could set off a revolt against Castro.

According to the memo, Kennedy’s national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, “said that he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear as the result of local Cuban disaffection or of a natural disaster, but that we must avoid external activities such as the release of chemicals, etc., unless they could be completely covered up.” Like many of the plans, there is no evidence that it was ever executed.

The $100,000 plot to assassinate Castro as outlined in the 1964 F.B.I. memo was not a government effort — at least not advertised as such — but an account of meetings supposedly held between Cuban exiles and businessmen with ties to organized crime. There were many assassination plots against Castro in this era, and while people suspected of participating denied involvement when interviewed by the F.B.I., it was noted that Cuban exiles never had a conversation “without someone expressing a desire to kill Fidel Castro.”

The Cuba fixation helps explain the intense interest in Oswald’s trip several weeks before the Kennedy assassination to Mexico City, where he contacted the Cuban Consulate, a longstanding source of curiosity on the part of scholars and theorists. Handwritten notes report a tip that Oswald was accompanied by “El Mexicano,” believed to be Francisco Rodriguez Tamayo, the captain of Cuban Rebel Army 57 until he defected to the United States.

The C.I.A. was so determined to hide the fact that it was wiretapping the Cuban Consulate that it failed to cooperate fully with the Warren Commission that was investigating the assassination. An unsigned handwritten 29-page document, made for a later House select committee, underscored longstanding conclusions that the C.I.A. stonewalled to disguise its surveillance in Mexico City.

“It is indicative of an attitude on the Agency’s part to unilaterally determine the substance of CIA-generated information to be provided to the Warren Commission,” the document said.

Gerald Posner, the author of “Case Closed,” a book that concluded that Oswald really was the lone killer, said the latest documents may not offer any bombshell. But, he said, they underline and expand on the history of that event and that era.

“The focus on what is new in the released files is so intense,” Mr. Posner said, “that sometimes it is possible to miss how richly some of the documents fully develop important themes in assassination history.”","In J.F.K.

Horseman’s Hollow

(Ages 10 and up, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.)

At 7 p.m. that same Saturday, the line for Horseman’s Hollow was full, and devil horns ($3.95 at the gift shop) glowed red on many a head. Ghosts in tricorn hats chased shrieking SUNY students. A local market sold doughnuts and cider. Inspired by “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Historic Hudson Valley staged Horseman’s Hollow on the grounds of Philipsburg Manor, converting the historical site into a colonial town gone mad. Think fewer clowns, more yellow fever.

I followed a lantern-lit trail along the Pocantico River toward the old manor. Signs along the path warned of the Headless Horseman, but mostly it was just nice to be out of the city.

Decapitations were, fittingly, all the rage in the town. “Let’s see how you laugh without a windpipe,” one lobbed-off head barked through planks of wood.

“Welcome to my garden,” a crone beckoned, and I proceeded cautiously, worried she’d push a farm share.

In a dark barn, ghosts in flowing, glowing sheers oscillated like tower fans. A zombie nun stopped eating a dead soldier’s entrails to scream at me, then the dead soldier popped up to scream as well.

“Oh, God,” I whimpered as I stepped into a foreboding temple.

“You’re right,” a satanic figure atop the throne said. “I am God.”

Winding outdoor paths provided a moment to catch my breath before the next hazy tent or demon’s Airbnb. I paused in the cemetery to let pass a woman who had been loudly telling her friend an unrelated childhood story since we’d left the fortune teller’s camp — what is this, the Moth? Pipe down!

Outside the schoolhouse, Ichabod Crane jumped out. “He’s real!” he cried, pointing.

Looming up ahead, in front of the manor, the Horseman sat ominously on a real horse. “No flash!” a handler snapped at the people in the crowd who had their phones out like Justin Bieber was on that horse and we were all in Montclair, N.J.

Back at the entrance, the ghouls entertained the crowd with a Mad-Libbed shanty, incorporating someone’s oh-so-Hudson-River-Valley suggestion: “401(k).”

Blood Manor

(Ages 14 and up, Hudson Square, Manhattan)

At 11 p.m., the line for Blood Manor stretched down Varick Street. Now in its 13th season, this Manhattan haunt caters to an older, clubgoing set — no doughnuts, no cider. Speakers blasted Cardi B while a stilted man carrying a scythe stalked the line and posed with people in front of a step-and-repeat backdrop.

Inside, it was loud and hot. For 20 feverish minutes, throughout 18 different rooms, I fended off attacks from an ax-wielding contortionist, an undead stripper dancing across from, well, a dead stripper impaled on her pole, and a doctor who leapt across his operating table toward me, growling, “It’s just you and me, big guy.”

Glasses were provided for a maze lined with 3-D wallpaper, but for a pitch-dark maze, nothing — just my own two hands reaching out, feeling around every turn.

Back on the street, friends recounted their escapes in excited clumps, while two young women hid from the stilted man under the M20 bus stop shelter.

This Is Real

(Ages 18 and up, Red Hook, Brooklyn)

Ever wondered what you’d do if you were kidnapped? I sure haven’t.

From Psycho Clan, the team behind Nightmare New York, This Is Real simulates a group abduction in an isolated Red Hook warehouse. Only eight people are admitted during each time slot, and everyone must sign a waiver beforehand. Because most of the other times were sold out, I was given a 3 p.m. Sunday slot, a good option in case you and your aunt can’t get into “Hello, Dolly!”

I stood outside the warehouse with my fellow abductees: a group of male friends and a guy who’d driven two hours from Connecticut. Threatening greeters circled us, murmuring, “Introduce yourselves. You will need each other.”

Two of my biggest fears were already being engaged: a broken fourth wall and a bunch of straight guys depending on me for their survival.

Inside we were blindfolded, bound at the hands and led one by one into narrow cells. I wriggled free of my bindings and raised my blindfold just in time to watch the stocking-capped killer spray a tied-up woman with a gas that made her woozy. He ran down our row of cells, spraying us as well.

“You’re pretty,” he said to my neighbor, and, to me, “I’m attracted to you.”

“Thank you,” I nearly purred back.

He hauled the woman out, and we had to unlock our cells and scour the filthy, sparse room for ways to escape without getting caught. Every few minutes we heard whistling, which meant the killer was approaching, and scrambled to hide. I wasn’t fast enough the first time.

“Dead!” he shouted, pointing at me, as earsplitting horror movie strings swelled. (Luckily, you get three lives.)

The boys tore through our room while I tried to look busy. “Here,” one of them said to me, “I’ll hoist you up to that electrical box, and see if you can find anything.” I longed for the killer’s whistle.

I survived the 70-minute ordeal, hiding in a refrigerator two rooms back, abandoned by the others. The greeters, no longer threatening, took our photo for the Instagram page and recommended Botanica across the street for a drink.

“It’s not much cooler out there,” a greeter said, pushing the warehouse doors open.

Oh, right — out there. I took a deep breath, steeled myself and stepped back in.

Brexit came out of an internal argument Britons have been having since the crash about what their nation is and should be.

The crash increased support for the Scottish Nationalist Party, which won a majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011. In 2014, Scottish voters were asked in a referendum, “Should Scotland be an independent country, yes or no?” The no’s had it. But that wasn’t the end of the story because English nationalism had been aroused.

In 2016, David Cameron, the British prime minister, having won the Scottish referendum, decided to try his luck again by offering a vote on Britain’s continued membership in the European Union: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?”

The argument against continued membership in the union was made in terms of national sovereignty. It was not a new argument. When the European Union began its slow march toward a federal future in the late 1980s, Britain balked at joining the process. In Margaret Thatcher’s view, joining a federal Europe meant the end of Britain’s national independence. Britain, because of its size and importance within the European Union, was able to opt out of the foundational arrangements of this federal Europe: the Schengen Agreement, which allows free movement of people over national borders, as well as the single currency, the euro.

Fear about sovereignty did to normally pragmatic English minds what fear does to most minds: It made them irrational. During the Scottish referendum the European Union made it clear to Scots that if they voted for independence they would not be fast-tracked into the union and could not use the euro as its currency. No greater endorsement of British sovereignty could have been imagined. Didn’t matter.

When the votes were counted, 53 percent of English voters opted to leave while 62 percent of Scots voted to remain. Two very distinct expressions of national will, but only one is being acted on.

How much did Catalonia’s decision to hold an independence referendum vote owe to the Scottish vote? Did Carles Puigdemont, leader of the Catalan Parliament, make a mistake in assuming that the precedent of peaceful voting in Britain on Scottish independence meant Catalans could have their vote in a similarly respectful atmosphere?

Didn’t he know that a European Union pledge to respect the sovereignty of its existing members would not intervene when the Spanish government sent in the Guardia Civil to stop it?

The Catalan crisis leads to a final question about nationhood: Can Western Europe’s nations hope to preserve their wealth and high living standards in a globalized economy without pooling their nationhood into something greater?

The beginning of an answer to this contemporary question comes from the past. Around 500 years ago, at another time of political and economic flux, a Polish nobleman, whose name is lost to history, was asked about his national identity. He responded, “I am of the Polish nation, of the Lithuanian citizenship, of the Ruthenian people, and of Jewish origin.”

The answer anticipates the view of Albert Rivera, who leads an anti-independence center-right party in Catalonia: “Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future.”

“I wish I had been quicker,” he said Thursday.

Making the Washington rounds on the occasion of the documents’ release — somberly greeting well-wishers, signing photographs of his act, demurring at any suggestion of his bravery — Mr. Hill spent his Thursday in search of something more complicated than closure, less tidy than simple vindication.

For decades, Mr. Hill has hoped for clarity on certain questions: Why did Lee Harvey Oswald do it? What was known about his activities in the months before the shooting?

Mr. Hill has not wondered who, precisely, was responsible for the violence of Nov. 22. It was one man, he said — a single gunman, three shots. He believes he is right not because he guessed right, not because he obsessed over it remotely, but because he was there, a fact that has informed every day of his life since.

There has been deep depression, unshakable self-interrogation, a nasty drinking habit.

It was Mr. Hill who could see the hole in the president’s skull that day; Mr. Hill who supplied the instant prognosis, turning to flash his colleagues a frantic thumbs-down; Mr. Hill who informed Robert F. Kennedy by phone, “It’s as bad as it can get.”

Traversing the capital on Thursday, Mr. Hill leaned into the introspection, recounting a career spent serving Kennedy and four other presidents — Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

He wondered aloud why the current one had often floated a baseless theory connecting Oswald to the father of Senator Ted Cruz, a rival for the Republican presidential nomination last year.

“It’s damaging to the presidency, to the office,” Mr. Hill said of President Trump’s handiwork.

He held forth on Caroline Kennedy (“smart girl — I guess I should say ‘lady’ now”), Poland Spring water (“Eisenhower’s water! We used to carry that”) and Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime conspiracy monger and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, whose name was invoked on cable television before Mr. Hill was scheduled to appear on Thursday morning.

“Turn to your left,” he told a seatmate in the MSNBC waiting area, apparently willing to offer a candid assessment of Mr. Stone only if cameras could not decipher any eye contact. “Roger Stone. Ugh.”

For most of his life, Mr. Hill, a North Dakota native who now lives outside San Francisco, has been disinclined to discuss the assassination in public. An exception came in 1975, shortly after he left the Secret Service. During a “60 Minutes” interview with Mike Wallace, Mr. Hill said, he broke down when questions about Dallas caught him off guard.

The next several years were spent largely confined to his basement, he said, sequestered from loved ones and drinking heavily. In the early 1980s, a friend convinced him his choice was clear: Change or die. He cleaned up.

By 1990, while in Texas for a conference, Mr. Hill steeled himself to return for the first time to the site of the assassination. He ventured to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald aimed his rifle at the president, according to the Warren Commission.

“I checked everything,” Mr. Hill said. “Angles. What was the weather like that day? Where exactly was the shooter? Where were we? Everything. And I finally came away knowing that I had done everything I could.”

Guilt and shame persisted, he said, trailing him into old age. In 2009, a friend and former agent asked for his assistance on a book. Talking helped, Mr. Hill found. He decided to do more of it.

His own book followed, a tribute to the woman he protected, titled “Mrs. Kennedy and Me,” written with Lisa McCubbin. They have since written two more books about Mr. Hill’s career.

“Very cathartic,” he said.

By now, Mr. Hill said, the conspiracy theories are little bother, even if he doubts that the document disclosure will discourage them much. On one count, though, Mr. Hill has remained vigilant in defense of his president.

“One last thing,” the TMZ emissary shouted as Mr. Hill returned to his hotel. “Marilyn Monroe!”

Mr. Hill cut him off. “That’s a fallacy,” he said. “Never saw her. And I was there a lot.” He ended the interview, stepping toward the hotel entrance, then turning back to ensure he had dispatched the only cameraman.

Experts have long suspected that the North’s arsenal includes VX, which is far more toxic than sarin. The gruesome murder in February of Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong-nam — a brazen killing in a Malaysian airport that prosecutors say was carried out by two women, trained by North Korean agents, who rubbed the victim’s face with VX — has dispelled any doubts that the North has the chemical. Unlike sarin, VX is “persistent,” meaning it lingers in the environment rather than disperses. The mustard gas that drenched World War I battlefields is the original persistent chemical.

Kim Jong-nam’s murder also raises the specter of new proliferation of chemical arms. The fact that VX made its way out of North Korea undetected to another country could indicate that Mr. Kim would use the North’s extensive criminal smuggling networks to secretly assist other nations, or nonstate actors, in obtaining or producing it.

The chemical menace from North Korea recalls a time when chemical weapons posed far more of a global threat than they do today. The doctrine of strategic deterrence — maintaining stockpiles of powerful weapons to keep a similarly armed adversary in check — didn’t begin with nuclear weapons; rather, it emerged from gas warfare in World War I.

In the war’s aftermath, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 banned chemical warfare but not chemical weapons. The rationale for that apparent contradiction was that rogue nations might disregard international law and use chemical arms to attack cities and civilian populations in much the way North Korea threatens to do today. The way to deter such attacks, the logic went, was to maintain a stockpile. If signatory nations suffered a chemical attack, they could then retaliate in kind.

The United States Senate, convinced that the agreement was folly in a dangerous world, refused to ratify the pact. Many nations developed sophisticated chemical weapons programs, as well as biological weapons. By the 1990s, the United States had an arsenal of 27,700 metric tons of chemical agents, and Russia had at least 40,000.

The threat of chemical warfare diminished because of the far greater power of nuclear weapons, but also because of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlawed the weapons altogether. The United States and South Korea are among the 192 nations party to the agreement, and they agreed to destroy their chemical arsenals. North Korea did not join.

After President Bashar al-Assad of Syria was accused of using sarin in 2013, he joined the convention. He promptly violated it with more chemical barrages, including the sarin attack in Khan Sheikhoun in April that spurred President Trump to retaliate with a missile strike.

A similar show of force against Mr. Kim’s regime could have catastrophic consequences for South Korea. The North’s nuclear arms are one layer of deterrence against attack; the chemical arms are a second. Many experts say that Mr. Kim, if attacked with conventional weapons as a warning or a pre-emptive strike, could see chemical weapons as a way to retaliate without escalating to nuclear weapons.

After the Syrian sarin attack in April, Mr. Trump used unusually emotional terms in his speech about his decision to launch the missile strike. “Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack,” he said. “No child of God should ever suffer such horror.”

Let’s hope that the president’s memory of those searing images will make him think twice before attacking Kim Jong-un. The fate of millions of South Koreans within range of Mr. Kim’s chemical arsenal may depend on it.",North Korea and the Threat of Chemical Warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/north-korean-chemical-weapons.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015.
Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.
Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.
For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months.","The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trump’s Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts. He fits the mold of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street. While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.

Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law. Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.

A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.

His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode. Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.

On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn’s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration’s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.

“Justin’s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration’s top domestic priority,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.

Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump’s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.

Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush’s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a “territorial” tax system, as the current plan would also do.

“What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he’s just a policy wonk,” Mr. Bush said in an interview. “Justin has a desire to serve and he’s getting to do it at a high level, and I’m really proud of him for doing it.”

Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve. Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of “America First.” In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.

Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the “outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.”

Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes. In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.

He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinich’s conservative leanings were obvious at an early age. Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.

Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds. His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends. A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.

While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.

“I think that he is pragmatic,” said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department. “He’s looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.”

Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach. Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchin’s promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create. The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretary’s analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.

Yet Mr. Muzinich’s reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“I’m really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later,” said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.

For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months. Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.

The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.

“I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, ‘Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us,’” Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said. “I think people should be caring about other people.”",The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/the-little-known-pragmatist-who-is-shaping-the-trump-tax-cuts.html

Trump, of course, has never apologized for giving comfort to people who marched on behalf of a confederacy of slaveholders. And we all know that race would be an issue if a black occupant of the White House had fathered five children with three women, attacked grieving combat widows and exploited the office for personal gain.

But when people shame fellow citizens with the blunt edge of identity politics, they only encourage the backlash that gave us Trump.

White people who are not privileged — the poor, the uneducated, the struggling — feel belittled when elite whites scorn their “privilege.” What’s privileged about living paycheck to paycheck? About eight million citizens voted for President Obama — twice — and then flipped their vote for Trump. Most of them, surely, are not racist.

What they heard from Obama was the best American music. “In no other country is my story even possible,” he said in his 2008 speech on race. After noting that he won some of the whitest counties in the country, he criticized a view “that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above what we know is right with America.”

To dismiss white concern over busing or affirmative action as racist “only widens the racial divide and increases misunderstanding,” he said. Yet, that is exactly what many liberal whites and blacks are doing now. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his new book of essays, compares gentrification, which comes in many colors, to “a more pleasing name for white supremacy.”

He’s been getting pushback from African-Americans with a more expansive view. “Coates has convinced me that his particular brand of anti-racism does more political harm than good,” wrote Cedric Johnson, a professor of African-American studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, in an essay last year.

Certainly Steven Bannon knows that. He has repeatedly said that the more Democrats talk about identity and race, the more it helps his white nationalistic cause.

If all cultural appropriation is bad — extending even to, say, an Italian-American chef becoming expert in North African food — then we are doomed. If everyone is a racist, then no one can be saved from an awful destiny at birth.

Most Americans now feel their own group faces discrimination, according to a new NPR poll. A majority of whites say that discrimination exists against whites, even though a majority have not personally experienced it.

This is a tragic result of the retreat to tribal quarters, pushed by extremists on both sides. If it persists, the United States that Obama celebrated cannot hold. The breaking point is now.",The National Crackup,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/the-national-crackup.html

Plastic bags, which take hundreds of years to degrade, are a major global issue, blamed for clogging oceans and killing marine life. Last month, Kenya put in place a rule that will punish anyone making, selling or importing plastic bags with as much as four years in jail or a $19,000 fine.

In Rwanda, the authorities say the bags contribute to flooding and prevent crops from growing because rainwater can’t penetrate the soil when it is littered with plastic.

The nation’s zero tolerance policy toward plastic bags appears to be paying off: Streets in the capital, Kigali, and elsewhere across this hilly, densely populated country are virtually spotless. Men and women are regularly seen on the sides of roads sweeping up rubbish, and citizens are required once a month to partake in a giant neighborhood cleaning effort, including the president.

Plastic-bag vigilantes are everywhere, from airports to villages, and these informants tip off the authorities about suspected sales or use of plastic.

One recent afternoon, Mr. Mberabagabo, the border official, surveyed the crossing point with the Democratic Republic of Congo, where thousands of people, goods and animals flowed back and forth, punctuated by shouts, cries and animal grunts.

Plastic tubs filled with onions, eggplants, carrots, plantains and cassava bobbed above the heads of women who marched purposefully, with places to go, money to make and mouths to feed. And somewhere among them, often tucked in the women’s undergarments, Mr. Mberabagabo said, were hundreds of plastic bags.

“The most extreme cases are the ladies,” he said. “It’s not very easy to search them,” he added bashfully.

An immigration official working alongside Mr. Mberabagabo showed footage on his cellphone of a middle-aged woman who had been caught transporting plastic bags wrapped around her arms. In the clip, she sobbed and apologized, shielding her eyes from the camera as if she were a drug dealer exposed in a sting operation on television.

The official, expressing a mix of awe and frustration at the lengths to which smugglers will go, showed another video clip of a wheelchair that had a false bottom concealing bundles of tightly packed plastic bags. He puffed with pride while recounting how he discovered the deceit.

Nearby, a tall plastic bin was filled to the brim with plastic bags, from the large supermarket kind to the small, translucent types used to pack sandwiches. A big banner read: “Use environmentally friendly bags” as officials searched luggage and patted down entrants.

Rwanda is probably Africa’s cleanest nation and among the most pristine in the world. Though at least 15 African countries have enacted some sort of ban, many still have plastic bags littered on roads, stuck in drain pipes or caught in trees. Cattle die eating the bags because they obstruct digestion. In informal settlements in places like Kenya, plastic bags are sometimes used as “flying toilets” containing human waste.

There are, of course, many environmental threats on the continent, including poaching, water pollution and deforestation. Some countries are trying to tackle them, like Gabon, where the president has fashioned himself as an environmentally conscious leader. But many nations lack the resources or political will. Congo bans plastic bags, in theory, but there is little to suggest the ban is enforced.

Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, has so much trash, most of it contained in plastic bags, that the city’s residents have nicknamed the city “poubelle,” or “garbage can.” In Goma, a Congolese city just across the border with Rwanda, plastic litter is everywhere, made even more visible because the earth there is made of black, volcanic rock. Clumps of colored plastic poke out of the ground like weird vegetation.

“Rwanda is very clean; here in Congo it’s very dirty,” said Richard Mumbere, a Congolese cabdriver. “Our government is not organized, and so it damages the environment.”

Back in Rwanda, enforcing the ban, which was first adopted in 2008, involves hundreds of rules that are tricky to follow, to say the least.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Imports generally have their plastic packaging removed at customs, officials say, unless doing so would damage the goods. In that case, stores are required to remove the packaging before handing the merchandise to customers.

Food wrapped in cellophane is allowed only in hotels, and only if it does not leave the premises.

Biodegradable bags are allowed only for frozen meat and fish, not for other items like fruit and vegetables because such bags still take as long as 24 months to decompose, the government says.

Potato chips and other foods packed in plastic are allowed only if the companies making them are approved by the government — after showing a detailed business plan that includes how they plan to collect and recycle their bags.

The results of Rwanda’s efforts are evident in this clean country, but they may not be easy to replicate. In the United States and Europe, for example, there is a dispute between environmentalists and representatives of the plastics industry who say that bags made of alternative materials, like cloth, have a bigger carbon footprint than plastic ones and aren’t as environmentally friendly as people think. Plastic bags should be reused and recycled instead, they argue.

The authorities in Rwanda brush off criticism about the absence of similar debates in their country. The rules here are based on extensive scientific research and public surveys, they say. And their enforcement is more easily accepted in a country with authoritarian tendencies and little room for dissent.",Public Shaming and Even Prison for Plastic Bag Use in Rwanda,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/africa/rwanda-plastic-bags-banned.html

“I always tried to keep my expenses low when I was a dancer, because you kind of never knew when the next gig would be,” he said. “But when I started writing and had some success, I wanted to have a bedroom door that closed, in part because when you write at home as I do, your laptop and your job are always 10 feet away.”

When you move to New York, that’s when you can get a dog, Mr. Federle’s mother always told him. “Instead of getting a dog, I painted my ceilings pink,” he said. The foyer walls were brushed with broad stripes of brown and white; the radiators, depending on the location, with blue; the doors with black; the floor with white.

Name: Tim Federle Age 37 Occupation Writer Sizing Things Up “I was once in New Orleans, and I texted my decorator friend a picture of a giant piece of furniture and asked, ‘Is this right for my entryway?’ And he wrote back, ‘You’re not Belle and you’re not caught in the Beast’s castle, so you’re not allowed to buy that.’”

“I have this dear friend, Nick Olsen, an interior designer who’s my decorating equivalent of a horse whisperer,” Mr. Federle said. “One thing Nick taught me was that if you don’t like the way something looks, and you don’t have the budget to take it down to the studs, paint it.

“I didn’t have the money to be able to say, ‘Hey, Nick, can you do my whole place?’” Mr. Federle added. “But I could say, ‘Am I crazy to want to do yellow curtains?’ And Nick would say, ‘No, you’re not crazy, and this is the yellow fabric you should get. And if you’re getting yellow curtains, paint the back of your bookcase yellow, too.’” Done and done.

Mr. Federle’s rehearsal hat from “Gypsy” hangs in the living room, and a few “Tim Federle” nameplates, once part of the cast boards in theater lobbies, are on display in the bookcase. But the aesthetic tilts more toward midcentury modern than toward mild narcissism.

Evidence includes the turquoise kitchen table and the Finn Juhl armchair that is upholstered in geometric-patterned yellow-and-pink curtains Mr. Federle bought at an estate sale. The chair is as much a pat on the back as a place to sit.

So what I started to do when something great happened was to buy something for my apartment to commemorate that great thing.”

Thus, the Finn Juhl chair — a hosanna when Mr. Federle was cast in a San Francisco production of the musical “White Christmas.” When his cocktail recipe book “Tequila Mockingbird” did well, he celebrated by buying a sofa, an armchair and a rug. And upon completing the first draft of “Life Is Like a Musical,” Mr. Federle bought a large abstract painting at an antiques shop in Hudson, N.Y.

“In publishing, as in showbiz, you don’t know if something is going to hit or tank, but I thought, ‘Well, at least I’ll have a painting,’” he said.

Because Mr. Federle has clocked a considerable amount of time on and around stage sets, he has a sense of compatible colors, he said, and of what sorts of furnishings play well together. Where he founders is with proportions.

“I’ll say, ‘This should be a four-foot sofa, right?’ and my friend Nick will say, ‘Uh, Tim, it should be a nine-foot sofa.’”

Always helpful to his readers, Grisham lays out the basics simply, including this list: “(1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.”

Once Mark, Todd and Zola have figured this out, they realize that completing their studies is a waste of money and time. So they come up with a rebellious idea: Why not start behaving like lawyers before graduation? They’ve seen low-level members of the profession hanging around courthouses trying to drum up business; nobody ever asks for proof that these hustlers have passed the bar. So Mark and Todd begin doing that, while Zola gets the ambulance-chasing beat.

They’ve gone to a terrible school, and their legal training hasn’t prepped them for much.

During the past 60 years, the New York art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare Eddy Thaw, amassed a phenomenal drawing collection notable for its chronological breadth, running from the early Renaissance to the near present. This year they gave more than 400 items outright to the Morgan, expanding and deepening its range.

‘Boo at the Zoo’ at the Bronx, Queens and Prospect Park Zoos

Halloween promises a wild time, and few places do that better than those where wild creatures reside. Each year these zoos host weekend celebrations that educate about animals as well as entertain young humans. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Bronx Zoo offers a Haunted Forest, with both wildlife models and scary apparitions,and the Extinct Species Graveyard, a fake cemetery devoted to a real threat: vanishing creatures. Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, anda costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater , above. The Queens Zoo ’s festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife — meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example — and a haunted trail for people. The Prospect Park Zoo , whose “Boo” runs 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a Spooky Barn, is focusing on bats, whose activities are more helpful than horrifying. And who could resist a dance party alongside sea lions, which are pretty inventive movers themselves? LAUREL GRAEBER

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

To continue this real estate metaphor, sometimes that porch light is not in a place one might expect, so it makes sense to search carefully for it, despite the penalties for trespassing. Some people — I count myself in this group — might know off the bat that the actor LEN Lesser played Uncle Leo on the television show “Seinfeld.” That’s one porch light. Another might be Castor OYL of comics, if that’s your thing. Or G.I. JANE, the Demi Moore film from 1997. Not a pop culture person? Try 50A’s “Six-Day War leader Dayan”: It’s not really a fill-in-the-blank, but you know that’s MOSHE. Maybe you’ve heard of CNN’s ANA Cabrera.

During an acrimonious debate inside the parliamentary chamber, lawmakers bickered publicly on the backbenches as their colleagues made speeches. Pro-Spain lawmakers then left the room after making a final standing protest, during which one loyalist lawmaker also accused the separatists of being “cowards” for using a secret ballot to vote for independence. By the time lawmakers got to vote, it was in a half-empty chamber.

Watching the events unfold on two giant television screens, the crowds whooped as every pro-independence lawmaker voted yes to secession — and booed every no.

Then they erupted with cheers as the declaration was finally made. People cried. Couples kissed. Friends hugged.

But even then, after a few minutes, perhaps half of them turned on their heels and melted back into the city.

Some would return later, and large crowds also filled a small square outside the Catalan government headquarters. At dusk, a smaller group of counterdemonstrators also marched on the offices of the Catalan public radio station to show their support for a unified Spain. As the night wore on, some of them fought with secessionists, and one man was filmed punching another.

Even after nightfall, however, much of Barcelona seemed subdued.

“For now people’s reaction has been to continue with daily life,” said Antoni Segura, a political commentator and a history professor at Barcelona University. “If you compare it to revolutions in the Middle East, where people went out into the streets to express themselves, it’s a very different atmosphere. There is a feeling of: what’s next?”

It was a question that Anna Zaragoza, a 51-year-old civil servant celebrating outside Parliament, did not have an answer to. Ms. Zaragoza described a feeling of relief in the immediate aftermath of the independence declaration. “A lot of tension has gone,” she said. “I felt very oppressed with the lack of democracy. Now I feel relaxed!”

But then she collected herself and pointed at a police helicopter that hovered ominously overhead. It was a reminder, Ms. Zaragoza suggested, of the authoritarian measures that the Spanish government had said it would take to crush the new republic.

A few yards away, other independence supporters were similarly circumspect. “I’m hopeful,” said Aida Gascon, 33. “But euphoric? No. We don’t know exactly how the Spanish government will react.”

Mar Sanfeliu, a 51-year-old economist, had a fair idea — and one that made her fearful, even as she smiled about the declaration of the new republic. The Spanish government “will do whatever it can to avoid independence,” Ms. Sanfeliu said. “I know a lot of people will stay in the streets. But the Spanish government is very strong.”

For many, there was also a sense that this may have just been the latest twist in an epic game of table tennis between the Catalan and Spanish governments in the past few weeks. Both administrations have been testing each other with a series of incremental moves, none of which emerged as a knockout blow. “This doesn’t feel like a historic day,” said Mr. Costa’s partner, Imma Sanz, another independence supporter, on Friday afternoon.

For Mr. Segura, the mixed reaction was also because of the acknowledgment, even among separatists, that many Catalans still do not want independence. While voters in the Oct. 1 referendum chose overwhelmingly to secede, only 43 percent of the electorate participated in that vote.

“People are worried,” Mr. Segura said. “There is a majority for independence, but not a huge majority. So people are worried about the cohesion of Catalan society.”

As if on cue, a few hundred protesters then began to march past carrying Spanish flags. A few also carried Catalan flags, indicating their support for Catalan autonomy, within a united Spain. “I am Spanish,” they chanted. “Long live Spain!”

Fernando Navarro, 22, an economics student, seethed with anger at the separatists. Madrid would have every right to disband the Catalan regional government, and fire Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president, Mr. Navarro said as he marched along. “The Catalan president has broken all the laws,” he said.

And within a few hours, his wish had been granted, as the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, dissolved Parliament, fired Mr. Puigdemont’s administration and ordered new Catalan elections.

Fear can hold people back in many facets of their lives, but it’s especially true when it comes to learning to solve puzzles. For some reason, many people have surprisingly little faith in their abilities, and I wish I could convince them that they know so much more than they think they do and can do so much more than they believe they can.

Aisha Tyler, actress and co-host of CBS’s “The Talk,” demonstrates this by regaling readers of her book, “Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation,” with tales of mistakes she has made and decisions she has deeply regretted. All of these are told to let us in on the wisdom she has learned along the way, and might serve to make people feel a lot better about themselves. Nothing binds us like our shared human foibles.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

So thank you, Mr. Lithgow. I’m a smarter person because of you.

Today’s puzzle — though Mr. Lithgow’s first, it is the 175th Times puzzle for his collaborator, Brendan Emmett Quigley — is a fun and entertaining strut upon the stage of Mr. Lithgow’s life, both the comic and the dramatic.

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch.

The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers.

But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission.

The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.)

The fact that the internet has leached attention and relevance away from television is only part of what’s befuddling this show — plenty of television is premised on digesting and commenting on things that happen online. But those shows — say, “Desus & Mero,” or even late-night talk-show monologues — specialize in personalities and commentary. “TRL” is a mishmash and has the additional problem of trying to build a tentpole television series out of the component parts of internet personalities, who are generally poorly suited to the task.

AI领域的知名人士收到的薪水和公司股份，在四五年时间里，总额能到数百万或数千万美元。在某个时刻，他们还会续签或通过协商达成新的合同，这很像职业运动员。

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

One day after losing a TV gig, a book deal and an HBO project in the wake of several sexual harassment claims, the political journalist Mark Halperin has released a long statement apologizing to the women he said he “mistreated.”

In his statement, posted to his Twitter feed on Friday evening, Mr. Halperin owned up to what he described as several years of “inappropriate” behavior.

“Toward the end of my time at ABC News, I recognized that I had a problem,” he said. “No one had sued me, no one had filed a human resources complaint against me, no colleague had confronted me. But I didn’t need a call from HR to know that I was a selfish, immature person, who was behaving in a manner that had to stop.”

Mr. Halperin said that he took weekly counseling sessions after he left ABC News in 2007, while adding that “some of the allegations that have been made against me are not true.”

In the statement, he also said that his workplace misconduct stopped after he left ABC.

“Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC,” he wrote. “I did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates.”

The move prompted criticism from congressional Democrats, including Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who said Mr. Trump’s push to release the informant from the confidentiality agreement should be a “key part” of the new investigation.

It also drew fire from some legal experts who said that it broke with longstanding norms meant to insulate the Justice Department from presidential interference in criminal matters, particularly those with a political dimension.

“The White House is never supposed to meddle in this kind of thing,” said Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman under President Barack Obama. “That is especially so when there is a political consideration, like if you want somebody freed from his confidentiality agreement because you want him to go say ugly things about a political opponent.”

Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, told CNN on Friday that Mr. Trump “believes, as many others do, frankly, that the F.B.I. informant should be free to say what he knows.” She added, “It is not unusual for a president to weigh in.”

Republicans have long tried to link Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s rival as the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, to the uranium deal, which occurred while she was secretary of state. The agreement required the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, on which the State Department has a voting seat.

Republicans have made unproven allegations that Mrs. Clinton was part of a quid pro quo in which the Clinton Foundation received donations in exchange for supporting the deal. Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and State Department officials have denied that she was involved in the decision, and said that all other members of the committee had signed on regardless.

In recent weeks, the issue has been revived by The Hill newspaper. It reported that before the deal was completed, the F.B.I. had gathered evidence that Russian officials were engaged in bribery, extortion and money laundering to expand Moscow’s nuclear interests in the United States, and had specifically sought access to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, through contributions to the foundation that bears their name.

“I think the uranium sale to Russia and the way it was done — so underhanded, with tremendous amounts of money being passed — I actually think that’s Watergate, modern age,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday.

At the same time, the president has worked to shift the focus from his campaign’s dealings with Russia to those of Mrs. Clinton’s, after it was revealed that her presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in a dossier made public in January that contained salacious claims about connections among Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump,” he said in a Twitter post on Friday. “Was collusion with HC!”

Brexit came out of an internal argument Britons have been having since the crash about what their nation is and should be.

The crash increased support for the Scottish Nationalist Party, which won a majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011. In 2014, Scottish voters were asked in a referendum, “Should Scotland be an independent country, yes or no?” The no’s had it. But that wasn’t the end of the story because English nationalism had been aroused.

In 2016, David Cameron, the British prime minister, having won the Scottish referendum, decided to try his luck again by offering a vote on Britain’s continued membership in the European Union: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?”

The argument against continued membership in the union was made in terms of national sovereignty. It was not a new argument. When the European Union began its slow march toward a federal future in the late 1980s, Britain balked at joining the process. In Margaret Thatcher’s view, joining a federal Europe meant the end of Britain’s national independence. Britain, because of its size and importance within the European Union, was able to opt out of the foundational arrangements of this federal Europe: the Schengen Agreement, which allows free movement of people over national borders, as well as the single currency, the euro.

Fear about sovereignty did to normally pragmatic English minds what fear does to most minds: It made them irrational. During the Scottish referendum the European Union made it clear to Scots that if they voted for independence they would not be fast-tracked into the union and could not use the euro as its currency. No greater endorsement of British sovereignty could have been imagined. Didn’t matter.

When the votes were counted, 53 percent of English voters opted to leave while 62 percent of Scots voted to remain. Two very distinct expressions of national will, but only one is being acted on.

How much did Catalonia’s decision to hold an independence referendum vote owe to the Scottish vote? Did Carles Puigdemont, leader of the Catalan Parliament, make a mistake in assuming that the precedent of peaceful voting in Britain on Scottish independence meant Catalans could have their vote in a similarly respectful atmosphere?

Didn’t he know that a European Union pledge to respect the sovereignty of its existing members would not intervene when the Spanish government sent in the Guardia Civil to stop it?

The Catalan crisis leads to a final question about nationhood: Can Western Europe’s nations hope to preserve their wealth and high living standards in a globalized economy without pooling their nationhood into something greater?

The beginning of an answer to this contemporary question comes from the past. Around 500 years ago, at another time of political and economic flux, a Polish nobleman, whose name is lost to history, was asked about his national identity. He responded, “I am of the Polish nation, of the Lithuanian citizenship, of the Ruthenian people, and of Jewish origin.”

The answer anticipates the view of Albert Rivera, who leads an anti-independence center-right party in Catalonia: “Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future.”

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

It seemed like there was more to this narrative. I decided to learn as many as possible of the stories of the girls who had been sent on suicide missions and then found a way out. I interviewed 18 of them for Thursday’s article, with photos of the girls by Adam Ferguson.

My amazing fixer and I consulted aid workers and security forces, who helped us locate the girls during two separate reporting trips to Maiduguri. Finding a safe place to interview and photograph them would be a challenge regardless of the topic. Maiduguri is a bustling city — full of teahouses, meat stalls and busy people going about their day — that feels a lot safer than it probably is. And foreign journalists draw a lot of attention.

We were at risk, but we were especially worried about the girls. If Boko Haram found out these girls had failed to detonate their bombs, they could possibly be killed. And if regular people discovered they had spent time with Boko Haram, even as hostages, they could be stigmatized as sympathizers. We settled on a quiet park, a hotel room, an empty restaurant.

Adam’s job was particularly difficult. Imagine being tasked with taking portraits of girls whose faces, we felt, should not be shown?

The girls did not request anonymity, but based on the advice of our local fixer, we obscured their faces and did not use their full names. The girls seemed relieved to have the chance to tell their stories.

I knew from my experience reporting on the insurgency that these girls had been through a string of horrible circumstances, beginning with their capture. Some had family members killed before their eyes. Fighters stuck one girl in a room with corpses, and when militants asked about her strength, she presumed they wanted her to clear the bodies. But they wanted her to carry a bomb.

Far from willing participants, each girl said that the armed militants had forcibly tied the bombs to them — many times after they had refused to have sex with their captors.

I tried to get the girls to explain their suicide missions. “What happened when Boko Haram told you to carry a bomb?” I asked. Their stories flowed.

Every one of the 18 had a narrative worthy of a dissertation on the horrors of war. Some of the girls cried as they recalled their terror. Some told their stories in squeaky voices that revealed their young age. Others were fierce, proud of how they had saved lives by not carrying out their missions.

As a reporter, my job isn’t to take sides. But I couldn’t stop myself from believing these girls were heroes. Think of the lives they saved by not detonating a hidden bomb at a crowded marketplace or manned checkpoint as they had been ordered to do.

I asked the Nigerian military whether bomber girls who surrender themselves are rewarded. Why not give them cash? Why not offer scholarships?

A military spokesman said girls who surrender their bombs are celebrated. But that wasn’t the case for any of the girls with whom I talked. After they surrendered, each had been detained, some for months, while officials tried to determine whether they were loyal to Boko Haram. I asked each girl at the end of her interview what she wanted to be when she grew up. They were still mostly children, after all, and I thought that ending with a question that focused them on the future might leave them with a sense of hope. One of the girls told me she was desperate to go back to school; the war had interrupted her education. Eventually, she wants to become a lawyer. “I want to fight for people’s rights,” she said.","18 Escaped Girls, 18 Interviews",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/insider/boko-haram-suicide-bombers.html

Critics have raised questions about why the power authority opted not to request aid from mainland utilities after Hurricane Maria struck the territory, knocking out power to almost all customers, on Sept. 20. After natural disasters, power companies on the mainland often get help from other companies under mutual-aid agreements.

Officials with the Puerto Rican utility have said that contractors are reluctant to work with it because it is under bankruptcy protection. They said that Whitefish, a two-year-old company that had only two full-time employees until last month, won the contract because it was willing to do the work and react quickly.

The contract, awarded on Sept. 26 and amended this month, specifies a handful of transmission lines to be repaired by Whitefish. It also lets the power authority determine how much more work to give the company, which would hand off many of the jobs to subcontractors. On Sept. 28, FEMA put the Army Corps of Engineers in charge of repairing Puerto Rico’s grid and hiring contractors, which could sharply curtail the role of the power authority.

Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Mont., home of Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary and former member of Congress. Mr. Zinke and Andy Techmanski, the chief executive of Whitefish Energy, know each other, and the secretary’s son worked on a Whitefish job over the summer. Both the company and the Interior Department say the connections had nothing to do with Whitefish’s getting the Puerto Rico contract.

On Friday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “This is a contract that was determined by the local authorities in Puerto Rico, not something that the federal government played a role in.”

She said Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zinke, during a private meeting at the White House, whether he had been involved. Mr. Zinke told the president that, “the federal government, and specifically he, had nothing to do with this,” Ms. Sanders added.

Fueled by a distinct language and culture as well as economic grievances, aspirations for a separate state have percolated for generations in Catalonia before boiling over this month.

The events on Friday, coming in the chaotic aftermath of an Oct. 1 independence referendum in Catalonia, were greeted variously with anger, concern and elation on both sides, with the prospect of even more volatile confrontations in days ahead as the Spanish government moves to put the steps in place.

Spain’s attorney general may now seek to detain Catalan leaders on grounds of rebellion.

Such moves were likely to turn the boisterous separatist street celebrations that greeted the independence declaration on Friday into mass protests, with one Catalan labor union already calling on workers to stage a general strike on Monday.

During the debate in the regional parliament that preceded their vote for independence, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as “historic” and “happy,” or else “tragic” and a violation of Spain’s Constitution — perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.

Within an hour, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution, granting Mr. Rajoy extraordinary powers to seize direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including Mr. Puigdemont, the Catalan leader.

In a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had “no alternative” because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was “contrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.”

Undeterred by Mr. Rajoy’s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create “a Catalan republic as an independent state.”

Most of the opponents to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote, which the remaining lawmakers held via secret ballot, aware that declaring independence from Spain could risk arrest.

The final tally was 70 in favor, 10 against, and two blank votes.

Since the referendum, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vise of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.

Mr. Puigdemont, a former small city mayor, was trapped between the demands from Catalan hard-liners to declare independence on one side, and, on the other side, the stiffening response from a Rajoy government determined to preserve the nation’s Constitution and territorial integrity.

Despite pleas for mediation, he and his region’s independence bid were shunned and condemned, not only by Madrid but also by European Union officials wary of encouraging similarly minded secessionist movements around the Continent.

European leaders made clear on Friday that they would not be recognizing Catalan independence and would support Mr. Rajoy, as leader of one of the bloc’s most important member states. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that “nothing changes” and “Spain remains our only interlocutor.”

Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia’s autonomy.

But Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist hard-liners who called him a traitor.

After hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.

Addressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, “you will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.”

In front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. “Your job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,” he said.

Before the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that “today we start on a new path” to build “a better country.” She added, “We are creating a country free of repression.”

Catalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.

Marta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid’s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that “it’s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.”

She added, “A declaration of independence won’t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.”

In the streets outside the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.

The Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.

“Most of the people who would have voted no did not participate,” Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. “It was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.”

Walking into a nearby subway station, Cristina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.

“Neither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people’s opinion is,” Ms. Juana said.

Before the Catalan Parliament’s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.

Many were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The Emmy-award winning actor John Lithgow does not have a favorite word, he says, because he loves too many of them to narrow the choice down to a single one. When pressed, he comes up with “eldritch,” an intriguing word that means sinister and eerie, and which seems to have made a kind of comeback in the 20th century.

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, our editor Will Shortz is running a series of crossword collaborations between people of note and popular Times constructors, and today it is Mr. Lithgow’s turn to make a different kind of debut. Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

Yet some of the Democrats who funded the dossier have been leery about being associated with it. The lead Perkins Coie lawyer representing both the campaign and the D.N.C., Marc Elias, pushed back earlier this year when asked whether his firm was the client for the dossier, whether he possessed it before the election and whether he was involved in efforts to encourage media outlets to write about its contents.

On Tuesday, the veteran Democratic consultant Anita Dunn, who is working with Perkins Coie, explained Mr. Elias’s earlier response. “Obviously, he was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point, and should perhaps have ‘no commented’ more artfully,” Ms. Dunn wrote in an email.

Is this sort of research common or legal?

Campaigns and party committees frequently pay companies to assemble what’s known in politics as opposition research — essentially damaging information about their opponents — and nothing is illegal about the practice.

However, Republicans and campaign watchdogs have accused the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. of violating campaign finance laws by disguising the payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. Their disclosure reports do not list any payments from the Clinton campaign or the D.N.C. to Fusion GPS. They do list a total of $12.4 million in payments to Perkins Coie, but that’s almost entirely for legal consulting, with only one payment — of $66,500 — for “research consulting” from the D.N.C.

In a complaint filed with the F.E.C. on Wednesday, the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group that urges stricter enforcement of election laws, alleged that “at least some of those payments were earmarked for Fusion GPS, with the purpose of conducting opposition research on Donald Trump.” The complaint asserts that the failure to list the ultimate purpose of that money “undermined the vital public information role that reporting is intended to serve.”

Graham M. Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, called the complaint “patently baseless,” in part because, he said, the research was done “to support the provision of legal services, and payments made by vendors to sub-vendors are not required to be disclosed in circumstances like this.”

Who else knew about Mr. Steele’s research during the campaign?

Officials from the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. have said they were unaware that Perkins Coie facilitated the research on their behalf, even though the law firm was using their money to pay for it. Even Mrs. Clinton only found about Mr. Steele’s research after Buzzfeed published the dossier, according to two associates who discussed the matter with her. They said that she was disappointed that the research — as well as the fact that the F.B.I. was looking into connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia — was not made public before Election Day.

But word of the memos and their contents had circulated in Washington political and media circles before the election. In British court filings, Mr. Steele’s lawyers said that he and Fusion GPS briefed journalists from a range of media outlets, including The New York Times, on his research starting in September of 2016.

Yet the research and even the existence of the dossier were not reported by the media, with the exception of Mother Jones magazine, which published a story in the days before the election that described the dossier, its origin and significance, while omitting the salacious claims.

How much of the dossier has been substantiated?

There has been no public corroboration of the salacious allegations against Mr. Trump, nor of the specific claims about coordination between his associates and the Russians. In fact, some of those claims have been challenged with supporting evidence. For instance, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, produced his passport to rebut the dossier’s claim that he had secret meetings in Prague with a Russian official last year.

Where does the dossier fit in with the government’s Russia investigations?

James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whose firing by Mr. Trump prompted the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department’s Russia investigation, received a copy of the memos after Election Day from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. McCain had dispatched David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official, to obtain the dossier directly from Mr. Steele. And before Election Day, the F.B.I. reached an agreement to pay Mr. Steele to continue his research, though that plan was scrapped after the dossier was published. During the presidential transition, senior American intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama on the dossier.

This week, Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the fact that Democrats had paid the firm for the research as evidence that the dossier was part of a political smear campaign.

Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that it was a “disgrace” that Democrats had funded the dossier, calling it “a very sad commentary on politics in this country.”

At the heart of the story is Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm founded by former Wall Street Journal employees. Little is known about the firm’s list of clients, and Republicans in Congress have pressed the firm and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, to hand over documents about the funding and research that produced the dossier.

The Free Beacon’s editor, Matthew Continetti, and its chairman, Michael Goldfarb, said in a statement that the website was not involved in the dossier.

“All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to The Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that The Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier,” they said. “The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.”

The Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Fusion GPS to research any possible connections between Mr. Trump, his businesses, his campaign team and Russia, court filings revealed this week. Working for them, the firm retained Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence officer.

He went on to produce a series of memos that alleged a broad conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump. The memos, which became known as the “Steele dossier,” also contained unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, as well as real estate deals that were intended as bribes.

Speculation had circulated for months that Mr. Singer was involved in the dossier, but his allies had denied that. On Friday, an associate said Mr. Singer had not been aware of the dossier or Mr. Steele’s involvement in Fusion GPS’s research until January, when BuzzFeed published the dossier.

Mr. Singer was among the leading Republican critics of Mr. Trump during the Republican presidential primary race. Even after Mr. Singer’s first choice, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, dropped out of the race, Mr. Singer continued to fund efforts to block Mr. Trump from the party’s nomination.

The revelation of The Free Beacon’s involvement with Fusion GPS threatens a rapprochement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Singer, who donated $1 million to the president’s inaugural fund and has visited the White House on multiple occasions. After one such visit, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Singer “was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ‘Never Trump,’ and Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support and it’s all about unification.”

Josh Levy, a lawyer representing Fusion GPS, said questions about who funded Mr. Steele’s work should be secondary to its credibility.

The Free Beacon has a history of employing so-called opposition research firms to assist in news articles critical of targets like Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. In their statement, Mr. Continetti and Mr. Goldfarb said that “we stand by our reporting, and we do not apologize for our methods.”



Investigators working with several congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have delved into Mr. Steele’s work as part of inquiries into connections between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including whether they conspired to influence last year’s election.

The Free Beacon’s notification to the House Intelligence Committee came a few days before a deadline set by a federal judge for Fusion GPS’s bank to respond to a subpoena issued by the committee for financial records that could have revealed who funded the dossier.

Fusion GPS had filed a motion to block the subpoena on the grounds that it would “irreparably damage” the company’s business and also “chill” its free speech rights and those of “many others engaging in opposition research on political candidates.”

In a telephone conference with representatives for Fusion GPS, the committee and the bank, the judge hearing the case said that Fusion GPS’s clients have “the expectation of confidentiality.” But the judge added that it was “not to say that the congressional committee doesn’t have interests that may trump those expectations of confidentiality.”

The firm’s connection to Democrats was revealed in a letter this week from Matthew J. Gehringer, the managing partner of the law firm Perkins Coie. The letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research “for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest,” and urged the earlier clients to waive their confidentiality “given the interest in this issue.”

Butterfly,” our not-so-bright Gallimard — a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s — falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag. That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes. (Check out the priceless “Forbidden Broadway” parody of the show.)

In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman. He’s a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman. Got that? Never mind. We’ll get back to it later.

This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler). But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?) within less than three hours of stage time, it’s a lot to assimilate.

There is another, even more distracting problem. Once we’ve seen Mr. Ha — who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw — in boy’s clothes early on (that’s when he says he’s a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), it’s impossible to unsee him as that boy. Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.

You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism. Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.

But more important to the play’s intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly,” Gallimard’s favorite opera. Such, it seems, is the West’s vision of the East.

Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimard’s dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East. That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States. Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about France’s involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving “big guns, big industry, big … well, you know your own fantasies.”

But for “M. Butterfly” to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy. In this version, you always maintain the distance — sometimes amused, sometimes appalled — that’s generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.

Don’t blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film). Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking person’s hunk (“Children of Men,” “The Knick”), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.

The show’s broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera. As Mr. Owen’s Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.

If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes. Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.

Mr. Ha’s arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard. Building up the role of Song’s shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake. Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimard’s wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.

Most disappointing for Ms. Taymor’s fans is the production’s lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to “The Lion King” and her more recent “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady. (Paul Steinberg did the sets.)

The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of “Miss Saigon.” And Elliot Goldenthal’s “original music and soundscapes” are usually more intrusive than evocative.

Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant. Anyone doubting that Gallimard’s pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.

But even if the romance at the heart of “M. Butterfly” is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation. In this incarnation, we’re not being seduced, but preached at.

In Halloween-season viewing prospects, there’s good news and less-good news. The good news is that two stellar restorations of stone-cold horror classics were released recently. They are the amazing, amusing “The Old Dark House,” a 1932 horror comedy directed by James Whale, the maestro of “Frankenstein” and “Bride of Frankenstein,” and George A. Romero’s seminal 1968 “Night of the Living Dead,” which had a long road to a beautiful new version.

The less-good news is that these restorations are not yet available for streaming, but are likely to show up in time. The “Living Dead” restoration is distributed by Janus, whose stuff is regularly featured on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck and Kanopy. (In the meantime, if they show up at a theater near you, I implore you to go.)

Filmstruck is actually an excellent site for vintage horror this Halloween. Earlier this month the service featured premieres of six 1940s horror movies produced by Val Lewton for RKO Pictures. Lewton was a novelist-turned-producer of first-class taste, wide-ranging imagination and remarkable resourcefulness. In emphasizing that taste, critics have risked giving his nine RKO horror movies short shrift in terms of their potency in the fright department.

While some Lewton pictures are more conventionally “thrilling” than others — “The Curse of the Cat People” (1944) is an unusual kind of sequel and features a tone more poetic than spooky — most of the movies still carry strong scares. In the original “Cat People” (1942), the European immigrant Irena (Simone Simon), bride of a Norman-Rockwell-type all-American (Kent Smith) fears that her sexual awakening will turn her into a deadly feline creature. The scenes of Irena’s romantic rival Alice (Jane Randolph) seemingly stalked by a panther through Central Park and at an athletic club are still among the tensest ever executed in film.

Similarly, the director Jacques Tourneur, who was behind “Cat People” and “I Walked With a Zombie” (1943) gets an enormous amount of scare-mileage out of the sound of dripping water, a train going over a bridge and, finally, a bolted door and some terrifying sound effects in a stage-setting scene from “The Leopard Man” (1943). “Cat People,” “Zombie,” “Curse” and “Leopard Man” are all part of the Filmstruck package. The other two titles are “The Body Snatcher” (1945) and “Bedlam” (1946), both more horror-conventional in subject matter and star power. “The Body Snatcher” is derived from the Robert Louis Stevenson story and stars both Boris Karloff of “Frankenstein” and Bela Lugosi of “Dracula” fame — it’s one of only six movies the horror heavyweights made together. A spectacularly ghoulish story of grave robbers and medical demonstrations in 19th-century Edinburgh, it builds to a dizzying pitch of delirium. So does “Bedlam,” also starring Karloff, another grim period piece set in an asylum. Because the Lewton productions were low-budget pictures meant to fill out double-features, they’re pretty concise, with not many reaching the 90-minute mark. As such, the lot can serve as terrific Halloween binge-watching.",Streaming Halloween: Canon Classics and New Movies to Scream With,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/movies/streaming-halloween-canon-classics-and-new-movies-to-scream-with.html

Lower Ninth Ward

Travel east through the city’s French Quarter, Faubourg Marigny and Bywater neighborhoods and you’ll reach the Lower Ninth Ward. The Industrial Canal, which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River and allows cargo ships to pass, essentially cuts off the neighborhood from the rest of the city. This forged a unique culture in the area, which was largely swampland and was drained at the turn of the 20th century, with mostly working-class residents settling the land.

The Domino family lived in a narrow shotgun house on Jourdan Avenue that no longer exists, within sight of the eastern levee of the canal. In his book, Mr. Coleman describes how Mr. Domino “walked the dirt path of Jourdan Avenue to St. Claude Street, lighted in those days only by oil lamps in the houses and the stars above.”

Mr. Domino was rather shy as a child and left formal schooling during the fourth grade. He then had a succession of jobs, from an ice deliveryman helper to stable boy at the New Orleans Fair Grounds to coffee factory worker. During this time, Mr. Domino also learned how to play the piano, a pivotal part of his young life that would come to define his long career.

Even while Mr. Domino was achieving dizzying success, touring the country extensively and embarking on his first European tour in 1962, he preferred to keep his roots in New Orleans.

New Orleanians often spotted Mr. Domino driving around the city in his pink Cadillac. For decades, he resided in the Lower Ninth Ward at 1208 Caffin Avenue with his wife, Rosemary, who died in 2008. The property consists of a shotgun-style building and a corner building trimmed in pink. With a sign that reads “Fats Domino Publishing” and the initials F and D on the front of the home, this landmark property is easily identifiable.

In 1965, Hurricane Betsy brought severe flooding to the neighborhood after the levee protection system was breached. In 2005, flooding from Hurricane Katrina levee breaches was even more catastrophic, emptying the Lower Ninth Ward of much of its population, including Mr. Domino. Many buildings from his young adulthood were razed after they were deemed inhabitable. After initially riding out the storm, Mr. Domino had to be rescued by boat and subsequently decided to live with one of his daughters in Harvey, on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish.

After Mr. Domino’s death, the Lower Ninth Ward property quickly became a makeshift memorial, with admirers visiting to pay their respects and leave personal mementos to commemorate his life. The property presents an opportunity to see a slice of the city that has dealt with a great deal of tumult, but also one that always embraced Mr. Domino and paved the way for his first forays into rhythm and blues.

Central Business District

Canal Street, with its swaying palm trees and bustling streetcar lines, serves as a grand gateway to the heart of the city. In Mr. Domino’s heyday, the street also showcased the dichotomy between the bustling economic engine of the city, and at the time, lower-to-middle black class areas like the Lower Ninth Ward.

The lyrics to “Fat Man” highlight the busy corner of Rampart and Canal, where the black and white worlds of the city, respectively, merge:

I was standin’, I was standin’ on the corner Of Rampart and Canal I was watchin’, watchin’ Watchin’ all these Creole gals

Mr. Domino deftly references Creole culture, acknowledging the mixed-race women who descended from free black citizens. The lyric is a continued recognition of the somewhat fragile racial realities of the time, as well as a nod to his own background.

French Quarter

At the intersection of Rampart Street and Dumaine Street, on the northern edge of the French Quarter, a nondescript laundromat is in the former home of the J&M Recording Studio. The studio, opened by the recording engineer Cosimo Matassa, was designated as a Historic Rock and Roll Landmark by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2010, with songs including “Fat Man” and Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight” having been recorded at the location. Mr. Coleman describes the recording session for “Fat Man” as lasting almost six hours, which was not unusual for Mr. Domino, as he generally practiced his songs religiously.

In the Central Business District and straddling the border with the French Quarter is the old State Palace Theater, which operated as a Loew’s Theater during Mr. Domino’s adolescence. The original building, which was constructed in 1926 and features over 3,000 seats, remains intact, but redevelopment plans remain unclear. Mr. Domino went to the State Palace frequently in the 1940s.

“I used to see Gene Autry movies all the time,” Mr. Domino told Mr. Coleman, adding that he also saw “Roy Rogers, the Three Musketeers, and John Wayne.”

The nearby Civic, Joy and Orpheum Theaters, which all rose to prominence from the late 1900s to the ‘40s, underwent extensive renovations and continue to welcome new generations of audiences.

Mr. Domino’s performances in the 1990s and early 2000s at the House of Blues were highly anticipated and well-received, a testament to his enormous staying power.

New Orleans

Mr. Domino was a master at fusing music genres like rhythm and blues, jazz, boogie-woogie, gospel and even country. His love for New Orleans always remained a major theme in his musical universe. Performances at the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, fittingly held at the Fair Grounds where he once worked as a boy, always brought out legions of his fans. In his later years he played to smaller crowds, including a 2007 set at Tipitina’s Uptown, one of his last public performances.

In the song, “Walking to New Orleans,” Mr. Domino describes the sense of belonging and optimism that the city holds. Despite the sad circumstances, the song is upbeat and refreshingly personal:

I’ve got no time for talkin’ I’ve got to keep on walkin’ New Orleans is my home That’s the reason why I’m goin’ Yes, I’m walkin’ to New Orleans I’m walkin’ to New Orleans

At the time of Mr. Domino’s death, he was 89 years old. New Orleans shaped his work ethic and songwriting throughout his life, a testament to his ability to connect people through music.

Will and the Demogorgon

The center of the “Stranger Things” universe is the Byers family: the geeky 12-year-old Will (Noah Schnapp), who disappears on his way home from a Dungeons & Dragons game; his older brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), a teenage outcast who loves punk music; and their fragile but fiercely devoted single mom, Joyce (Winona Ryder).

As we find out, Will was spirited away to a creepy parallel dimension known as the Upside Down, by a monster whose head resembles a Venus fly trap. Will’s friends start calling the creature Demogorgon, after a demon from Dungeons and Dragons.

In the Season 1 finale, Jonathan; his friend Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer); and her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery), booby-trap the Byers house and lure the Demogorgon there in hopes of killing it. The teens put up a valiant fight, but as soon as they manage to set the monster on fire, it escapes. Thankfully, they’ve distracted it just long enough to allow Joyce to sneak into the Upside Down in hopes of saving Will.

In the final scene of the season, Will, Joyce and Jonathan celebrate Christmas together at home. It’s a happy ending — until Will starts to feel sick, coughs up a sluglike creature in the bathroom and is transported, for a moment, back to the Upside Down. You can take the kid out of the nightmare realm, but it seems that you can’t quite take the nightmare realm out of the kid.

The Lab and the Upside Down

Although the show spends plenty of time in the Upside Down, it’s still not entirely clear what this parallel reality actually is. We do know that a portal opened between the two realms when scientists at the Hawkins National Laboratory, a secretive government facility, used a telekinetic girl called simply “11” (Millie Bobby Brown) to make contact with the monster.

The Upside Down looks the way Hawkins might if its buildings and trees were all decaying, the sun never shined and everything were covered in vines made out of mucous. The air is supposedly toxic. (Uproxx has a great list of questions about the Upside Down that “Stranger Things” hasn’t answered yet.)

In the real Hawkins, the lab’s staff is desperate to find Eleven, who was the prisoner of its leader, Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), a research scientist who abducted the girl and raised her to consider him her father. As Brenner hunts for her, Will’s friends and family uncover the connection between the laboratory and the boy’s disappearance. A final showdown between the kids, the Demogorgon and Brenner’s minions leaves many of those minions dead. Going into Season 2, it’s not clear whether the scientist lived through the battle.

Eleven

Eleven isn’t just any psychokinetic tween. The show implies that she’s also the missing daughter of Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins), a local woman who accidentally got pregnant while participating in one of Brenner’s deeply unethical experiments. She is certain that her daughter, Jane, who was born with telekinesis and ESP, was abducted as a baby. But the lab’s cover-up has led her relatives to believe that Terry, who’s been catatonic for years, miscarried in her third trimester and became delusional after suffering that loss.

Because she’s spent her entire life in the lab undergoing Brenner’s experiments, Eleven is silent, scared and largely ignorant about the outside world by the time she meets Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). It’s with those three boys that she learns about the small pleasures of middle-school life, from frozen waffles to role-playing games.

Eleven’s story appears to end in the season finale’s climactic middle-school showdown, when she uses her powers to vanquish the Demogorgon and save her new buddies. Both she and the monster disappear. It’s a heartbreaking sacrifice, but it’s pretty clear she’ll be back for Season 2.

The Boys

While searching for Will, his friends meet an escaped Eleven and hide her in Mike’s basement. In hopes of making contact with Will, Dustin builds a sensory deprivation tank in the middle-school gym in order to recreate the setting where Eleven first glimpsed the Upside Down. And Lucas, who’s initially more suspicious of Eleven than the other boys are, goes on a solo spy mission at the laboratory. His reconnaissance helps her evade the feds — for a while.

Love, Hawkins Style

Just before Eleven battles the Demogorgon, Mike musters the courage to ask her to the school’s Snow Ball, and they kiss. His infatuation with her was palpable for most of the season, so their separation soon after is painful to see.

Theirs isn’t the only relationship thrown into chaos by the Upside Down. After Nancy’s best friend, Barb Holland (Shannon Purser), vanishes in much the same way Will did, Nancy and Jonathan investigate the disappearances together. Steve believes they’re hooking up behind his back and paints graffiti all over Hawkins, calling her a slut. But Steve redeems himself when he tells off his nasty friends and joins Nancy and Jonathan in battling the Demogorgon. Sadly for Jonathan, who’s obviously in love with her, Nancy and Steve are back together by the end of the season.

David Harbour in “Stranger Things.” Curtis Baker/Netflix

Chief Jim Hopper

And then there’s the most obvious love interest for Joyce: the local police chief, Jim Hopper (David Harbour). Initially a cynical, private and somewhat debauched presence in Hawkins, he becomes her greatest adult ally in the search for Will, and the two of them wind up trudging through the Upside Down together to find him. Still, years after his young daughter’s death and the divorce it catalyzed, Hopper remains a haunted man. As he struggles to resuscitate Joyce’s son, he flashes back to his little girl’s final days in the hospital, as doctors tried and failed to do the same. With Will, however, the efforts to revive him are successful, and Hopper and Joyce soon carry the boy to safety.

For all his heroism, we’re stuck with the uncomfortable fact that he gave up Eleven’s location to Brenner — and that his relationship with the feds may not have ended there. In a subsequent, unexplained scene, Hopper reluctantly gets into a car with people who appear to be government agents. Along with Will’s momentary descent into the Upside Down and Eleven’s whereabouts, this meeting is one of the finale’s most captivating cliffhangers.

What About Barb?

There’s one final loose end, and it’s #JusticeForBarb. Barb was last seen in the Upside Down, looking very still and white and lifeless, with a slug crawling out of her mouth. The show’s creators, Ross and Matt Duffer, have confirmed her death. But in an interview, Matt promised that while the internet’s favorite character won’t return, her story isn’t entirely over. “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb,” he said.

PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

In these six elegant stories she’s most interested in the ambiguities and periodic disturbances that plague the imagination, and reports on them with the appropriate sense of awe, even of dread. In the territory of the imagination, the threat of madness is never too far away, a dark cloud hovering.

The clouds that roll through the four novellas in Joe Hill’s STRANGE WEATHER (Morrow, $27.99) are pretty consistently ominous, too, though they mean something different in every story. In “Snapshot,” the fearsome thunderstorm unleashed at the climax seems to stand for the washing away of memories from an Alzheimer’s-afflicted mind. In “Loaded,” the cloud is a thick haze of smoke from a raging forest fire approaching a Florida town — where a psychopathic mall security cop on a killing spree is generating some deadly smoke of his own. “Aloft” (the book’s weakest story) finds its hero, a terrified first-time skydiver, marooned atop a fluffy-looking but curiously solid white cloud. And in the apocalyptic “Rain,” the clouds burst with lethal precipitation, dagger-like crystals that riddle anyone unlucky enough to get caught in the downpour. Hill’s fiction is squarely in the pulp-horror tradition that Matheson helped establish — yarns about extraordinary things happening to ordinary folks — and, unsurprisingly, because he is Stephen King’s son, it’s King’s relentless, hard-charging Matheson that his work most closely resembles. His afterburners have afterburners. All his writing has a headlong, almost manic momentum, which can be a tad wearying in his long novels, but is nicely suited to the hundred-or-so-page narratives in “Strange Weather.” It’s particularly effective in “Loaded,” with its escalating, incomprehensible (and non-supernatural) mayhem.

And when Hill eases up on the gas pedal a little, as he does from time to time in “Snapshot,” he’s even better. That story, about an old woman’s loss of her self and a fat boy’s development of his, lingers now and then over photographs, which are here synonymous with the memories without which a self is functionally impossible. Hill seems to feel that he can relax some in this one, go a bit deeper, because he trusts his metaphor. Just as Matheson always did.

It’s no accident that King’s “pure drive” version of the Matheson legacy is the dominant one in modern horror. I sometimes think that all horror writers are cases of arrested development, stuck forever in the terrors and insecurities of adolescence. (Or is it just the guys?) Most of today’s best practitioners of the genre were teenagers in the 1980s, when Stephen King paperbacks, dark covers beckoning, ruled the mall bookstores, the drugstore racks, the train waiting rooms and the airport departure lounges, waiting for sensation-seeking kids to become their loyal lifelong subjects. Many of Joe Hill’s generation (he was born in 1972) signed up eagerly, and a few turned into writers like Victor LaValle, Paul Tremblay, Gemma Files, John Langan, Laird Barron, Sarah Langan and Stephen Graham Jones.

Benjamin Percy, born in 1979, might have been too young for that party, but on the evidence of his thrilling new novel, THE DARK NET (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26), it seems likely that an older relative somehow sneaked him in. “The Dark Net” is, at least on its crowded surface, one of the best Stephen King novels not written by the master himself. The fate of the world, or at least Portland, Ore., depends on the ability of a motley gang of misfits to head off the eruption of satanic forces from the murkiest recesses of the internet. The devil’s chief opponents are a frazzled newspaper reporter, a former child evangelist now living under an alias, an ageless drug dealer, a homeless man and a 12-year-old girl (the reporter’s niece), blind since the age of 5, who is learning to see again with the aid of a virtual-reality-like headset.

The setup promises furious action, and Percy delivers, like Matheson, like King. But plot isn’t everything in “The Dark Net.” Percy, in a mere 253 pages, finds space, too, for evocative descriptions of urban landscapes, patient development of his characters’ psyches, and thoughtful ruminations on the attractions and the perils of cyberspace. And, because this is a horror novel, he permits himself the occasional light musing on the nature of good and evil. It’s an awfully impressive literary performance.

Photo

Obviously, there’s more than a trace of LaValle’s survival-centric, morally curious Matheson in this book, too, but that sort of horror is, in its pure form, much less common. I found it, though, in a few stories in Nadia Bulkin’s striking debut collection, SHE SAID DESTROY (Word Horde, paper, $16.99). Some of her pieces, like “Intertropical Convergence Zone” and “The Five Stages of Grief,” examine political oppression and the terrible choices it imposes. (Bulkin, who grew up in Indonesia during the declining years of the Suharto dictatorship, also holds a degree in political science.) And those are distinctly horror tales of the “What threatens your existence and what will you do to get through?” variety, with a coldly angry 21st-century edge; a couple of the lesser stories are all edge. My favorite piece in “She Said Destroy” is perhaps its quietest, a stunningly original ghost story called “Endless Life,” whose heroine, a hotel maid, haunts the room she died in by accident — which happens to be the same place where a brutal general, known popularly as the Jackal, died by his own hand. The maid’s singular misfortune is that people believe that the resident spirit is that of the Jackal, and check in to enjoy a morbid kick or to mourn their own dead or to hurl abuse at the general’s departed soul, which is farther away than they think. The story, a melancholy wisp, is in the maid’s posthumous reactions to the emotions of the people who pass through the infamous Room 305; through their kinks and grief and rage, Bulkin sketches a deft portrait of a wounded society. And in the dead maid’s shifting responses, the story manages to suggest that in some political environments the tough choices persist beyond the grave.

Every possible Matheson — King’s, LaValle’s and mine, anyway — seems to inhabit the modest quarters of Stephen Graham Jones’s brilliant novella MAPPING THE INTERIOR (Tor, paper, $10.99), whose narrator, a sleepwalking 12-year-old American Indian boy, sees his father’s ghost one night in the tiny modular home (just off the reservation) that he shares with his mother and his little brother. Because he’s a kid, on the cusp of 13, Junior doesn’t have much trouble believing in the ghost. Besides, this is the ghost he wants. “My heart pounded in my chest with what I wanted to call fear,” he says, “but what I now know was actually hope.” As Jones — himself American Indian — knows, hope is a rare commodity in Junior’s community, and the boy embraces it enthusiastically. But as all grown-ups know, hope is also a cruelly mixed blessing; best to be wary. By the end of “Mapping the Interior” Junior, an optimistic but not a stupid boy, has gone through something like the adult process of epistemological suspense: kicking the tires of that notion you’re thinking of believing, then taking it for a spin before you seal the deal.

That’s my Matheson, right there. Jones burdens his young hero with plenty of life-or-death decisions, as LaValle would have it. And he drives the action with a heavy foot on the accelerator, in accordance with King’s decree. How can there be three Richard Mathesons in one slim book? Maybe it’s just my imagination. Or maybe it’s The Twilight Zone.","A Roundup of New Horror, All Indebted to an Early Master",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/books/review/best-of-richard-matheson-new-horror-fiction.html

I taught my first class at Columbia University’s M.F.A. program this month, and even though I’ve been teaching college writing since 1993, I initially felt a little intimidated by the school’s regal campus. That, and regretful.

I enjoyed going to college at the University of Michigan, an hour from home, but my secret humiliation is: I was the type of mediocre student I now disdain. As a freshman, I cared about my friends, my boyfriend and my poetry. Or, I cared about what my boyfriend thought of my friends, what my friends thought of him, and what they thought of my poetry about him. Here’s what I wish I’d known and done differently:

A’S ARE COOL AND COME WITH PERKS As a student, I saw myself as anti-establishment, and I hated tests; I barely maintained a B average. I thought only nerds spent weekends in the library studying. Recently I learned that my niece Dara, a sophomore at New York University with a 3.7 G.P.A. (and a boyfriend), was offered a week of travel in Buenos Aires as part of her honors seminar. I was retroactively envious to learn that a 3.5 G.P.A. or higher at many schools qualifies you for free trips, scholarships, grants, awards, private parties and top internships. At 20, I was too busy freaking out when said boyfriend disappeared (after sleeping with one of said friends). Students certainly don’t need to strive obsessively for perfection, but I should have prioritized grades, not guys.

SHOW UP AND SPEAK UP If a class was boring or it snowed, I’d skip. My rationale was that nobody in the 300-person lecture hall would notice and I could get notes later. Attendance barely counted. When I went, I’d sit quietly in back. Yet as a teacher, I see that the students who come weekly, sit in front, and ask and answer questions get higher grades and frankly, preferential treatment. After 15 weeks, I barely know the absentees or anyone Snapchatting the term away on their iPhones. It’s not just that these students flush $300 down the toilet every time they miss my class; participating can actually lead to payoffs. I reward those who try harder with recommendations, references, professional contacts and encouragement.

CLASS CONNECTIONS CAN LAUNCH YOUR CAREER As an undergrad, I rarely visited my professors during office hours. I didn’t want to annoy teachers with what I considered triviality. Besides, I thought I knew everything already. In graduate school, on the other hand, I went to the readings of a professor I admired. Eventually, I’d go to his office just to vent. Once, after I complained about a dead-end job, he recommended me for a position at The New Yorker, jump-starting my career.

Yet some of the Democrats who funded the dossier have been leery about being associated with it. The lead Perkins Coie lawyer representing both the campaign and the D.N.C., Marc Elias, pushed back earlier this year when asked whether his firm was the client for the dossier, whether he possessed it before the election and whether he was involved in efforts to encourage media outlets to write about its contents.

On Tuesday, the veteran Democratic consultant Anita Dunn, who is working with Perkins Coie, explained Mr. Elias’s earlier response. “Obviously, he was not at liberty to confirm Perkins Coie as the client at that point, and should perhaps have ‘no commented’ more artfully,” Ms. Dunn wrote in an email.

Is this sort of research common or legal?

Campaigns and party committees frequently pay companies to assemble what’s known in politics as opposition research — essentially damaging information about their opponents — and nothing is illegal about the practice.

However, Republicans and campaign watchdogs have accused the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. of violating campaign finance laws by disguising the payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission. Their disclosure reports do not list any payments from the Clinton campaign or the D.N.C. to Fusion GPS. They do list a total of $12.4 million in payments to Perkins Coie, but that’s almost entirely for legal consulting, with only one payment — of $66,500 — for “research consulting” from the D.N.C.

In a complaint filed with the F.E.C. on Wednesday, the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group that urges stricter enforcement of election laws, alleged that “at least some of those payments were earmarked for Fusion GPS, with the purpose of conducting opposition research on Donald Trump.” The complaint asserts that the failure to list the ultimate purpose of that money “undermined the vital public information role that reporting is intended to serve.”

Graham M. Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, called the complaint “patently baseless,” in part because, he said, the research was done “to support the provision of legal services, and payments made by vendors to sub-vendors are not required to be disclosed in circumstances like this.”

Who else knew about Mr. Steele’s research during the campaign?

Officials from the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. have said they were unaware that Perkins Coie facilitated the research on their behalf, even though the law firm was using their money to pay for it. Even Mrs. Clinton only found about Mr. Steele’s research after Buzzfeed published the dossier, according to two associates who discussed the matter with her. They said that she was disappointed that the research — as well as the fact that the F.B.I. was looking into connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia — was not made public before Election Day.

But word of the memos and their contents had circulated in Washington political and media circles before the election. In British court filings, Mr. Steele’s lawyers said that he and Fusion GPS briefed journalists from a range of media outlets, including The New York Times, on his research starting in September of 2016.

Yet the research and even the existence of the dossier were not reported by the media, with the exception of Mother Jones magazine, which published a story in the days before the election that described the dossier, its origin and significance, while omitting the salacious claims.

How much of the dossier has been substantiated?

There has been no public corroboration of the salacious allegations against Mr. Trump, nor of the specific claims about coordination between his associates and the Russians. In fact, some of those claims have been challenged with supporting evidence. For instance, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, produced his passport to rebut the dossier’s claim that he had secret meetings in Prague with a Russian official last year.

Where does the dossier fit in with the government’s Russia investigations?

James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whose firing by Mr. Trump prompted the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department’s Russia investigation, received a copy of the memos after Election Day from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. McCain had dispatched David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official, to obtain the dossier directly from Mr. Steele. And before Election Day, the F.B.I. reached an agreement to pay Mr. Steele to continue his research, though that plan was scrapped after the dossier was published. During the presidential transition, senior American intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama on the dossier.

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Jason Greene, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs.","There is plenty of like-minded confabbing — Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress — that makes everybody look right and good. And in “Chicago Stories,” with Mr. Emanuel, this combative mayor recasts himself as a kinder, gentler interlocutor of anodyne local figures, like brewery owners and spoken-word poets. It’s working. The Chicago Tribune has praised the podcast for showing “what can happen when a control-the-narrative mayor loosens the reins just a little.” You know, on the podcast he controls completely.

Excepting Mr. Duffy, this is largely a Democratic phenomenon, and not because people who listen to podcasts are more liberal. Podcast listeners are only a little more left-leaning than America at large: According to Edison Research, 27 percent of Americans identify as Republicans, compared with 24 percent of adult podcast listeners. And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.

But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities. (“Off the Sidelines” from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and “Off the Cuff” from Representative Jared Huffman of California popped up last year; “We the Podcast” from Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, begun in 2015, was ahead of its time.)

All of these Democrats have taken a page from Mr. Trump himself. The president doesn’t have his own podcast (yet), but no other lawmaker has so successfully leveraged the internet to push out his own version of the news, whether through his Twitter account or through his weekly self-branded Facebook video news report, the “Real News Update” hosted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.

Traditional news media might be politically polarized — watch Fox News or MSNBC for different versions of the day’s events — but the internet has allowed for platforms focused on even more granular political preferences. Now, you don’t have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through “The Bernie Sanders Show,” in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.

The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven. But that’s not the only thing wrong with it. The podcasts are also boring.

Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them. Mr. Emanuel’s podcast would probably be more captivating if he weren’t so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill. And I’m sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what it’s like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but he’s instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.

None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless you’re a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict. Mr. Duffy has expressed interest in having the liberal California Representative Maxine Waters on as a guest in the future, telling the conservative website The Daily Caller: “Maxine and I don’t agree on much of anything,” but “I think Maxine is a nice person, I think Maxine is a good person.” Hopefully, they’ll get into those disagreements instead of just talking about how nice the other person is.

Part of the problem is that for lawmakers, podcasting is obviously a side gig. In the first episode of “Canarycast,” Mr. Brown tells his guests — a trio of Whirlpool workers — that he has to end the interview to cast a vote. Ms. Gillibrand’s podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes. I guess she’s been busy.

The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office. These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain. They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign podcast, “With Her,” became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue. Freed from being vice president, Joe Biden is now lending his brand to an experimental audio news curation project, “Biden’s Briefing,” which is billed as a “skillcast” for devices like Alexa and Google Home but is also available to download as a regular podcast.

The highlight of the category is “Stay Tuned With Preet,” starring Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney fired by President Trump. Some speculated that Mr. Bharara might seek elected office, but instead he’s teamed up with his brother, an internet entrepreneur, and created a podcast that takes the contours of a thrilling and urgent civics lesson.

If politicians really want to excel at podcasting, maybe they should quit their day jobs. For lawmakers, the podcast is rarely undertaken in the legitimate pursuit of good content but is instead a dull, modern version of constituent outreach. These shows are an attempt to signal that they are listening to us. But that doesn’t mean that we should listen to them.",Politicians Are Bad at Podcasting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/politicians-are-bad-at-podcasting.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

While Microsoft’s attempts at selling some kinds of devices have been a disappointment — its foray into making smartphones was a bomb — its Surface line of computers showed positive results, rising 12 percent to $1.04 billion in revenue.",What Worries?

For all of the tres-’80s trappings, Reese’s Pieces and paranormal pyrotechnics, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer have kept “Stranger Things” grounded in the story of a bunch of relatively normal people who went through an extraordinary and cataclysmic experience.

“Stranger Things” was a kick thanks to its (exhaustively documented) references and Goonie thrills. But it resonated because its tale of monsters and plucky outsiders channeled the heart as well as the aesthetics of its influences.

Market demands aside, it wasn’t clear that the show even needed a second season, and the Duffers’ silly insistence that it be called “Stranger Things 2” — like a real movie sequel! — suggested the sort of showrunner overreach that scuttled the sophomore seasons of other recent summer sensations, like “True Detective” and “UnREAL.”

So it comes as a nice surprise that the second season instead evinces the best of serial television, expanding the story and moving it forward while honoring the characters and the often traumatic paths that brought them here.

On the expansion side we have the aforementioned Billy (Dacre Montgomery), who brought his bitchin’ Camaro, snug Canadian tuxedo and stink of adolescent danger to town from California. His sister (maybe?) Max (Sadie Sink) is a Dig Dug savant, and the obsession of Lucas and the newly toothed Dustin. (Gaten Matarazzo continues to steal every scene he’s in.) The always great Brett Gelman (“Twin Peaks: The Return,” “Eagleheart”) is on hand as an investigator who’s possibly fleecing Barb’s folks, but who also has legitimate-sounding intel about Eleven.

The season actually began with a broadening of the story, tracking a robber gang fleeing the police through the streets of Pittsburgh. After one of them mentally tricks a cop into crashing his and the other cars in pursuit, a “008” tattoo on her wrist reminds us that, oh right, there are potentially at least 10 other Elevens running around to spark telekinetic mayhem and future subplots.

We’ll return to Eight at some point, presumably, but after the brief introduction we landed back in Hawkins, Ind., a few days before Halloween, 1984, not quite a year after the events of Season 1. The boys are budding video junkies, dumping too many quarters into the then-revolutionary but actually pretty lame animated game Dragon’s Lair.

Paul Reiser, riffing on his duplicitous “Aliens” character, has replaced Matthew Modine as the master of Upside Down ceremonies. He explains that although Will thinks, 1.) he’s dimension-hopping; and 2.) that a malevolent force is saying it wants to kill everyone, what he’s really experiencing is post-traumatic stress.

“I need you to realize I’m on your side,” he tells a skeptical Joyce. (Note: He is probably not on her side.)

With its tendril-like limbs and leafy face flaps, the Demogorgon had a botanical quality: Last year, I called it a monster mash-up of Alien, Predator and a Venus flytrap, and I stand by the description. This time around the menace seems even more explicitly vegetal. Work in the lab involves a lot of pruning via flamethrower while, on the outskirts of town, the pumpkin patches have begun to resemble Civil War battlefields. You don’t have to be Sheriff Hopper to see a connection.

What you do have to be him to see, at least for now, is Eleven. You’ll recall that at the end of last season, he was leaving out Eggos for her — apparently at some point he made contact and was able to take her in.

The arrangement offers a poignant second chance for Hopper, who lost his own daughter to illness, even as Mike and perhaps Eleven suffer from the separation. We’ll see how long it lasts. “Stranger Things 2” (sigh) deserves credit for not immediately defaulting to “Eleven and the Nerds Ride Again,” but you can bet it will get there before long.

A Few Thoughts While We Crank It Up

• The premiere did a decent job of mixing in less played-out ’80s hits, like Oingo Boingo’s “Just Another Day,” with the more obvious ones (“Whip It,” “Talking in Your Sleep”). But sometimes the most obvious option is the best one: “Rock You Like a Hurricane” is the only choice for a denim-clad cheese ball like Billy.

• Nancy switched up her hairstyle, but the thing she really needs to change is sitting next to her, bungling his college admissions essay. That would be Steve, who’s already envisioning working for his dad and settling down. Run, Nancy! It’s too late for Barb — save yourself!

235,"['dr', 'surgery', 'question', 'seib', 'frailty', 'older', 'operation', 'surgical', 'patients', 'patient', 'frail']","A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.
They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.
“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.
“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said.
So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty?","Along with other frailty measures, that meant that “surgery is not going to go very well,” Dr. Robinson said. In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery. If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now.

Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages. Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65.

But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85. “There’s a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans,” said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof. The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia.

Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age. A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.

In the United States, though, “it’s the surgeons who have picked up the banner,” Dr. Walston said. They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.

You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress.

Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed — all can take a toll.

“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.

Researchers have shown that after major operations — including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants — frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after they’re discharged.

They’re also more likely to die.

But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine.

Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer — “patients and providers often don’t think twice about these,” Dr. Seib said.

Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications).

“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said. Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, “I wouldn’t say it’s routine yet,” she added.

So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty? Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be?

Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about. “There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it,” said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research.

First, many surgical centers offer a “prehabilitation” program, shown to improve patients’ results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation. Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, “it improves your bounce-back capability,” Dr. Fried said.

Physical activity, in particular, “seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression,” Dr. Fried added — even for those not contemplating surgery.

Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing. Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia. A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh.

With frailty, “I’m going to counsel the patient differently,” Dr. Robinson said. “Maybe change the surgery I do. Maybe find an alternative. There’s a spectrum of possibilities.”

Take his patient with gallstone disease.

After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure.

Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient. But “for a physiologically vulnerable older adult,” Dr. Robinson said, “it’s a whole different equation.”",One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/elderly-surgery-frailty.html

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

6 Spooky Travel Destinations for the Halloween Season

With all the attention Thanksgiving and Christmas get from travelers, it’s easy to overlook Halloween as a destination holiday. While a few cities provide a spooky vibe year-round, annual festivals, theme park pop-up events and other haunted happenings elsewhere have helped make the holiday a travel mini-season all its own.

New Orleans

Home to voodoo legends and year-round cemetery walks, New Orleans is among the cities that naturally harmonize with Halloween. Worth noting every October is the Krewe of Boo, happening this year on Oct. 21. The family-friendly, Mardi-Gras-inspired Halloween parade has floats devoted to themes like werewolves and vampires. Float riders throw trinkets to the crowd, including locally made candy. New Orleans hosts plenty of after-event parties, but the procession itself draws all ages in costume.

Transylvania

The region most associated with Dracula — one of Gothic horror’s most famous villains — Transylvania is well worth discovering in its own right. This swath of central and western Romania is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved and its ethnic and political history rich and complex.

But yes, there’s also that medieval clock tower in the well-preserved center of the town of Sighisoara — with a torture chamber beneath — across the street from the house where Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler of Walachia (a region that later became part of Romania) is said to have been born in 1431. He is believed by many to have inspired the fictional character of Dracula, though some dispute that. There’s also Bran Castle, which is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula.

Whitby, England

This picturesque town on England’s Yorkshire coast can also stake claim to being the home of Dracula, though in a different way. Bram Stoker spent just a month in Whitby, but those four weeks in July and August 1890 were pivotal in the creation of his most famous book, “Dracula,” which was published in 1897. Whitby celebrated the 125th anniversary of Stoker’s visit in 2015, but this year you can see the skeletal remains of Whitby Abbey illuminated throughout the final week of October.

Salem, Mass.

Home to the infamous witch trials of the early 1690s, it should come as no surprise that this town is a hotbed for Halloween activity. One way Salem builds on its spectral past is with the monthlong Festival of the Dead . Events include psychic readings, séances, a Halloween ball, a mourning-themed tea and, on Halloween night, a witches gathering. For more, look to the city’s official website dedicated to numerous other Halloween-themed events.

There’s also plenty to do that isn’t witch-themed, like a visit to the Peabody-Essex Museum , founded in 1799 as the East India Marine Society, a “cabinet of natural and artificial curiosities” where local captains involved in the China trade donated items from their wide-ranging travels. You can also tour the House of the Seven Gables, made famous by Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1951 novel.

Derry, Northern Ireland

Halloween is believed by many to have its roots in the ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, which was celebrated by Derry’s ancestors. Selected as the top Halloween destination in the world in a USA Today readers’ poll last year, Derry (or Londonderry, as it is also known) seems to do everything it can each year to earn such a reputation. About 80,000 people attended the 30th annual Derry Halloween festival last year.

Derry has done much to overcome its tumultuous past as the birthplace of the Troubles , the three-decade-long struggle between Irish nationalists and Protestant “loyalists,” who sought to keep Northern Ireland part of the United Kingdom. The centerpiece of the town is the soaring Peace Bridge that opened over the River Foyle in 2011.

Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abcess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned her, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, who Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly enraged child advocates. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

The United States is in the throes of a great debate: Do we want — can we afford — to remain a safe haven for people who, unlike economic migrants, come here running for their lives? This year the administration slashed the number of refugees the United States will allow by more than half.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s whom we are turning our backs on first.

Ms. Gonzalez is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by the police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state fees. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she said, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who wakes up screaming with nightmares and crawls into bed with her — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Ms. Gonzalez is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Ms. Gonzalez and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress get rid of a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers — they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent, a remedy that has been the most successful path for these children to get legal status.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian be allowed to spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes in the United States as the authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a Border Patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that Border Patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have identified hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that Border Patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration curtailed a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. When that policy change was made, some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the addresses and names of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

Amid all this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, said Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally.

But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are appearing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

Dreamers, despite having the most to lose, have been most adamant in rejecting Trump’s proposals. “It’s a white-nationalist racist wish list,” said Cristina Jiménez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.","To Help a Dreamer, Why Do We Have to Hurt Her Cousin?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/dreamers-children-immigration-congress.html

3. As someone living in Arizona, I would suggest that the rest of the nation needs to realize how worrisome, even frightening, Senator Jeff Flake’s decision is. Flake, with Christian (specifically, Mormon) ideals, is giving up his fight for conservative ideals because the behavior he’s seeing on ‘his side’ is contrary to his Christian principles, to common decency.

Horrifying that the atmosphere in our nation has gotten so bad that even a conservative politician whose party is in power is leaving for this reason. I never liked Flake’s politics, much as I didn’t like John McCain’s politics much of the time, but both men are being entirely sincere in their recent statements and perspectives.

Trove of J.F.K. Assassination Documents Released

8. I was six and at school when J.F.K. was assassinated. I spent the bulk of my life believing that there probably was a conspiracy. Matters like Lee Harvey Oswald being assassinated in public view by a man with loose mob ties certainly raised suspicions. Over the years many misconceptions have been cleared up, many of those misconceptions put forth by Oliver Stone.

Modern, data-driven testing and continued research of many aspects of the event have pointed to one reasonable conclusion: Oswald acted alone. Probably the only cover-ups were to protect the Secret Service, which absolutely blew it. No plot — just sloppy incompetence, sloppy enough that a deranged man could just sit in the window where he worked and assassinate a president.

The difference between being in ninth grade, or a senior in college, or even a catering grunt on the cusp of 30, and now, when I am an actual, indisputable grown-up, is that I can put together a real straight-up, sit-down dinner party in two hours rather than two months. I still cut branches and collect interesting grasses on a morning walk. And my decades of spending school and rent money on yard-sale cotton cocktail napkins, silver nut picks, pearl-tipped hors d’oeuvres forks and ivory-handled cake servers means I can set a beautiful and interesting table in 10 minutes.

And I am now dead sure that the food of a dinner party wants to be made entirely in the home by that home’s cook, with all of that home’s idiosyncrasies writ large. If there is even a whiff of professional chef on the plate, your dinner party is off to a lousy start and won’t recuperate. Someone will invariably be compelled to take a photograph on her smartphone even before the salad course has been cleared, and then, as far as I’m concerned, we will have gathered for some fetishistic, unsavory purpose not meant for the home.

Table Talk Small talk need not be soporific. Before the dinner party, try to find some recent news items or weird science stories that people most likely haven’t heard about. Did you know that music is beneficial to cats undergoing surgery? Or that there is a library in Norway that is amassing 100 never-before-read books that no one can check out for 100 years?

The Martinez cocktail on this night is batched, not because I want to be slick but because I have a whisper-thin, gorgeous glass pitcher that I found for $11 at a Value Village when I was a grad student and that I am thrilled to have the opportunity to use. And while it may come off as an out-of-reach cheffy move to call for feuille de brick for the borek — and to offer no easy-to-source substitute — that is wholly a reflection of the Type A, rather rigid facet of my personality, not of my profession. I am just not ever going to be the kind of girl who says, “Go ahead, if you can’t find pigeon, make the pigeon pie with boneless chicken breasts.” Go find the brick; it’s an uncommon delight, shatteringly crisp and unusual, and most important, it’s the correct ingredient for the recipe.

But just because the cocktail is ready to pour over ice upon guests’ arrival, and the fried borek with halloumi and parsley and grape leaves is even better if fried a few minutes in advance of the party’s start, I’m still, always and forever, going to be about 10 minutes late. I’ve come to believe this is a necessary part of the successful dinner party — these decades later my good friends know this, too. They know to shepherd the uninitiated guests. Pile the newbies’ coats in the bedroom, take their flowers and get them right into water while I am still toweling off and combing my hair. And then we will roll out from there, take our seats around the table, open the wines and pour. The braised leeks and the lentils and the roasted rabbits will be resting on the sideboard. People will pass their plates to be served. At some point, you will tell your one good joke, which you got from your father. And the dessert — walnuts and tangerines and bars of bitter chocolate — will be set out when the candles have shrunk. By now, almost everyone at the table will know that there are more candles in the drawer, and that there is more brandy to be poured, and that we will be sitting around that table for many more hours, twisting the foils in our fingers as we linger.

Nevertheless, H.I.V. remains a leading cause of death for those 25 to 44, particularly among black men.

Show me how I did. … has increased by more than 650 percent. In 2015, more Americans died from drug overdoses than from car accidents and gun homicides combined.

It’s the worst drug overdose epidemic in American history, spurred by rising drug abuse, increased availability of prescription opioids and an influx of potent synthetics like fentanyl and carfentanil. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.

“It’s horrifying,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a heroin researcher and a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s not even the magnitude — it’s the steepness at which it’s climbing.” Preliminary numbers for 2017 suggest that overdose deaths are growing at a rate comparable to the height of the H.I.V. epidemic.

The number who die each year from...

The opioid epidemic has not fallen equally on all races or regions. Like an infectious disease, drug overdoses have emerged in clusters around the country.

Among those 15 to 44 — the age group in which drug overdose accounts for the greatest share of deaths — there are vast differences across racial categories and between urban and rural places. Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.

Percentage of deaths in 15-to-44-year-olds caused by drug overdoses Note: In counties with fewer than 10 drug overdose deaths, the map combines observed totals with modeled estimates

The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.

“It just blew through all the measures we’d been taking,” said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn’t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there’s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug’s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.

The illicit fentanyls being added to the heroin supply also vary widely in purity and quality. This unpredictability kills: Users often don’t realize the strength of what they’re taking until it’s too late.

An evolving epidemic

The country's struggles with opioids go back centuries, but the current epidemic has roots in the 1980s, when a few studies made doctors less wary of prescribing opioids for pain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers began aggressively marketing them for many ailments, particularly after OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid, hit the market in 1996. Soon, narcotics that had been reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care found their way into medicine cabinets across the country.

Michael Botticelli, the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and former White House drug czar, said that rampant over-prescription of painkillers had actually been decreasing in the last few years. “We’d turned a corner on that,” Mr. Botticelli said, “but we’ve seen the continued escalation of overdose deaths in many states.”

Some experts argue that the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, undertaken when addiction treatment was insufficient, pushed people toward heroin and inadvertently drove up the rate of overdose deaths. Mr. Botticelli said that theory isn’t supported by the data.

Regardless of the cause, there is little disagreement that heroin addiction has evolved into a full-fledged crisis of its own. “Young people are flocking to heroin,” Dr. Ciccarone said. Halting prescription opioid abuse will probably not be enough to stop the growing number of deaths.

What can be done

The Trump administration has established a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study responses to the epidemic. The commission’s final report is expected in November.

Among public health researchers, there is broad agreement about what's needed: access to addiction treatment and medications; tighter regulation of prescription opioids; widespread distribution of naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote; needle exchanges or supervised injection centers; and law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, the bulk of which is thought to come from China and Mexico.

“This is not a hopeless situation,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., describing interdiction as a critical piece of the strategy. “If law enforcement can substantially interfere with the supply of illicit opioids, it will save a lot of lives.”

He and other experts expressed hope for new partnerships between law enforcement and public health. Cooperation would, for example, allow public health workers to pinpoint groups of drug users who may be amenable to treatment or identify particularly deadly batches of drugs before they kill.",You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html

Much of the income inequality in the county, which is still acutely felt, is due to the aftereffects of the systematic racism of apartheid, which ended in 1994. Decades of work to abolish that system culminated in the swearing-in of Nelson Mandela as the nation’s first black head of state.

If you’re looking to experience the essentials of that history, a visit to Soweto is a must. Just a 25-minute drive from downtown, Soweto (which stands for South Western Township) was a major center of apartheid resistance in the ’70s and ’80s. I went along on a half-day Soweto tour booked through the Curiocity Backpackers hostel (350 rand) with about a dozen other people and found the experience more than worth the effort.

Our guide, Semphiwe, was sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, giving us all names in Zulu or Xhosa and ribbing us if we couldn’t pronounce them properly. He was from Soweto, and extremely proud of it, noting that it has over a million residents. And it was the only place, he said, where you could, at one point, find two Nobel Peace Prize winners (Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu) living on one street. “And they say it’s not safe!” he said, feigning exasperation.

We first stopped by Kliptown, one of Soweto’s poorest areas, and the Little Rose Center, a school and youth center. The overwhelming poverty of the shanties and tin-roof shacks of Kliptown was sobering — we spent roughly 30 minutes winding through the mazelike, dirt roads, distinguished only by the odd spray-painted wooden board or the rusted-out iron coils of a mattress.

We also saw the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in the Orlando West neighborhood (admission, 30 rand), which documents the killing of 12-year-old Pieterson by police, a key moment during the 1976 Soweto Uprising; and we saw the Apartheid Museum (85 rand), about 10 miles east of Orlando West, which captures the nuances and the horrors of that system. A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to Mandela, including old letters and personal effects as well as a replica of his tiny cell on Robben Island.

Another benefit of riding the Shosholoza Meyl was having a sharpened sense of movement and travel. Harry Emanuel, a fellow passenger, noted that border crossings are more meaningful when done by land. “On a plane you just stamp your passport,” he said. “Physically crossing you actually get a sense that, oh, this is a big deal.”

Meals, generally an attempt at something upscale, were good overall. A dinner might start with soup followed by a hake filet, leg of lamb, then tiramisù, and finally a plate of cheese and biscuits. It was not quite gourmet, but on par with, say, first-class airline food. Service was friendly and helpful.

Trains force your brain to slow down. With no internet access and the knowledge you’ll be on a train for an entire day, you have to mine your creative resources. I played a game of Scrabble — in Afrikaans, no less — with a friendly woman named Lueen and her two friends. My traveling companion and I sat for hours after dinner quizzing each other on world capitals. I finished an actual book for the first time in longer than I care to admit. It was wonderful and sad — wonderful to recapture this organic way of having fun, and sad to realize I’d likely soon be back to my old ways.

I also spent a decent amount of time just looking out the window, as the scenery gradually morphed from flat grassland to sharp mountain peaks. I usually travel by plane, an environment where people are usually slightly harried and irritated. Here, it was the opposite: We chatted, drank coffee, relaxed and counted ourselves lucky to take part in such a special journey.

It is unclear whether any law enforcement agencies are investigating allegations against Mr. Toback. The Manhattan district attorney’s office does not typically comment on investigations, and it declined to do so Friday.

They classify weight status by using body mass index, a formula based on height and weight that doesn’t distinguish muscle from fat. Most important, critics say, such analyses don’t take fitness level or physical activity into account.

Other studies have found a higher rate of heart failure among obese individuals, said Dr. Carl Lavie, the medical director of cardiac rehabilitation and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans. But when it comes to coronary heart disease outcomes, studies that take both weight and physical fitness into account have concluded that “fitness is more important than fatness,” at least for the moderately obese, he said.

“For the very large number of people who are overweight or mildly obese, I don’t think it’s doomsday if they can keep themselves out of the low fitness level,” Dr. Lavie said.

Dr. Caleyachetty, the author of the new paper, agreed that the lack of information about fitness and exercise was “an important caveat.”

“Those people who are metabolically healthy, obese and vigorously active may have a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease,” he conceded.

Critics say that’s an important message to convey, because many people will find it easier to embark on an exercise regimen and stick with it than to lose weight and maintain the weight loss.

“I do think that’s a better message than telling people, ‘You better not gain weight,’” Dr. Lavie said. “People aren’t trying to gain weight. They’re not trying to get to be obese. A better message would be to tell people that if they get themselves to be more physically active, they can improve their prognosis, despite carrying a few extra pounds. That’s a better message, and a more obtainable message.”

But Jennifer W. Bea, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona Cancer Center who was a co-author of an editorial accompanying the new study, said, “we haven’t heard the whole story yet” and questioned whether someone can be obese but “metabolically healthy.”

“Obesity itself is a metabolic disorder,” Dr. Bea said, noting that being overweight and obese is often associated with low-grade inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease, regardless of metabolic measures.

That doesn’t mean that weight trumps all. Indeed, the study found that individuals who were considered to be of normal weight but who had a single risk factor such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol were actually at greater risk for coronary heart disease than the healthy obese people.

“The messaging is always, ‘lose weight no matter what,’” said Patrick Bradshaw, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. “But when you’re at normal weight, you’re not given a lot of lifestyle guidance. Your doctor may say ‘exercise and eat right,’ but if you have these metabolic abnormalities you’re at higher risk of disease, and you may need more intensive lifestyle modifications — not to lose weight, but to improve health.”

One of the messages of this new paper “is that metabolic health is important regardless of your weight,” Dr. Bradshaw said.

That goes for people who are considered underweight as well. The new study found, for example, that underweight individuals with no metabolic problems were at higher risk for stroke than normal weight, overweight or obese people with no metabolic problems, and if underweight people had metabolic issues, their risk increased even further.

Interestingly, while the risks of being overweight and obese draw scrutiny, doctors are often at a loss to explain the risks of being too thin.",‘Fat but Fit’? The Controversy Continues,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/well/eat/fat-but-fit-the-controversy-continues.html

So many families here are having addiction problems with their loved ones, and they’re not focused on going to vote — even though those are the people that need it the most.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire cost of new enrollees under Medicaid expansion for the first three years and will continue to pay at least 90 percent. (States cover a significantly larger portion of the expenses of the regular Medicaid program.) The law allows any citizen with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level — $16,642 for an individual, $24,600 for a family of four — to qualify.

The main arguments for expanding the program here are that it would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without it.

But Mr. LePage and other opponents say that Maine should know better. The state undertook a more modest expansion of Medicaid in 2002, under former Gov. Angus King, an independent. Afterward, Maine struggled with budget shortfalls and fell behind on Medicaid payments to hospitals.

“People don’t want to acknowledge the unintended consequences that Maine has already experienced,” said Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to Mr. LePage who is serving as the spokesman for Welfare to Work, the committee leading the opposition. He said that even with the federal government paying most of the cost — a situation that could change if Congress eventually succeeds in repealing Obamacare — the state could owe close to $100 million a year, according to estimates from the LePage administration.

The Office of Program and Fiscal Review has estimated a lower state cost, about $54 million a year once the federal share drops to 90 percent in 2021. Maine would not receive the full 90 percent match for parents of young children because many already qualify for the program.

Maine’s legislature, which is controlled by Democrats in the House and Republicans, by one vote, in the Senate, could move to block the referendum if it were to pass, but since it voted for Medicaid expansion five times already, supporters and opponents alike believe it is unlikely to meddle.

Dozens of other Catalan officials were expected to be fired, but Enric Millo, the current representative of the central government in Catalonia, told Catalunya Radio on Saturday that he expected Madrid to make “the minimum possible” staff changes.

Mr. Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan capital, Barcelona, insisted that Mr. Rajoy was removing a democratically elected government.

“These are decisions contrary to the will expressed by the citizens of our country at the ballot boxes,” he said. He added that the central government in Madrid “knows perfectly well that, in a democratic society, it is the Parliaments that choose or remove presidents.”

Madrid also took control of the regional police force and fired the regional police chief, Maj. Josep Lluís Trapero.

So far, there is no indication that Catalan officials will resist their removal. Pere Soler, the ousted director general of the Catalan police force, sent a letter to his officers, expressing regret over his removal and thanking them for their work.

Major Trapero — who is facing possible sedition charges after he was accused of failing to stop protesters last month from encircling national police officers — also wrote to his colleagues. He reminded them that their task was to “guarantee the safety of everybody” in the coming days, should the political crisis spur more unrest.

As Mr. Puigdemont spoke on Saturday, throngs of Spaniards gathered in central Madrid — many of them waving flags, some wrapped in them — to protest Catalonia’s unilateral declaration of independence.

“We are resisting xenophobia,” one man said into a microphone, before shouting: “Long live Catalonia, long live the king, long live Spain.”

The crowd chanted: “Don’t fool us, Catalonia. You are part of Spain.”

Many protesters said that the Madrid government had to enforce its decision to trigger Article 155. Some said that, if necessary, the army should be sent in, though most said it would not come to that.

“They need to apply the law,” said Chema Martinez, 22, who described himself as a patriot and devout Catholic and wore a Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart of Jesus stamped on its center.

“The army is there to defend Spain,” he said. “They should send in the army to Catalonia; that’s what needs to be done.”

At one point, the Spanish national anthem began to play, and many who had been quietly listening as they sat on the curb silently stood up.

Agueda Rivera, 77, tears streaming down her face, said, “I’m crying. I’m crying for my Spain.”

On Friday, Mr. Rajoy announced that new Catalan elections would be held on Dec. 21, the earliest possible date, in an apparent bid to show frustrated Catalans that Madrid wanted to avoid prolonging a constitutional crisis.

By limiting Madrid’s control over Catalonia to 55 days, analysts said, Mr. Rajoy and his allies were hoping to quickly turn the tables on the separatists, who staged an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

“It’s Rajoy’s attempt to regain the democratic initiative, but also a surprisingly risky bet that he can really beat the independence movement,” said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher.

“Whether it works will depend on the level of resistance to Madrid in the coming weeks, which perhaps won’t be that high given that people are exhausted and need a break.”

Albert Rivera, the national leader of Ciudadanos, the party that has been Mr. Rajoy’s main ally in fighting secessionism, told a party conference on Saturday morning, “We will now come out to beat them, but by voting.”

The December elections, he said, were an opportunity for “all the Catalans who have been silenced by nationalism,” after opponents of independence mostly boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum.

“We will now claim the right to vote in freedom,” Mr. Rivera added, “to show the world that this is a free and democratic country.”

Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of the Catalan public television station, TV3, said that it remained to be seen how much practical control Mr. Rajoy could exert over Catalan institutions.

“We live in an uncertain moment,” Mr. Sanchis said in his office. “We now have two parallel legitimacies and we still don’t know which one controls the Catalan institutions.”

“The key thing now is to discover what pressure the Madrid government will now exert,” he added. “In the coming days, we’ll find out.”

Jordi Borda, the deputy director of Catalunya Radio, said a crucial test would come on Monday.

“If the Catalan ministers go to work on Monday and manage to work normally, it will be a strong step towards consolidating what the Catalan parliament voted on yesterday,” Mr. Borda said.

“If Monday is a normal day,” he said, “it will be a victory for the independence movement.”

Spain’s attorney general is expected to take legal action against Mr. Puigdemont and other leading separatists on Monday, possibly on grounds of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of as long as 30 years.

Joan Queralt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Barcelona, said he expected the attorney general to act forcefully.

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Progressive intelligentsia “is moralist against one half of the world, but accords to the revolutionary movement an indulgence that is realist in the extreme,” the French scholar Raymond Aron wrote in “The Opium of the Intellectuals” in 1955. “How many intellectuals have come to the revolutionary party via the path of moral indignation, only to connive ultimately at terror and autocracy?”

On Thursday, I noted that intellectuals have a long history of making fools of themselves with their political commitments, and that the phenomenon is fully bipartisan.

But the consequences of the left’s fellow-traveling and excuse-making are more dangerous. Venezuela is today in the throes of socialist dictatorship and humanitarian ruin, having been cheered along its predictable and unmerry course by the usual progressive suspects.

One of those suspects, Jeremy Corbyn, may be Britain’s next prime minister, in part because a generation of Britons has come of age not knowing that the line running from “progressive social commitments” to catastrophic economic results is short and straight.

Bernie Sanders captured the heart, if not yet the brain, of the Democratic Party last year by portraying “democratic socialism” as nothing more than an extension of New Deal liberalism. But the Vermont senator also insists that “the business model of Wall Street is fraud.” Efforts to criminalize capitalism and financial services also have predictable results.

It’s a bitter fact that the most astonishing strategic victory by the West in the last century turns out to be the one whose lessons we’ve never seriously bothered to teach, much less to learn. An ideology that at one point enslaved and immiserated roughly a third of the world collapsed without a fight and was exposed for all to see. Yet we still have trouble condemning it as we do equivalent evils. And we treat its sympathizers as romantics and idealists, rather than as the fools, fanatics or cynics they really were and are.

Feeling anxious, Ms. Ramirez started smoking up to two packs a day. “I used to wake up smoking cigarettes,” she recalled. “Smoking made me calm.”

Ms. Ramirez had also experienced a long bout of grief. In one year, she had buried several close relatives who had contracted HIV from infected needles. “There were so many funerals,” she said. She lost five of her siblings in the space of a few years.

Ms. Ramirez was also a marijuana smoker, but she began increasingly using the drug by herself, multiple times a day. “I used to have to do it just to move around, cook, clean, to do whatever it was I wanted to do,” she said.

It took doctors two years to find a prescription that eased her schizophrenia symptoms without drastic side effects. During this time, she gained about 100 pounds, doubling her weight.

For about a decade, Ms. Ramirez has received mental health and wellness services through Brooklyn Community Services and its predecessor. When she started coming to the agency, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she often slept sprawled on a covered radiator by the window in the common area and did not socialize.

Outside the agency, she continued smoking marijuana. But Ms. Ramirez said she hated how people would look at her and comment on her red eyes and the stench of her clothes.

In 2010, she began an integrated dual disorder treatment program to combat her mental illness and her drug use.

“It was like coming out of a cloud,” Ms. Ramirez said of quitting marijuana. Over the years, she regained her senses of taste and smell, which had been dulled by smoking. “It was like I was waking up,” she added.

Within a few months of kicking her drug habit, she joined a weekly smoking-cessation group through Brooklyn Community Services. “I quit cold turkey,” she said. Most in the group used nicotine patches to transition, but not Ms. Ramirez. “I didn’t want to leave one addiction for another,” she said, adding: “I wanted to make that change. I was ready to make that change.”

Art therapy, offered by the organization, helped her through the withdrawal symptoms, she said. Ms. Ramirez, who had drawn since she was a teenager, took to the method quickly. And in 2012, the organization featured Ms. Ramirez’s pencil and ink drawings at its annual art show. Her series of bodiless faces in pinks, blues and grays depicted long lashes blooming from almond eyes, hairstyles of tight circles, the faces surrounded by hearts and cubes.

Her mother, Carmen Rivera, came to the show. “She said, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Ms. Gwinnell, the recovery specialist, recalled.

Ms. Ramirez is grateful, too. “Thank you for getting me back,” she told Ms. Gwinnell recently.

In May, Ms. Ramirez, a mother of three adult children, moved into a one-bedroom apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the first home she has had to herself since her diagnosis about 25 years ago. Ms. Ramirez receives monthly $735 in Social Security Income and $150 in food stamps and pays $162 in subsidized rent. In July, Brooklyn Community Services used $300 from the Neediest Cases Funds to buy her, among other household items, two sets of window curtains, a lamp and a shower curtain.

After living with family for so long, Ms. Ramirez said she particularly enjoyed having full rein over the kitchen. No longer the shadow on the radiator, she likes socializing and sharing favorite Puerto Rican dishes like fritters and flan with others at the organization.

Ms. Ramirez, who dropped out of school in 10th grade when she was pregnant with her first child, said she would like to earn her high school equivalency diploma. Having previously worked in fast food and other industries, she wants to pursue a career as a chef. She might also try to display her artwork in a neighborhood gallery.

But for now, she is focused on her health. About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services. She has not been hospitalized for over 10 years. In addition to drawing, she meditates frequently.

“You have to put your part in,” she said of remaining drug-free. “A miracle doesn’t just walk in the door.

Are we somehow complicit when we encounter art in a safe, gilded house? Or, in fact, can grappling with the arts, including this powerful opera, be a way to take action and exert will?

In this audacious opera — for which Tom Cairns, the director of the production, wrote the libretto in collaboration with Mr. Adès — the music digs deep. Mr. Adès’s wild, searing score explores the emotional undercurrents of the story and fleshes out the horror of the characters’ situation.

My one reservation about the opera when I first heard it was that to some degree, Mr. Adès explored the dark side of Buñuel’s tale, which has been seen as a bitter critique of elite classes during Franco’s regime in Spain, at the expense of its bizarrely comic elements.

But after hearing it at the Met, I feel different. Mr. Adès’s thorny, modernist music, played with crackling precision and color by the orchestra, bristled with manic, almost madcap, energy.

Take the crucial opening scenes, which hew pretty closely to the film. The servants of the house, who somehow sense disaster coming, have fled; and the hostess, Lucía de Nobile (the bright-voiced soprano Amanda Echalaz) is frantic with embarrassment. Her prickly husband, Edmundo (the suave tenor Joseph Kaiser), is also utterly indignant.

But Mr. Adès captures both the tension and absurdity of the crisis in a complex ensemble. The hosts greet their guests with unctuous exchanges, while the visitors, in overlapping and comically elongated phrases, voice refrains of “Enchanted, enchanted,” as the orchestra erupts with jumpy outbursts.

Video

The effect here is compounded by a prankish yet gripping touch in Mr. Cairns’s brilliant staging. The set (by Hildegard Bechtler, who also designed the costumes) shows a salon, with fine couches and glittering tables, framed by a large wooden structure that resembles an opera house proscenium. Only when the guests arrived onstage did the chandeliers in the Met’s auditorium start rising to the roof.

Though “The Exterminating Angel” is a true ensemble piece, Mr. Adès gives distinct character traits and defining musical moments to most of the 15 solo roles. The coloratura soprano Audrey Luna, whose stratospheric upper range was put to use by Mr. Adès in his previous opera “The Tempest” (presented at the Met in 2012) excels as Leticia, an opera singer who had starred in the performance the guests have attended: The dinner party is in her honor.

But as hours and days go by, and everyone becomes increasingly confused and degraded, Leticia unravels, dispatching accusations in vocal bursts that reach screechy highs, yet somehow sound angelic.

Another guest, Blanca, a pianist (the mezzo-soprano Christine Rice), agrees to play something. In the film, the character performs a snappy 18th-century keyboard piece. Mr. Adès substitutes his own haunting variations on a song from the Ladino tradition of Sephardic Jews, music that captures the ambiguity of the moment.

It’s as if Blanca is searching through music’s past for clarity and willpower, yet speaking in a confused modern voice. Blanca arrives with her husband, Alberto (baritone Rod Gilfry), a conductor, and Leticia’s colleague, who proceeds to fall asleep on a couch while confusion reigns.

The soprano Sally Matthews brings a radiant voice and natural allure to Silvia de Ávila, a young widowed aristocrat who has a strangely close relationship with her prissy brother, Francesco (the vibrant countertenor Iestyn Davies).

Two tragic guests, in the face of unreality, seek solace together. Beatriz (the soprano Sophie Bevan) and Eduardo (the tenor David Portillo) are engaged and utterly absorbed in themselves. But Mr. Adès enshrouds them in the opera’s most rapturous music, an extended duet with sighing vocal lines and quizzical orchestral sonorities. In a suicide pact, the couple enjoy their first night of love in a closet, where they are later discovered dead.

The veteran bass John Tomlinson commands the stage as the elderly Doctor Conde, who is accompanied by his terminally ill patient Leonora, a needy woman obsessed with the occult, here the compelling mezzo-soprano Alice Coote.

As an opera composer, Mr. Adès often has the orchestra hug every note and syllable of a vocal line. This stylistic trait could easily be overdone. But the chords and sonorities he comes up with at once buttress and shake up vocal lines, so the effect, in his hands, lends intriguing dramatic complexity. Over all, this riveting, breathless, score — full of quick-cutting shifts, pointillist bursts, and episodes of ballistic intensity — may be his best work.

The anguished scene that will stay with me for a long while came late, a moment of motherly longing, when Silvia, now grimy, haggard and delirious, thinks about her little boy. She sings a fractured lullaby while caressing the head of a dead sheep (and how actual sheep come into the picture, I won’t give away). Silvia sounds as if she is recalling some distant, old hymn tune. Yet the disjointed orchestra grumbles ominously in its depths while miniature violins play weirdly high, skittish sounds.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a “clapper boy,” holding the slate up before a scene.
His first features as cinematographer, “Another Sky,” set in North Africa, and “Passing Stranger,” a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.
“It’s so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think you’re running along the ground, and then suddenly you’re jumping over the bushes and rising into the air,” Mr. Lassally said.
“He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights,” Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, “and it was an amazing experience to watch him.","Mr. Lassally worked with the director James Ivory on the period dramas that were the signature of Merchant Ivory Productions, like “The Wild Party” (1975), set in Hollywood of the 1920s, and “Heat and Dust” (1983), set partly in India of the 1920s. He shot comedies like “The Great Bank Hoax” (1978). He did the occasional television movie, including “The Man Upstairs,” a 1992 comic drama on CBS that starred Katharine Hepburn and Ryan O’Neal.

He could make even a mundane setting interesting, as Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted in his review of the 1969 film “3 Into 2 Won’t Go.”

“Walter Lassally,” Mr. Canby wrote, “who photographed some of Tony Richardson’s best films (‘The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner’), must, I assume, receive some of the credit for transforming a suburban house into a locale as fascinating and mysterious and necessary to this film as Monument Valley used to be to John Ford.”

Mr. Lassally was born on Dec. 18, 1926, in Berlin. His father was an engineer who sometimes used film as an adjunct to his work as he studied mechanical processes.

The family, Mr. Lassally said in an interview with the website Web of Stories, was not Jewish but had Jewish ancestors, making them unwelcome in their own country as the Nazis came to power. In 1939, just before the outbreak of war, they emigrated to England.

There was no immediate word on his survivors.

As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a “clapper boy,” holding the slate up before a scene. Riverside soon went bankrupt, but Mr. Lassally was on his way; in 1950 he was given the chance to shoot a fire-prevention documentary called “Every Five Minutes.”

He also began writing about moviemaking, becoming identified with the British documentary film movement known as Free Cinema.

His first features as cinematographer, “Another Sky,” set in North Africa, and “Passing Stranger,” a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.

“He started his career in documentaries and applied some of those techniques to his feature work in groundbreaking ways,” Stephen Pizzello, editor in chief and publisher of American Cinematographer magazine, said by email. “The mission of the Free Cinema movement was to produce realistic films about the working class, and its practitioners shot in authentic locations with relatively unknown actors and actresses; they were the guerrilla filmmakers of their day.”

In 1961 Mr. Richardson, who died in 1991, asked Mr. Lassally to shoot “A Taste of Honey,” a drama about a pregnant teenager, which Mr. Pizzello said was the first major British feature shot entirely on location. The next year the two made “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,” about a boy at an English reform school.

In 1963 came “Tom Jones,” a romantic romp, based on the Henry Fielding novel, set in the 18th century. It had a particularly memorable scene involving a stag hunt, which included countless hounds running alongside riders on galloping horses. Mr. Lassally found a thrilling way to render the scene, mixing conventional images with shots taken from a helicopter and a camera mounted so low on a truck that it could look up at the riders’ faces.

“It’s so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think you’re running along the ground, and then suddenly you’re jumping over the bushes and rising into the air,” Mr. Lassally said. “So that was a very effective technique, and it’s caused a lot of comment after. People always ask me, ‘How did you do that?’ ”

The cinematographer Tom Houghton worked as a gaffer with Mr. Lassally on later films, including the marital drama “Too Far to Go” (1979), and found it a vital learning experience.

“He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights,” Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, “and it was an amazing experience to watch him. The more I worked with him, the more I understood what he was going for. He knew how to create subtleties and nuances in the midst of simplicity, and he brought that sensibility from the smaller projects to the bigger films.”

In a 2015 interview with Radio Prague, Mr. Lassally summed up the importance of the look of a film.

“To me cinema is visual,” he said. “In a good film, you should be able to turn off the soundtrack and still get the story. Nowadays it’s the other way around. Most of the information tends to be in the dialogue and not in the pictures, and that’s not cinema to me.”","Walter Lassally, Cinematographer Who Won Oscar for ‘Zorba,’ Dies at 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/walter-lassally-oscar-winning-cinematographer-dies-at-90.html

“I always tried to keep my expenses low when I was a dancer, because you kind of never knew when the next gig would be,” he said. “But when I started writing and had some success, I wanted to have a bedroom door that closed, in part because when you write at home as I do, your laptop and your job are always 10 feet away.”

When you move to New York, that’s when you can get a dog, Mr. Federle’s mother always told him. “Instead of getting a dog, I painted my ceilings pink,” he said. The foyer walls were brushed with broad stripes of brown and white; the radiators, depending on the location, with blue; the doors with black; the floor with white.

Name: Tim Federle Age 37 Occupation Writer Sizing Things Up “I was once in New Orleans, and I texted my decorator friend a picture of a giant piece of furniture and asked, ‘Is this right for my entryway?’ And he wrote back, ‘You’re not Belle and you’re not caught in the Beast’s castle, so you’re not allowed to buy that.’”

“I have this dear friend, Nick Olsen, an interior designer who’s my decorating equivalent of a horse whisperer,” Mr. Federle said. “One thing Nick taught me was that if you don’t like the way something looks, and you don’t have the budget to take it down to the studs, paint it.

“I didn’t have the money to be able to say, ‘Hey, Nick, can you do my whole place?’” Mr. Federle added. “But I could say, ‘Am I crazy to want to do yellow curtains?’ And Nick would say, ‘No, you’re not crazy, and this is the yellow fabric you should get. And if you’re getting yellow curtains, paint the back of your bookcase yellow, too.’” Done and done.

Mr. Federle’s rehearsal hat from “Gypsy” hangs in the living room, and a few “Tim Federle” nameplates, once part of the cast boards in theater lobbies, are on display in the bookcase. But the aesthetic tilts more toward midcentury modern than toward mild narcissism.

Evidence includes the turquoise kitchen table and the Finn Juhl armchair that is upholstered in geometric-patterned yellow-and-pink curtains Mr. Federle bought at an estate sale. The chair is as much a pat on the back as a place to sit.

So what I started to do when something great happened was to buy something for my apartment to commemorate that great thing.”

Thus, the Finn Juhl chair — a hosanna when Mr. Federle was cast in a San Francisco production of the musical “White Christmas.” When his cocktail recipe book “Tequila Mockingbird” did well, he celebrated by buying a sofa, an armchair and a rug. And upon completing the first draft of “Life Is Like a Musical,” Mr. Federle bought a large abstract painting at an antiques shop in Hudson, N.Y.

“In publishing, as in showbiz, you don’t know if something is going to hit or tank, but I thought, ‘Well, at least I’ll have a painting,’” he said.

Because Mr. Federle has clocked a considerable amount of time on and around stage sets, he has a sense of compatible colors, he said, and of what sorts of furnishings play well together. Where he founders is with proportions.

“I’ll say, ‘This should be a four-foot sofa, right?’ and my friend Nick will say, ‘Uh, Tim, it should be a nine-foot sofa.’”

Experts have long suspected that the North’s arsenal includes VX, which is far more toxic than sarin. The gruesome murder in February of Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong-nam — a brazen killing in a Malaysian airport that prosecutors say was carried out by two women, trained by North Korean agents, who rubbed the victim’s face with VX — has dispelled any doubts that the North has the chemical. Unlike sarin, VX is “persistent,” meaning it lingers in the environment rather than disperses. The mustard gas that drenched World War I battlefields is the original persistent chemical.

Kim Jong-nam’s murder also raises the specter of new proliferation of chemical arms. The fact that VX made its way out of North Korea undetected to another country could indicate that Mr. Kim would use the North’s extensive criminal smuggling networks to secretly assist other nations, or nonstate actors, in obtaining or producing it.

The chemical menace from North Korea recalls a time when chemical weapons posed far more of a global threat than they do today. The doctrine of strategic deterrence — maintaining stockpiles of powerful weapons to keep a similarly armed adversary in check — didn’t begin with nuclear weapons; rather, it emerged from gas warfare in World War I.

In the war’s aftermath, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 banned chemical warfare but not chemical weapons. The rationale for that apparent contradiction was that rogue nations might disregard international law and use chemical arms to attack cities and civilian populations in much the way North Korea threatens to do today. The way to deter such attacks, the logic went, was to maintain a stockpile. If signatory nations suffered a chemical attack, they could then retaliate in kind.

The United States Senate, convinced that the agreement was folly in a dangerous world, refused to ratify the pact. Many nations developed sophisticated chemical weapons programs, as well as biological weapons. By the 1990s, the United States had an arsenal of 27,700 metric tons of chemical agents, and Russia had at least 40,000.

The threat of chemical warfare diminished because of the far greater power of nuclear weapons, but also because of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlawed the weapons altogether. The United States and South Korea are among the 192 nations party to the agreement, and they agreed to destroy their chemical arsenals. North Korea did not join.

After President Bashar al-Assad of Syria was accused of using sarin in 2013, he joined the convention. He promptly violated it with more chemical barrages, including the sarin attack in Khan Sheikhoun in April that spurred President Trump to retaliate with a missile strike.

A similar show of force against Mr. Kim’s regime could have catastrophic consequences for South Korea. The North’s nuclear arms are one layer of deterrence against attack; the chemical arms are a second. Many experts say that Mr. Kim, if attacked with conventional weapons as a warning or a pre-emptive strike, could see chemical weapons as a way to retaliate without escalating to nuclear weapons.

After the Syrian sarin attack in April, Mr. Trump used unusually emotional terms in his speech about his decision to launch the missile strike. “Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack,” he said. “No child of God should ever suffer such horror.”

Let’s hope that the president’s memory of those searing images will make him think twice before attacking Kim Jong-un. The fate of millions of South Koreans within range of Mr. Kim’s chemical arsenal may depend on it.",North Korea and the Threat of Chemical Warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/north-korean-chemical-weapons.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can.

Even that still doesn’t sound quite right; Mr. Colborne wasn’t prone to panic. Their children wonder if he had some sort of medical emergency that forced them to seek help. Their car was near the bodies, keys in the ignition and a few thousand dollars and some clothes stashed inside.

“We still want to think in our minds that they were together, holding hands,” Ms. Cooper said. “Which they were not.”

At their funeral, another couple said they had seen the Colbornes drive away from the apartment as they were doing the same thing, but they turned in different directions when exiting the complex, one couple toward safety and the other, death.

“I obsessed over my father in this cold black water, wondering what his final thoughts were,” said Christine Colborne. “It killed me.”

A few miles away, a 79-year-old widow and mother of six, Beatrice Spagnuolo, was in her small home on Grimsby Street in Midland Beach as the storm approached. She had survived colon cancer, but she was frail. Her next-door neighbor was her best friend, practically family.

When she was raising her children, Ms. Spagnuolo had preached the importance of solid civil-service jobs, and they listened. She would come to count among them a police officer, a subway motorman, a construction foreman and a sanitation worker.

One of her daughters, a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, was asleep on her couch as the storm approached. Ms. Spagnuolo’s house was on her regular route.

Her son Vincent called. “I said, ‘You’ve got to get the hell out of there — get your stuff and go,’” he said. “The water was coming up to her knees.”

She obeyed. Her daughter helped her into their car and was pulling away from the house. Then the mother told her to stop.

“Let me go get my pills,” she told her daughter. She went back inside.

A huge wave struck the block. “All the lights went black,” Mr. Spagnuolo said, repeating what his sister later told the family. “There were wires from the telephone pole, electrocuting. Sparks.”

When the waters receded, Ms. Spagnuolo’s body was found in the house. Next door, her old friend, Anastasia Rispoli, 73, was dead, too.

Halloween was the next day. Mr. Spagnuolo, who lived in Brooklyn, had a young daughter who had expected to go trick-or-treating. “She was crying,” Mr. Spagnuolo recalled. “So I took her around the corner. I had to put on a happy attitude for her. It was terrible.”

The death of Ms. Spagnuolo affected her children in different ways. Some have become more reclusive, skipping family gatherings at Christmas and other holidays. Most of them, like Mr. Spagnuolo, cannot visit the block of Grimsby where she lived. He lights a candle at Mass for his mother, who was a regular at church.

“You relive it,” he said. “Every year they have, like, a walk down by the beach there. They play a bagpiper. It’s tough to go. Something you don’t get over, the way she died.”

The house, unsafe, was razed. The lot remains empty. Someone else delivers mail on the block — not Ms. Spagnuolo’s daughter, who, like her brother in sanitation, can’t go back. Not for work, not for anything.

In the case of the Colbornes, it was Mrs. Colborne’s daughter, Ms. Mikkelsen, who settled their affairs on Staten Island, where she grew up and couldn’t get away from fast enough after college. But a string of fluke accidents — a bad pipe, a neighbor’s leak — has delayed the sale of their home and kept her reluctantly coming back up from Florida for weeks at a time.

“It’s almost like somebody up above doesn’t want me to move on,” she said.

Finally, this summer brought interest from a buyer.

“I went in, I said goodbye to the apartment, and I don’t ever plan on going back there again,” she said. “Staten Island represents the death of my mother.”

In her darkest times, she forced herself to think about other victims. A mother lost two sons, ages 2 and 4, when waves swept them from her arms on Staten Island. That mother, like others, declined to speak last week. Ms. Mikkelsen has never met her.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

The bad conscience of the cultural elite is hardly a new concern in European cinema (or American journalism, if we want to go there), and “The Square,” which won the Palme d’Or in May, uses some of the shock-the-bourgeoisie tactic refined, in recent years, by his fellow Cannes laureates Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier.

If Mr. Ostlund lacks Mr. Haneke’s rigor and Mr. von Trier’s sadism, he at least has a sense of humor. “The Square,” ragged and headlong, plays like a series of elaborately staged sketch-comedy routines. Or, closer to its own concerns, like an anthology of performance art pieces. Just about everything that happens to Christian has a conceptual dimension, an element of coy self-consciousness, that makes you wonder whether it’s just something that happened or a carefully planned and theorized happening.

Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian’s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world?

In this crowded mix, a dark horse has appeared: the former Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson. He was driven from office in April 2016 when he became the first major casualty of the leaked Panama Papers. They revealed that he and his wife had set up a company in the British Virgin Islands.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson had come to power on promises to clear out corruption. But the Panama Papers leak, though it revealed nothing illegal, suggested an unseemly conflict of interest, and an outraged public called for his ouster.

For days, Icelanders gathered outside Parliament and hurled fish and yogurt in protest. He eventually stepped down, prompting snap elections. It seemed as if he would never lead his country again.

But Mr. Gunnlaugsson is back. He ditched his old party, the Progressives, and formed the Center Party, a populist outfit promising to squeeze the financial sector and redistribute the wealth.

He has campaigned under the banner of an Icelandic horse, gaining surprising momentum. His charisma, his threats to take news media outlets to court for supposed unfair treatment and his promises to wrest wealth from Iceland’s banks have resonated in his largely rural base.

“He has talked his way out of the scandal,” said Johannes Kr. Kristjansson, the Reykjavik Media editor who revealed Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s family ties to the Panama Papers. “You can compare him to Donald Trump. He has a group of people who will elect him no matter what he says or does.”

In one fiery debate, Mr. Gunnlaugsson stormed offstage, refusing to shake his rivals’ hands. As prime minister, he showed an eccentric flair, inviting counterparts to play with Legos and once meeting Barack Obama in one polished shoe and one sneaker.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson declined multiple requests for an interview, but he has been adamant that he did no wrong. In fact, he claims he is a victim of a conspiracy initiated by Iceland’s political and financial establishment in cahoots with the financier George Soros.

An outright victory for Mr. Gunnlaugsson remains unlikely. He’s hoping his party does well enough to become part of the governing coalition, political observers say. But he’s no kingmaker.

Some experts say it will take a rickety coalition of as many as four parties to form a new government. If the Left Greens win, Mr. Gunnlaugsson would be an unlikely coalition partner. They appear to be more open to teaming with a revived Social Democrat Party and, potentially, the Pirate Party — a nerdy group of futurists, hackers, anarchists and poets.

The anti-establishment Pirates capitalized on the anger over corruption and Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s ouster to take second place in snap general elections last October. But they also drove his successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, to quit as prime minister after his center-right Progressive Party’s share of Parliament shrunk to eight seats from 19.

Among the notable parties in the current race is Bright Future, known as a group of idealistic hipsters who say they shun the idea of becoming career politicians. The party is on course to lose most, if not all, of its seats, polls suggest, after helping to precipitate one of the pivotal twists in Icelandic politics.

The vote, the second snap election in a year, turns on an episode involving Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson. Mr. Benediktsson’s father had written a letter of reference for a friend seeking a form of civil pardon after being sentenced in 2004 to prison on charges of raping his stepdaughter for over 12 years.

The Justice Ministry covered up the letter, critics say, but the secret found its way to the news media. It was the final straw for one of the coalition partners, Bright Future, which peeled away and brought down the government.

In September, eight months after Mr. Benediktsson’s administration came to power, he called for new elections, lamenting, “We have lost the majority.”

But another scandal landed just as the campaign got underway, salting the nation’s old financial wounds. Journalists released some of Mr. Benediktsson’s personal financial records from the days before the banking collapse.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Smithwick’s adviser, Jakob Vinther, went to China and took high resolution images of Sinosauropteryx specimens under specially polarized light, which brought out their colors.

The dark feathers — the only ones that were preserved on the fossils — were filled with melanin, the same pigment that colors our hair and skin. It is a strong molecule that is resistant to decay and can survive in fossils for hundreds of millions of years.

Mr. Smithwick mapped the pigmented feathers on the fossils, finding that the Sinosauropteryx had brownish feathers covering its back and sides that stopped about halfway down its body. The rest of the feathers were most likely lightly colored.

The color pattern is a form of camouflage known as “countershading,” and on the Sinosauropteryx the transition from dark to light happened relatively high on the body. Mr. Smithwick said that the pattern could provide insight into the type of environment where the dinosaur lived.

He made 3D models of the dinosaur’s color shading and tested them under different types of light to see where they would perform best as camouflage. He found that the pattern was most useful in open environments where sunlight is coming straight from above with little interference.

When sunlight illuminates an animal’s top, it also keeps its underside in shadow, he said. This means that when something is looking at it, whether a predator or prey, the animal is seen as a three-dimensional object.

More Reporting on Paleontology

But countershading distorts the shadows in a way that makes the animal look less three-dimensional, and harder to spot. Animals that live in open, grassy environments have sharp transitions high on their body, from dark to light. But those that live in wooded or forested areas, like deer, tend to have a more gradual transition that appears much lower on the body.

The research suggests that countershading is not a modern evolutionary development, but a timeless camouflage technique.

Mr. Smithwick added that the dark feathers around the eyes indicate that Sinosauropteryx had “bandit masks,” most famously seen in raccoons, but also in some badgers, ferrets and red pandas.

Researchers tend to think mammals use the patches as warning signs that tell predators they are aggressive and not to be messed with. But Mr. Smithwick thinks Sinosauropteryx used its eye patches either as camouflage or to block glare, like athletes who paint dark stripes under their eyes to reduce incoming sunlight.

Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the study, said the research was a leap forward in paleontologists’ understanding of Sinosauropteryx.

“We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped,” Dr. Brusatte said in an email. “These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.”",A Turkey-Size Dinosaur With a Raccoon-Like Bandit Mask,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/science/dinosaur-raccoon-bandit-mask.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

And the Jews, lo and behold, are still around, still worrying, still making trouble and laughing, like Shagrir. Day after day peace is still dying, but not yet dead, between Israelis and Palestinians. Nothing dies easily these days.

So there is hope and cause to celebrate and be thankful. America is still “this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country,” as Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, put it the other day; and the world’s anti-American elites still cry out: “Yankee, go home — and take our baby with you!”

Lament grows tiresome, as does a very high and righteous moral tone. Life is a curve, not a straight line. Of all the virtues, surely stoicism, decency and forgiveness rate near the top — particularly in a culture of facile complaint, indecent vanity and vindictive piling-on. Silence seems to me a near-forgotten quality.

But I could be wrong. That is always a possibility, and, in this line of work, a very public one.

Then there is the consolation of unintended consequences. Take the British referendum vote to leave the European Union. This was an extraordinary, voluntary act of self-harm from a country previously more renowned for pragmatism than over-the-cliff auto-propulsion. No word existed for such odd behavior so one had to be invented: Brexit.

This, in turn, has given rise to the need for a dictionary definition. This one appears on inktank.fi: “The undefined being negotiated by the unprepared in order to get the unspecified for the uninformed.”

It’s not over yet.

And again, when it comes to unintended consequences, there’s the real possibility that Germany will end up with a foreign minister named Cem Ozdemir after elections last month that were marked by a strong showing by the rightist, xenophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Ozdemir, who is of Turkish descent, is a leader of the Green Party, now in coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel. I know Ozdemir, who was born into a working-class family and is a man of principle. He would be the perfect rebuke to the AfD.

I mentioned the revival of oratory. Here is Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, explaining his decision not to run again for his seat: “We must never regard as ‘normal’ the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country — the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth or decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve.”

Seedily costumed streetwalkers are a magnet to fans of “The Deuce,” about 1970s-era Times Square and the rise of its infant pornography industry. A leather-clad vixen grinds her stilettos into a fleshy male torso in one of the Steven Klein videos on display this month in “Fetish,” an exhibition organized in partnership with Visionaire magazine at the venerable Sotheby’s auction house. And a manga-inspired old-school prostitute, resplendent in shrill fuchsia fur, is among the vivid attractions of “Blade Runner 2049.”

The very prevalence of such images, overworked as they may be, is a testament to their durability. It is reason enough to look more closely at a position advanced by scholars and style arbiters alike: that the clothes we wear, or might like to wear, owe a very real debt to the world’s most ancient profession.

“Fashion right now is influenced by hookers,” said Anna Terrazas, the costume designer of “The Deuce.” “It’s not the other way around.” In a sea of eye-numbing conventionality, a maverick appearance is their signature. For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, “the point is to be seen.”

Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly. “There is an untold history of the relationship between sex workers and fashion,” said Rebecca Arnold, a fashion historian and lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. As fashion’s early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.

“The dubious woman could be more outlandish in her dress, and more experimental,” Ms. Arnold said. “She is allied with the idea of fashion as linked, not necessarily with the avant-garde, but with the beginning of new dress trends.”

Among the more fashionably progressive were the grandes horizontales of the 19th century, courtesans like Cora Pearl, a client of Charles Worth, the era’s first celebrity designer; and Catherine Walters (Skittles to her public), riveting on horseback as she paraded through Hyde Park sewn into her riding ensembles. Her style was much copied by noblewomen of the day.

More recently, to hear it from the prostitutes themselves, down-market variations on that patrician theme have been reduced to a series of musty clichés.

“Fashion doesn’t produce a vast range of ideas of what female sexuality looks like,” said Annie Sprinkle, a writer, sex educator and former prostitute. Stereotypes abound, she noted, with the upper echelons of the profession embodied by the aspirational up-and-comer cloaked in cashmere and silk and the role-play specialist dressed in pinstripes or a schoolgirl smock. The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.

It’s a visual code dating at least from the ’70s, tatty and archaic even then. Yet it is routinely resurrected by top-tier designers including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander Wang, each gussying up his offerings in sumptuous fabrics or in a mash-up of fetish, athletic and military gear, to tamp down the steamy aggression and make the look palatable to an affluent clientele.

The gambit works. “In the disco era, fashion was inspired by drag queens and prostitutes,” said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of Tom & Lorenzo, an opinionated fashion blog. “Fashion in general is always borrowing from street wear, and it doesn’t get more street wear than hooker.”

Those references, fixtures in the lexicon of style, are mainstream now. “Is there a specific sex worker look anymore?” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “Or does it all get pulled from the sexy pile at Forever 21?”

Like hip-hop and grunge, “the look has been normalized,” he said. “It’s never been more respectable.”

Or apparently more covetable.

In “The Deuce,” Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the prostitute Candy, swivels her hips in a working-girl wardrobe of short shorts, skimpy tops and lightly soiled coats. The actress reminisced the other day about her fixation with its centerpiece, a boxy fur chubby, a down-market variation on a famously scandalizing look introduced in the ’70s by Yves Saint Laurent, one inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the Rue Saint-Denis.

Seemingly unaware of its provenance, Ms. Gyllenhaal went on, “I wanted to wear that jacket in every scene.”

She wasn’t alone. “It became such an iconic piece on the set,” Ms. Terrazas said. “All of the girls were, like, ‘I want a jacket like that.’”

Pop performers like to tap the look as an assertion of power, often treading a fine line between owning their sexuality and trading on it. Cardi B, a retired “stripper-ho,” as she boasts, has been accused of glamorizing prostitution. She makes no apology.

Nor does Nicki Minaj, who turned up at a fashion show this fall wearing lace-up hot pants, over-the-knee boots and an ermine stole, her image an echo of Julia Roberts’s pre-makeover turnout in “Pretty Woman.”",It’s Always Fishnets Season Somewhere,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/sex-worker-prostitute-fashion-the-deuce-blade-runner.html

And by the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Friday night, the Astros had struck again, this time getting the best of another prestigious pitcher — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Yu Darvish. They shelled him for four runs and forced him to make him an unceremonious exit after getting only five outs.

The end result was a 5-3 victory that gave the Astros a lead of two games to one in the Series, with Game 4 scheduled for Saturday night at Minute Maid Park. The Astros are now 7-0 in their ballpark this postseason, and the Dodgers trail for the first time in a 2017 postseason series.

The victory displayed the dynamism of the Astros’ offense. After being limited to one run in Game 1, the Astros scored 12 over the next two games. The win also underscored the versatility of pitcher Brad Peacock. Used mainly as a starter this season, Peacock took over for Lance McCullers Jr. in the sixth and fired three and two-thirds hitless innings to complete the game, earning the first save of his career and ensuring that the work of the Astros’ lineup would hold up.

When Rosa Maria’s ambulance was stopped, her cousin acknowledged to the Border Patrol that the girl was undocumented.
Rosa Maria will be released to her family after being processed and placed in deportation proceedings, which could take weeks, her lawyer said.","“It’s the period when she needs me the most,” said Ms. de la Cruz, who cannot visit her daughter because she, too, could be arrested at a checkpoint. “I can’t help her. When I start to think about her, I start to get sad.”

In a year when President Trump’s hard line on illegal immigration has driven the number of immigration arrests up by more than 40 percent, Rosa Maria’s case has sped straight to the heart of the immigration-debate maelstrom.

Politicians have called for her release; activists have rallied, fund-raised and prayed on her behalf, questioning whether the Border Patrol violated its own policy against arresting immigrants at hospitals and why agents chose to expend so much time and manpower on a disabled 10-year-old girl.

The Border Patrol said it had followed proper procedure in Rosa Maria’s case. And to supporters of tougher enforcement, Rosa Maria and her family — no matter how sympathetic their situation — are the embodiment of the argument that a weak border only encourages immigrants to come to the United States and take advantage of its schools, health care and other resources.

“For crying out loud, we are not only paying to turn our country into the world’s orphanage, but we are also turning our nation into an emergency room for the rest of the world, where they drop off their kids or their elderly and we have to take care of them,” said George Rodriguez, a conservative activist in San Antonio. “It is not our fault, and we should not be on the hook for it.”

Rosa Maria, the second of three daughters, came to the United States from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, when she was 3 months old.

Her mother knew something was wrong when she held Rosa Maria for the first time: The baby was turning yellow. Doctors told her that the newborn would never walk, speak or feed herself. She survived her first day thanks only to a blood transfusion from a friend of a friend, a woman named Rosa Maria, for whom the baby was named.

Her parents struggled to pay for her cerebral palsy treatments on Ms. de la Cruz’s partner’s earnings as a construction worker. Rosa Maria’s brain tests alone cost 300 pesos each, and she had them three times a day, at a time when the minimum professional wage was about 60 pesos a day.

The city they could see just on the other side of the Rio Grande began to tempt them. They knew crossing was illegal, Ms. de la Cruz said, but their only thought was for their daughter.

“In Mexico, we weren’t going to be able to pull her through,” she said. “But my partner said, ‘Maybe in the U.S., they’ll help us with her.’ ”

Everything changed in Texas. A community center helped arrange for Rosa Maria to receive treatment through a government program for children with certain chronic, debilitating conditions that require specialized care. A month after they arrived, she had already begun receiving speech therapy, and would later receive occupational and physical therapy.

She can now speak and move. Developmentally, however, she remains closer to a 4- or 5-year-old than a 10-year-old, the family’s lawyer, Leticia Gonzalez, said.

“I don’t know how you can deny children the opportunity to thrive,” said Priscila Martinez, an immigration activist helping the family. “These families, all they’re looking for is a better opportunity for their children.”

Though she crossed an international border to reach Laredo, Ms. de la Cruz has not left the Laredo area in the decade since, because of Border Patrol checkpoints to the north. Her partner, a day laborer, was arrested and detained by immigration agents five years ago, but was allowed to stay in the country under supervision, Ms. de la Cruz said.

A few weeks ago, severe stomach pain sent Rosa Maria to the hospital, where doctors discovered kidney stones. The complications meant that she required emergency gallbladder surgery.

With her parents unable to pass through the checkpoint, they asked Rosa Maria’s adult cousin, an American citizen, to ride with her to Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Corpus Christi.

They never thought the Border Patrol would stop the ambulance.

Doctors in the Rio Grande Valley send children in need of specialized care north to Driscoll every day, often accompanied by a relative with legal status instead of their undocumented parents, said Dr. Carmen Rocco, a Brownsville pediatrician who works with immigrant families.

When Dr. Rocco first started practicing in the area three decades ago, she said, a doctor’s note was enough for Border Patrol agents to grant families temporary permission to travel to Corpus Christi for treatment. But in recent years, she said, doctors had come to expect no flexibility from the agency, forcing them to piece together teams of specialists from around the Valley to treat children south of the checkpoints. Since Mr. Trump took office, families have become even less likely to risk the journey. Rosa Maria’s case would probably discourage parents even more, Dr. Rocco said.

In May, after a hospital in Harlingen, Tex., told the Border Patrol that a gravely ill 2-month-old patient, an American citizen, needed urgent care north of the checkpoint in Corpus Christi, agents showed up and offered to escort him and his undocumented parents through the checkpoint to the hospital — as long as they agreed to be placed in deportation proceedings when they arrived.

No longer able to avoid the agents, the parents, Irma and Oscar Sanchez, said yes. As their son awaited the operation, they were taken one at a time to an immigration office for processing, and returned to the hospital, where agents kept them within sight at all times, said their lawyer, Lisa Koop. They are not in detention but are awaiting deportation hearings.

A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes the Border Patrol, said that while agency policy generally forbade making immigration arrests at hospitals, schools, churches and other so-called sensitive locations, agents had not violated the policy in either case.

They had first stopped Rosa Maria at a checkpoint before following her to the hospital, the spokesman said, while the Sanchezes were taken into custody only because of the agreement among the medical team, the parents and the Border Patrol that the infant would be allowed through the checkpoint.

When Rosa Maria’s ambulance was stopped, her cousin acknowledged to the Border Patrol that the girl was undocumented. The agents who followed the ambulance were legally obligated to do so because she was traveling without a parent or a legal guardian, raising concerns about human trafficking, the spokesman said.

Rosa Maria will be released to her family after being processed and placed in deportation proceedings, which could take weeks, her lawyer said.

ITT Technical Institute in Florida gave students the impression they’d be having careers along the line of “C.S.I.: Miami.” Actually, they frequently wound up working as security guards, degree in hand and $50,000 in debt.

There are so many awful for-profit school stories. There was that one in New York that sold students a $35,000 “Gold Elite Package” and had to change its name to “Entrepreneur Initiative” after the state determined it had no right to call itself a university. …

“The outcomes for people who take out loans at for-profits are abysmal,” said Ben Miller of the Center for American Progress. He added that almost all the students borrow, for courses they could sometimes get for one sixth the price at a community college. And about half the people who borrow default.

As the stories about deceitful for-profits mounted, the Obama administration came up with regulations making it easier for students to refuse to pay their loans if a school had misrepresented their chances of graduating and getting a lucrative career. The rules were supposed to go into effect in July, but DeVos has delayed their implementation.

Insiders call those regulations “borrower defense to repayment.” However, if you prefer, you could also refer to them as “something that reminds us of a certain school that used to promise its students fabulous careers in the real estate industry. …”

Cynics might wonder if DeVos has been going to the defense of for-profit colleges so quickly because she wants to please her boss.

But let’s be positive. Perhaps we could be grateful that DeVos is giving us opportunities to bring up Trump University on a regular basis. As a sort of cautionary tale.

For instance, the Department of Education has stopped approving new fraud claims against for-profits, leaving a backlog of more than 87,000. Every time the number goes up, we could say, “This is even more than the number of students who complained about their loans for Trump University.”

If DeVos says what the country needs now is less regulation, we can recall that Trump University had instructors allegedly handpicked by Donald Trump himself, although it turned out that he’d never even met them.

Progressive intelligentsia “is moralist against one half of the world, but accords to the revolutionary movement an indulgence that is realist in the extreme,” the French scholar Raymond Aron wrote in “The Opium of the Intellectuals” in 1955. “How many intellectuals have come to the revolutionary party via the path of moral indignation, only to connive ultimately at terror and autocracy?”

On Thursday, I noted that intellectuals have a long history of making fools of themselves with their political commitments, and that the phenomenon is fully bipartisan.

But the consequences of the left’s fellow-traveling and excuse-making are more dangerous. Venezuela is today in the throes of socialist dictatorship and humanitarian ruin, having been cheered along its predictable and unmerry course by the usual progressive suspects.

One of those suspects, Jeremy Corbyn, may be Britain’s next prime minister, in part because a generation of Britons has come of age not knowing that the line running from “progressive social commitments” to catastrophic economic results is short and straight.

Bernie Sanders captured the heart, if not yet the brain, of the Democratic Party last year by portraying “democratic socialism” as nothing more than an extension of New Deal liberalism. But the Vermont senator also insists that “the business model of Wall Street is fraud.” Efforts to criminalize capitalism and financial services also have predictable results.

It’s a bitter fact that the most astonishing strategic victory by the West in the last century turns out to be the one whose lessons we’ve never seriously bothered to teach, much less to learn. An ideology that at one point enslaved and immiserated roughly a third of the world collapsed without a fight and was exposed for all to see. Yet we still have trouble condemning it as we do equivalent evils. And we treat its sympathizers as romantics and idealists, rather than as the fools, fanatics or cynics they really were and are.
