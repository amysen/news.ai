Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

He accused Iran of “not living up to the spirit” of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.

He singled out Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.

“We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said.

Trump’s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran’s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies.

The move by Trump was part of his “America First” approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran.

Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.

“The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,” he said. “Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.”

European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.

The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world’s “most robust nuclear verification regime.”

“The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,” Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name.

U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump’s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said: “At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.”

CONGRESS DECIDES

While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include “trigger points” that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions.

Slideshow (10 Images)

The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran’s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal’s “sunset clauses” under which some of the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program expire over time.

Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs.

The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as “the worst deal ever.” It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama.

Trump warned that if “we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.”

“We’ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,” he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now.

The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department.

The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran’s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran’s domestic and foreign policies.

It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday’s measure is likely to be symbolic.

The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump’s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces.

But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump’s announcement with any provocative acts so far.",Trump strikes blow at Iran nuclear deal in major U.S. policy shift,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/trump-strikes-blow-at-iran-nuclear-deal-in-major-u-s-policy-shift-idUSKBN1CI24I?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.
“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up.
“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

PARIS (Reuters) - La politique menée par Emmanuel Macron est “à droite”, et elle est susceptible de donner un sentiment d‘injustice, déclare l‘ancien Premier ministre socialiste Bernard Cazeneuve dans un entretien au Monde publié samedi.

Depuis son départ de Matignon, l‘ex-député-maire de Cherbourg (Manche) a repris son métier d‘avocat, sans pour autant se désintéresser de la vie politique, qu‘il commente dans le quotidien.

A la question de savoir où se situe l‘action menée par Emmanuel Macron sur l‘échiquier politique, Bernard Cazeneuve répond : “Elle n‘est pas à gauche, c‘est certain. Elle est même à droite, je le regrette, car je sais aussi que si le sentiment de l‘injustice gagne, les réformes seront compromises”.

“Or le pays a besoin de réformes et ce risque ne peut pas être pris, sauf à accroître les tensions au sein de la société et à nourrir l‘extrémisme. Face à ces enjeux, la démocratie sociale doit gagner en force, et la gauche en crédibilité”, ajoute Bernard Cazeneuve, un proche de l‘ancien président François Hollande.

“Dans le même temps, la contribution sociale généralisée (CSG), notamment celle des retraités, augmente et les contrats aidés qui ont une utilité sociale sont sérieusement rabotés”, note-t-il.

Alors qu‘Emmanuel Macron entend mener une politique “ni de droite ni de gauche”, Bernard Cazeneuve dit continuer à croire au clivage entre ces deux camps, malmenés depuis les élections du printemps.

“Le clivage droite-gauche, dont la disparition est le ferment de ce prétendu ‘nouveau monde’, perdurera”, affirme-t-il. “Je redoute qu‘avec le temps, la revendication du dépassement de ce clivage, ne dissimule en réalité une propension à être tout simplement de droite.”

Il invite “la gauche de gouvernement à se reconstruire” et lance une pique à la France insoumise de Jean-Luc Mélenchon, qui se pose en opposante numéro un à l‘exécutif.

“Jean-Luc Mélenchon, par exemple, abaisse, à force d‘excès et d‘insultes, la parole politique”, juge-t-il.

Ancien ministre du Budget, Bernard Cazeneuve explique qu‘il n‘aurait “pas pu voter” le projet de loi de finances 2018 actuellement en discussion en commission à l‘Assemblée nationale. Il déplore notamment la suppression de l‘Impôt de solidarité sur la fortune (ISF), remplacé par une taxe sur les biens immobiliers.

“Dans le même temps où le gouvernement explique qu‘il n‘a pas de marges de manoeuvre, il trouve le moyen de faire plus de cinq milliards d‘euros de baisses d‘impôt au profit des plus riches des Français, en supprimant quasiment l‘impôt de solidarité sur la fortune et en allégeant la fiscalité sur les revenus du capital !”, dit Bernard Cazeneuve.","Pour Cazeneuve, Macron mène une politique ""à droite""",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CJ0CW-OFRTP

As Trump announced that he had chosen not to certify Tehran is complying with the deal but would not immediately withdraw from it, Republican Senators Bob Corker and Tom Cotton offered an outline of legislation they said would “address flaws” in the accord.

If passed, the measure would set stricter restrictions on Iran and immediately revive U.S. sanctions imposed over Iran’s nuclear program if Tehran is deemed able to produce a nuclear weapon within a year.

“We have provided a route to overcome deficiencies (in the agreement) and to keep the administration in the deal, and actually make it the kind of deal that it should have been in the first place,” Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on a call with journalists.

Republicans control Congress, but their four-seat edge in the Senate means any measure would need Democratic support to pass, even if every member of Trump’s party supports it.

That is not a given.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he had “serious doubts” about the Corker-Cotton plan. He said he would reserve judgment until the final measure, but preferred that Trump abandon the deal.

“Ultimately, leaving the nuclear deal, reimposing suspended sanctions, and having the president impose additional sanctions would serve our national interest better than a decertified deal that leaves sanctions suspended or a new law that leaves major flaws in that agreement in place,” Rubio said in a statement.

Most Democrats were strongly opposed.

Senator Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, said he would only support a measure backed by European allies who had signed the nuclear pact, formally known as the JCPOA.

“Anything we do must be consistent with the JCPOA, cannot lead us on a path to violate the JCPOA and must have the support of our European allies,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Cardin said he wanted a full-Senate briefing on the plan from administration officials, and then committee hearings.

Corker acknowledged the tough fight ahead, but said he hoped to win over Democrats.

JAMESTOWN, St. Helena (Reuters) - One of humanity’s most isolated outposts joined the 21st century on Saturday when the British island of St. Helena, home to “the world’s most useless airport”, welcomed its first commercial flight.

As the inaugural plane from Johannesburg touched down on the forbidding volcanic outcrop in the middle of the south Atlantic, the travel and history buffs on board clapped and cheered.

“I’ve never felt so emotional in all my life,” said Libby Weir-Breen, a British travel operator who has been bringing tourists to the island, 1,200 miles (1,900 km) west of the African nation of Angola, for the last 12 years.

She had flown in specially from Scotland to be on the plane, and dabbed away tears as it touched down on the spectacular cliff-side runway. “I never thought I’d see this day,” she said.

The 4,500 people living on St. Helena, a British colony since 1658 - most famous as the windswept outpost where French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte breathed his last - might also be forgiven for thinking the day would never come.

There has been talk of building an airport on St. Helena since the 1930s. The best site – one of the few flat spaces on the notoriously craggy island – was ruled out because of a nearby breeding ground for the wirebird, an endangered species of plover.

An airport at the new site, on top of a valley filled in with 8 million cubic meters of rock, suffered numerous setbacks and delays as costs ballooned to 285 million pounds, to the horror of the British government.

The runway and terminal were completed in 2016 but the official opening was pushed back another year after test flights were buffeted by wicked cross-winds, making it unsafe for large aircraft to use.

With Britain mired in financial austerity, the London media were quick to condemn it as a white elephant, or “the world’s most useless airport”, with a price tag of more than 60,000 pounds for every Saint, as the island’s residents are known.

PRICELESS

Before the opening of the airport, which will receive weekly flights to and from the South African commercial capital, the only way to St. Helena was a five-night voyage from Cape Town aboard the RMS St. Helena, a British postal ship.

With the risk of wind-shear limiting the size of planes and numbers of passengers – Saturday’s flight had room for 100 but only 68 on board due to weight restrictions – the hoped-for tourist boom is unlikely to materialize.

Hotel capacity has jumped in the last few years from just a few dozen rooms to more than 100, but, with a maximum of 3,500 visitors a year, the island is unlikely to be weaned off the 53 million pounds it receives in aid every year from London.

Besides Napoleon’s old house, Longwood, and a cemetery holding some of the 6,000 Afrikaner prisoners sent there by the British during the Anglo-Boer wars in South Africa, St. Helena offers scuba diving and walking in pristine natural wildernesses.

Governor Lisa Phillips dismissed the critics and said that even before it accepted its first commercial flight, the airport had proved its worth in the last 18 months by enabling several life-saving emergency medical evacuations, including a newborn child.

“I’ve seen the headlines about the world’s most useless airport, but for St. Helenans this has already been the most useful airport,” she told reporters after greeting them on the tarmac. “It’s priceless.”",Tears and joy on Britain’s St. Helena as 'world's most useless airport' finally opens,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CK09H-OZATP

Carlos Correa delivered a walk-off double against Aroldis Chapman, salvaging a superb effort by Justin Verlander and giving Houston the win over visiting New York in Game Two of the American League Championship Series.

The Astros will take a 2-0 series lead to New York for Game Three at Yankee Stadium on Monday.

With Jose Altuve on first base following a one-out single, Correa lined a 3-2 fastball from Chapman (0-1) into the right-center field gap. Altuve rounded the bases and scored when Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge made his relay toss toward the middle of the infield. The subsequent throw home short-hopped catcher Gary Sanchez, allowing Altuve to score.

Altuve and Correa both recorded two hits, with Correa scoring once and driving in two runs.

Verlander (1-0) delivered a sparkling performance, working nine innings while allowing one run on five hits and one walk with 13 strikeouts. He threw 124 pitches, 93 for strikes, holding off the Yankees for as long as he could to give his offense a chance to rally.

Unusual plays helped net the first run for both teams, with the Astros striking first off New York right-hander Luis Severino with one out in the fourth inning.

Correa turned around a 99 mph fastball from Severino for an opposite-field home run to right field, just sneaking the ball over the outstretched glove of Judge. A young fan in the first row of the outfield seats deflected the ball into the stands, leading to a review of the play to determine if fan interference aided the Correa home run.

The call was upheld and the Astros secured a 1-0 lead, an advantage that was short-lived.

With two outs in the fifth, after striking out Greg Bird and Starlin Castro to open the inning, Verlander surrendered consecutive doubles to Aaron Hicks and Todd Frazier, the second which lodged between the padding and chain-linked fence fronting the visiting bullpen in left-center field.

Hicks scored on the Frazier ground-rule double but Verlander rallied to induce a Chase Headley fly ball to center to preserve the tie.

Chris Taylor hit a go-ahead home run Saturday night and Charlie Culberson added an RBI and a run scored as the Los Angeles Dodgers opened the National League Championship Series with a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs.

Kenley Jansen came on to get the final four outs for the save as the Dodgers used five relievers in support of starter Clayton Kershaw, who lasted five innings.

Kershaw gave up a two-run homer to Albert Almora Jr. in the fourth inning but nothing else despite some hard-hit balls by the Cubs. The left-hander gave up four hits with four strikeouts.

Culberson’s sacrifice fly in the fifth inning tied the score 2-2. He then followed a Yasiel Puig home run in the seventh inning with a double to left. He sprinted home on a Justin Turner single but appeared to get thrown out at home when catcher Willson Contreras applied the tag in time.

But on a replay challenge, Culberson was called safe.

Cubs manager Joe Maddon was ejected for arguing the replay reversal.

Cubs starter Jose Quintana, who had experienced an emotional few days, might have needed 22 pitches in a perfect first inning but was locked in early. Through four innings, Quintana had given up just one hit but had faced the minimum thanks to a double-play grounder from Austin Barnes.

The Cubs revealed the reason their family charter flight to Los Angeles was diverted to Albuquerque, N.M., early Friday morning was because of a medical condition with Quintana’s wife.

The flight continued after a five-hour delay and Maddon waited to officially name Quintana his Game 1 starter.

Quintana did not start showing cracks until the fifth inning when he issued back-to-back walks to Logan Forsythe and Austin Barnes. Puig followed with an RBI single to cut the early Cubs lead to 2-1.

One batter later, Culberson tied the score with a sacrifice fly to left field that brought home Barnes.

Kershaw was nowhere near as efficient as Quintana in the early going. He had a runner on base in three of the first four innings, running into trouble in the fourth when he gave up a line-drive single to Contreras and a two-run homer to Almora.

Kershaw gave up two runs and four hits with a walk and four strikeouts.",Highlights of Saturday's MLB playoff games,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CK044-OCASP

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Politicians from North and South Korea will not hold direct talks in Russia on Monday about Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program despite attending the same event, Russian news agencies said on Sunday.

Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Senate upper house of parliament, is due to discuss the issue in separate talks with a deputy head of North Korea’s legislature and the head of South Korea’s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg on Monday, TASS quoted a senior Russian lawmaker as saying on Saturday.

TASS cited a Russian parliamentarian at the time as saying Moscow would call on the two countries to use the opportunity to have direct talks to try to narrow their differences.

But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Korea’s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks.

The unnamed North Korean delegate was quoted as saying that U.S. pressure on Pyongyang and U.S. and South Korean military exercises meant preconditions for such talks had not been met.

(Reuters) - Luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fired about 400 employees this week, including associates, team leaders and supervisors, a former employee told Reuters on Friday.

The dismissals were a result of a company-wide annual review, Tesla said in an emailed statement, without confirming the number of employees leaving the company.

“It’s about 400 people ranging from associates to team leaders to supervisors. We don’t know how high up it went,” said the former employee, who worked on the assembly line and did not want to be identified.

Though Tesla cited performance as the reason for the firings, the source told Reuters he was fired in spite of never having been given a bad review.

The Palo Alto, California-based company said earlier in the month that “production bottlenecks” had left Tesla behind its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan.

The company delivered 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 during the third quarter. In July, it began production of the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 - half the starting price of the Model S.

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

Any close races might not be settled until Monday, however, given the large number of postal ballots, which were taken out by roughly one in seven registered voters.

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

The Fed has two more scheduled meetings this year, in November and December.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) - Negotiators from Canada and Mexico grappled with U.S. demands to drastically alter the North American Free Trade Agreement on Saturday, as talks over renewal of the pact vilified by President Donald Trump ran through a fourth straight day.

Some downcast participants said the demands, unveiled this week in line with Trump’s “America First” agenda, have increased the odds of NAFTA’s demise. At the very least, they could make it impossible to reach a deal renewing the treaty before a year-end deadline.

“The atmosphere is complicated,” one trade official told reporters, adding that his fears about some “pretty harsh, pretty horrible” demands from the U.S. side of the negotiating table were coming true.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential, the official added the U.S. stance “has a clear protectionist bias, a bias that is trying to eradicate, minimize, eliminate the mechanisms that existed in NAFTA in the last 20 years.”

Trump, who blamed NAFTA for shifting U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico during his election campaign last year, has repeatedly vowed to scrap the treaty unless it can be renegotiated on more favorable terms.

At the mid-point of seven scheduled negotiating rounds, many of the U.S. proposals appear aimed at turning back the clock on changes in the global economy since NAFTA took effect 23 years ago. Collapse of the deal could reverberate well beyond North America, where trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico has more than quadrupled since 1994.

Former Mexican Trade Minister Jaime Serra, who was responsible for negotiating the original trade pact, said there was no economic logic to the U.S. demands.

“Issues are being put on the table that are practically absurd,” he told Reuters. “I don’t know if these are poison pills, or whether it’s a negotiating position or whether they really believe they’re putting forward sensible things.”

Some officials from NAFTA governments said they knew all along the negotiations would be tough, but vowed to soldier on through the three remaining scheduled rounds of talks.

“We said from the beginning that this was never going to be easy,” Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told CBC radio. “We want to be at the table, be constructive, offering alternative proposals.”

One of the U.S. proposals unveiled this week would require that 50 percent of the value of all NAFTA-produced cars, trucks and large engines come from the United States, people briefed on the negotiations said.

The same proposal calls for a sharp increase in NAFTA’s regional automotive content requirement, boosting it to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. The existing level is already the highest local content requirement of any trading bloc in the world. [L2N1MO0U5]

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s call for a so-called NAFTA sunset clause would effectively trigger a renegotiation of the pact every five years.

Serra said the U.S. content requirements would distort NAFTA trade with “pure protectionism” while the sunset clause would choke off investment decisions with uncertainty.

U.S. negotiators also want to end a trade dispute settlement system that has deterred U.S. anti-dumping cases while erecting new protective barriers for seasonal fruit and vegetable growers. And though Canada and Mexico had sought more access to U.S. government procurement contracts, they were met this week with a proposal that would effectively grant them less.

Even before the current round of negotiations got underway in a suburban Washington hotel, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said NAFTA was “lopsided” in favor of Mexico and Canada and needed major changes to rebalance it.

“The president has vowed to bring jobs and investment back to the United States,” Lighthizer said. “We will do no less.”

One of Lighthizer’s predecessors, Robert Zoellick, said he thought there was a 50-50 chance Trump would quit NAFTA.

“He’s trying to go back to make trade agreements fix the bilateral trade deficit. I don’t believe he can be successful in doing that,” Zoellick, now non-executive chairman of AllianceBernstein, told a banking conference in Washington on Saturday.",Grim reality of NAFTA talks sets in after tough U.S. demands,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta/grim-reality-of-nafta-talks-sets-in-after-tough-u-s-demands-idUSKBN1CJ0TH

LONDON (Reuters) - Former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cautioned Britain on Sunday over its push to secure a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump after it leaves the European Union.

Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate who lost out to Trump in last November’s election, also said Britain would face serious disruption if it left the EU without a negotiated deal with Brussels.

The British government has talked up the prospect of bilateral trade deals with the United States and others as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU following last year’s surprise referendum vote to leave.

Asked about the prospects of a British-U.S. deal, Clinton told the BBC: “You’re making a trade deal with somebody who says he doesn’t believe in trade, so I‘m not quite sure how that’s going to play out over the next few years.”

But May has since intervened in a dispute between U.S. aerospace firm Boeing and Canadian planemaker Bombardier, lobbying in the interests of Bombardier to try to protect jobs at its factory in Northern Ireland.

Clinton also said Britain would be at a “very big disadvantage” if divorce negotiations with the EU failed, and went on to compare the factors behind the Brexit vote to her own election loss.

“Looking at the Brexit vote now it was a precursor to some extent to what happened to us in the United States... The amount of fabricated, false information that your voters were given by the ‘Leave’ campaign,” she said.

She said her own presidential campaign was subject to similar treatment, citing the spread of false stories by online news outlets, and warned that Britain and other countries must be alert to the risks of such new media.

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idINKBN1CK05Z

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Ain Issa/Beirut (Reuters) - Die einstige IS-Hochburg Rakka steht nach Angaben der syrischen Kurden-Miliz unmittelbar vor der vollständigen Eroberung.

Am Sonntag habe die von den USA unterstützte Milizenallianz Syrische Demokratische Kräfte (SDF) den entscheidenden Angriff gestartet, um die letzten IS-Kämpfer aus der Stadt zu vertreiben. Ein Teil der islamistischen Extremisten habe bereits einem Abzug aus Rakka zugestimmt. Sie seien in der Nacht in einem Bus-Konvoi aus der Stadt gebracht worden. Die abgezogenen IS-Kämpfer hätten Zivilisten als menschliche Schutzschilder mit sich genommen, sagte ein Sprecher der Allianz kurdischer und arabischer Milizen der Agentur Reuters. Ausländische IS-Kämpfer hätten sich aber geweigert, dem Rückzugsabkommen zuzustimmen.

Zunächst blieb unklar, wie viele IS-Kämpfer tatsächlich die Stadt bereits verlassen haben. Vor dem Abzug des Konvois ging die Koalition von 300 bis 400 verbliebenen IS-Extremisten in Rakka aus. “Der Kampf wird solange geführt, bis die ganze Stadt von Terroristen gesäubert ist, die eine Kapitulation abgelehnt haben”, teilten die SDF mit. “Wir rechnen dort immer noch mit schweren Kämpfen”, betonte Colonel Ryan Dillon, Sprecher der US-geführten Anti-IS-Koalition. Rakka war die faktische Hauptstadt des vom IS ausgerufenen Kalifats. Nach der Befreiung der irakischen Stadt Mossul gilt die endgültige Vertreibung der Extremisten aus Rakka als Meilenstein im Kampf gegen die Islamisten.

ZIVILISTEN ALS SCHUTZSCHILDE

Ein Vertreter des von den SDF eingesetzten Zivilrats der Stadt sprach am Samstag von rund 400 Zivilisten, die den Konvoi begleiten sollten. Die Dschihadisten hätten sich geweigert, die Menschen wie verabredet nach dem Verlassen der Stadt freizulassen, sagte ein SDF-Sprecher. Die IS-Kämpfer sollten in eines der letzten den Extremisten verbliebenen Gebiete im Südosten Syriens gebracht werden. Bereits in der Vergangenheit waren kurz vor der endgültigen Rückeroberung von IS-Gebieten Kämpfer zusammen mit Gruppen von Zivilisten weggebracht worden. Häufig befanden sich darunter Angehörige der IS-Kämpfer.

Unterdessen gerät der sogenannte Islamische Staat auch in weiteren der verbliebenen Rückzugsorte stärker unter Druck. So haben syrische Regierungstruppen mit Unterstützung der russischen Luftwaffe Militärangaben zufolge die Extremisten im Osten des Landes weiter zurückgedrängt. Nahe der Grenze zum Irak sei die Stadt Al-Majadin von IS-Kämpfern zurückerobert worden, hieß es am Wochenende. Die Stadt in der Provinz Deir al-Sor war zuletzt ein wichtiger Stützpunkt des IS.

Zugleich weitete die türkische Armee im Nordwesten Syriens ihren Einsatz aus, wie Rebellen und Augenzeugen am Sonntag berichteten. Mittlerweile seien fast 200 Soldaten dort stationiert, sagte ein Militärberater der oppositionellen Freien Syrischen Armee (FSA). Auch würden weitere Beobachterposten in der nordsyrischen Provinz Idlib errichtet. Die Türkei will in Absprache mit dem Iran und Russland dort Deeskalationszonen schaffen.[nL8N1MO1QI] Den Rebellen zufolge nutzt die Türkei den Einsatz aber auch, um die kurdische YPG-Miliz in Schach zu halten.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

The militants controlled Mogadishu between 2007 and 2011 but withdrew as fighting raged. African Union peacekeepers also drove them out of most other territory they controlled.",Death toll from blasts in Somalia's capital Mogadishu rises to 85,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-attacks/death-toll-from-blasts-in-somalias-capital-mogadishu-rises-to-85-idUSKBN1CK08E

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

Equifax, which disclosed last month that cyber criminals breached its systems between mid-May and late July and made off with sensitive data on 145.5 million people, said on Thursday it shut down one of its website pages after discovering that a third-party vendor was running malicious code on the page.

“The IRS notified us that they have issued a stop-work order under our Transaction Support for Identity Management contract,” an Equifax spokesperson said on Friday.

“We remain confident that we are the best party to perform the services required in this contract,” the spokesperson said. “We are engaging IRS officials to review the facts and clarify available options.”

The IRS is the first organization to say publicly that it is suspending a contract with Equifax since the credit reporting agency’s security problems came to light.

Atlanta-based Equifax said its systems were not compromised by the incident on Thursday, which involved bogus pop-up windows on the web page that could trick visitors into installing software that automatically displays advertising material.

Still, the IRS said it decided to temporarily suspended its short-term contract with Equifax for identity-proofing services.

“During this suspension, the IRS will continue its review of Equifax systems and security,” the agency said in a statement. There was no indication that any of the IRS data shared with Equifax under the contract had been compromised, it added.

The move means that the IRS will temporarily be unable to create new accounts for taxpayers using its Secure Access portal, which supports applications including online accounts and transcripts. Users who already had Secure Access accounts will not be affected, the IRS said.

IRS granted the $7.25 million contract to Equifax on Sept. 29, weeks after Equifax disclosed the massive data hack that drew scathing criticism from several lawmakers.

“From its initial announcement, the timing and nature of this IRS-Equifax contract raised some serious red flags ... we are pleased to see the IRS suspend its contract with Equifax,” Republican Representatives Greg Walden and Robert Latta said in a joint statement on Friday.

“Our focus now remains on protecting consumers and getting answers for the 145 million Americans impacted by this massive breach,” they said.

Government contracts in areas such as healthcare, law enforcement, social services, and tax and revenue, are major sources of revenue for Equifax.

In 2016, government services made up 5 percent of Equifax’s overall $3.1 billion in revenue, accounting for 10 percent of its workforce solutions revenues, 3 percent of its U.S. information solutions revenues, and 7 percent of its international revenues, according to a regulatory financial filing.",IRS puts Equifax contract on hold during security review,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber/irs-puts-equifax-contract-on-hold-during-security-review-idUSKBN1CI2G9

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

Any close races might not be settled until Monday, however, given the large number of postal ballots, which were taken out by roughly one in seven registered voters. The bulk of those ballots will not be counted until Monday.",Europe's migration crisis casts long shadow as Austria votes,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CJ0T8-OCATP

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations centre for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important centre, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverised by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idINKBN1CK05Z

It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.","Russia’s latest “Zapad” military exercise is underway on NATO’S eastern border. Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

Equifax, which disclosed last month that cyber criminals breached its systems between mid-May and late July and made off with sensitive data on 145.5 million people, said on Thursday it shut down one of its website pages after discovering that a third-party vendor was running malicious code on the page.

“The IRS notified us that they have issued a stop-work order under our Transaction Support for Identity Management contract,” an Equifax spokesperson said on Friday.

“We remain confident that we are the best party to perform the services required in this contract,” the spokesperson said. “We are engaging IRS officials to review the facts and clarify available options.”

The IRS is the first organization to say publicly that it is suspending a contract with Equifax since the credit reporting agency’s security problems came to light.

Atlanta-based Equifax said its systems were not compromised by the incident on Thursday, which involved bogus pop-up windows on the web page that could trick visitors into installing software that automatically displays advertising material.

Still, the IRS said it decided to temporarily suspended its short-term contract with Equifax for identity-proofing services.

“During this suspension, the IRS will continue its review of Equifax systems and security,” the agency said in a statement. There was no indication that any of the IRS data shared with Equifax under the contract had been compromised, it added.

The move means that the IRS will temporarily be unable to create new accounts for taxpayers using its Secure Access portal, which supports applications including online accounts and transcripts. Users who already had Secure Access accounts will not be affected, the IRS said.

“From its initial announcement, the timing and nature of this IRS-Equifax contract raised some serious red flags ... we are pleased to see the IRS suspend its contract with Equifax,” Republican Representatives Greg Walden and Robert Latta said in a joint statement on Friday.

“Our focus now remains on protecting consumers and getting answers for the 145 million Americans impacted by this massive breach,” they said.

Government contracts in areas such as healthcare, law enforcement, social services, and tax and revenue, are major sources of revenue for Equifax.

In 2016, government services made up 5 percent of Equifax’s overall $3.1 billion in revenue, accounting for 10 percent of its workforce solutions revenues, 3 percent of its U.S. information solutions revenues, and 7 percent of its international revenues, according to a regulatory financial filing.",IRS puts Equifax contract on hold during security review,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber/irs-puts-equifax-contract-on-hold-during-security-review-idUKKBN1CI2G9

LONDON (Reuters) - Parliament will block Britain from leaving the European Union without an exit deal, the opposition Labour Party’s finance policy chief said on Sunday.

Negotiations are deadlocked between Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and the EU on securing a divorce settlement and agreement on future relations, raising the prospect that Britain could walk away from talks without a deal.

But Labour’s John McDonnell, leader Jeremy Corbyn’s most senior ally, said he believed there was enough support in parliament to block such an eventuality.

“I don’t think it’s a realistic option, it’s not going to happen. I don’t think there is a majority in parliament for no deal,” McDonnell told the BBC.

Currently, parliament does not have the power to block any decision to walk away. The government has promised to give parliament a vote on whether to accept a negotiated final deal, but that does not provide a means to block ‘no deal’.

However, McDonnell said he thought there was enough support in parliament - where May does not have an outright majority - to amend legislation to include such a right.

“They haven’t got a majority to get through a no deal situation in parliament. (If) we amend the legislation for parliament to have a meaningful vote, that will force the government to negotiate and come to their senses,” he said.","UK parliament will block 'no deal' Brexit, opposition party says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-nodeal/uk-parliament-will-block-no-deal-brexit-opposition-party-says-idUKKBN1CK0BU

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Politicians from North and South Korea will not hold direct talks in Russia on Monday about Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program despite attending the same event, Russian news agencies said on Sunday.

Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Senate upper house of parliament, is due to discuss the issue in separate talks with a deputy head of North Korea’s legislature and the head of South Korea’s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg on Monday, TASS quoted a senior Russian lawmaker as saying on Saturday.

TASS cited a Russian parliamentarian at the time as saying Moscow would call on the two countries to use the opportunity to have direct talks to try to narrow their differences.

But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Korea’s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks.

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Slideshow (9 Images)

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

Any close races might not be settled until Monday, however, given the large number of postal ballots, which were taken out by roughly one in seven registered voters.

JAMESTOWN, St. Helena (Reuters) - One of humanity’s most isolated outposts joined the 21st century on Saturday when the British island of St. Helena, home to “the world’s most useless airport”, welcomed its first commercial flight.

As the inaugural plane from Johannesburg touched down on the forbidding volcanic outcrop in the middle of the south Atlantic, the travel and history buffs on board clapped and cheered.

“I’ve never felt so emotional in all my life,” said Libby Weir-Breen, a British travel operator who has been bringing tourists to the island, 1,200 miles (1,900 km) west of the African nation of Angola, for the last 12 years.

She had flown in specially from Scotland to be on the plane, and dabbed away tears as it touched down on the spectacular cliff-side runway. “I never thought I’d see this day,” she said.

The 4,500 people living on St. Helena, a British colony since 1658 - most famous as the windswept outpost where French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte breathed his last - might also be forgiven for thinking the day would never come.

There has been talk of building an airport on St. Helena since the 1930s. The best site – one of the few flat spaces on the notoriously craggy island – was ruled out because of a nearby breeding ground for the wirebird, an endangered species of plover.

An airport at the new site, on top of a valley filled in with 8 million cubic metres of rock, suffered numerous setbacks and delays as costs ballooned to 285 million pounds, to the horror of the British government.

The runway and terminal were completed in 2016 but the official opening was pushed back another year after test flights were buffeted by wicked cross-winds, making it unsafe for large aircraft to use.

With Britain mired in financial austerity, the London media were quick to condemn it as a white elephant, or “the world’s most useless airport”, with a price tag of more than 60,000 pounds for every Saint, as the island’s residents are known.

PRICELESS

Before the opening of the airport, which will receive weekly flights to and from the South African commercial capital, the only way to St. Helena was a five-night voyage from Cape Town aboard the RMS St. Helena, a British postal ship.

With the risk of wind-shear limiting the size of planes and numbers of passengers – Saturday’s flight had room for 100 but only 68 on board due to weight restrictions – the hoped-for tourist boom is unlikely to materialise.

Hotel capacity has jumped in the last few years from just a few dozen rooms to more than 100, but, with a maximum of 3,500 visitors a year, the island is unlikely to be weaned off the 53 million pounds it receives in aid every year from London.

Besides Napoleon’s old house, Longwood, and a cemetery holding some of the 6,000 Afrikaner prisoners sent there by the British during the Anglo-Boer wars in South Africa, St. Helena offers scuba diving and walking in pristine natural wildernesses.

Governor Lisa Phillips dismissed the critics and said that even before it accepted its first commercial flight, the airport had proved its worth in the last 18 months by enabling several life-saving emergency medical evacuations, including a newborn child.

“I’ve seen the headlines about the world’s most useless airport, but for St. Helenans this has already been the most useful airport,” she told reporters after greeting them on the tarmac. “It’s priceless.”",Tears and joy on St. Helena as 'world's most useless airport' finally opens,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-sthelena/tears-and-joy-on-st-helena-as-worlds-most-useless-airport-finally-opens-idUKKBN1CJ0QF

Germans disgruntled with Merkel’s liberal migrant policy abandoned her party in droves in September’s national election. Having recorded the worst conservative result since 1949, she must now try to piece together an awkward alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens.

Those parties will this week begin discussions that could drag into 2018 about entering a marriage of convenience untested at the federal level.

The latest opinion poll put the SPD on 34.5 percent in the northern swing state of Lower Saxony, giving it a 1.5 point lead over Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) who had been 12 points ahead at the start of the campaign in August.

Exit polls are expected at 1600 GMT.

Simon Fink, political scientist at the University of Goettingen, said no one had dared to start coalition negotiations in Berlin ahead of the election in Lower Saxony, which is slightly bigger than the Netherlands and hosts major companies such as carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

“Everyone was scared that if they did something at the national level or committed themselves to something, then their colleagues in Lower Saxony could end up suffering,” he said.

“JAMAICA” ON THE HORIZON

Merkel’s reverse in September, along with the SPD’s insistence on going into opposition, left her with no viable option other than a “Jamaica” coalition, so named because the three parties’ colours correspond with the black, yellow and green of Jamaica’s flag.

It means the prospective partners will need to overcome yawning differences on issues ranging from immigration to European Union reform, tax and environmental protection.

Cem Ozdemir, co-leader of the Greens, said the three parties had not sought each other out but now had a responsibility to form a coalition that bore the hallmarks of their conservative, liberal and center-left identities.

“If the coalition comes off, it must not be a coalition that only agrees on the lowest common denominator. That won’t work,” he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper, adding that the trio needed a “shared narrative”.

A deal brokered last weekend between Merkel’s CDU and its conservative Bavarian sister party, the CSU, to cap the number of immigrants is likely to be hard for the Greens to swallow.

Merkel has acknowledged the difficulties ahead but added that “unusual combinations can of course bring the opportunity to find some solutions to things that had seemed unsolvable until now”.

“So now we need to put our noses to the grindstone,” she said on the campaign trail in Lower Saxony on Thursday.

An SPD-Green coalition has ruled the state for almost four years, but lost its majority when a Greens lawmaker defected to the CDU, triggering a snap election.

The SPD’s incumbent state premier, Stephan Weil, a 58-year-old former judge, fares better in the personal popularity stakes than his CDU rival Bernd Althusmann, a 50-year-old former army officer.

Althusmann had not given up hope on Saturday though, saying voters were making their decisions later and later. “It’s a question of mobilizing voters,” he said.",State vote unlikely to give Merkel boost in German coalition talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election-lower-saxony/state-vote-unlikely-to-give-merkel-boost-in-german-coalition-talks-idUSKBN1CJ0T5?il=0

Washington (Reuters) - Die Weltwirtschaft kommt wieder auf Touren - doch der Aufschwung ist kein Selbstläufer.

Die Regierungen haben noch jede Menge Arbeit vor sich. Sie sollen unter anderem dafür sorgen, dass mehr Menschen von den Wohlstandsgewinnen profitieren. Diese Botschaft verbreitete der Internationale Währungsfonds (IWF) am Wochenende zum Abschluss seiner Herbsttagung in Washington. IWF-Chefin Christine Lagarde rief dazu auf, die günstigen Konjunkturaussichten zu Strukturreformen und zum Schuldenabbau zu nutzen. “Man muss das Dach reparieren, wenn die Sonne scheint”, betonte sie.

Ein Jahrzehnt nach Ausbruch der Finanzkrise sieht der Fonds die globale Wirtschaft auf einem guten Weg. Investitionen, Handel und Produktion ziehen wieder an, wie der IWF-Lenkungsausschusses (IMFC) in seinem Abschlusskommunique konstatierte. Aber die Erholung sei “noch nicht vollständig”, warnten die Autoren. In vielen Ländern werde das Wachstumspotenzial nicht ausgeschöpft. Außerdem sei die Inflation schwach.

Thema bei den Zusammenkünften von IWF und Weltbank sowie den Finanzministern und Notenbankchefs der führenden 20 Industrie- und Schwellenländer (G20) war zudem die soziale Ungleichheit in zahlreichen Staaten. Teilnehmer forderten verstärkte Anstrengungen, um eine möglichst umfassende Teilhabe am Aufschwung zu sichern. “Unsere Wirtschaft ist immer noch so gebaut, dass sie den Kopf im Ofen und die Füße im Gefrierschrank hat”, sagte Kanadas Notenbankchef Stephen Poloz. “Bei denen, die ihre Füße im Gefrierschrank haben, kommt es nicht an, wenn man sagt, dass alles auf dem richtigen Weg sei.”

LÖHNE HINKEN HINTERHER

Vor allem aus Sicht der Notenbanken hinken Inflation und Löhne deutlich hinter der Konjunkturentwicklung zurück. Daher zögern sie derzeit, ihre in Folge der Krise extrem gelockerte Geldpolitik wieder zu straffen. In Washington mahnten führende Zentralbanker zu Geduld. Die Teuerung werde langsamer anziehen als gedacht, sagte EZB-Präsident Mario Draghi. “Es wird Zeit brauchen.” Ähnlich äußerte sich sein japanischer Amtskollege Haruhiko Kuroda, der nach eigenen Worten keine große Gefahren als Resultat der ultralaxen Geldpolitik erkennen kann. Es gebe keine Anzeichen für Übertreibungen an den Welt-Börsen. Die Rekordjagd an den Aktienmärkten spiegele die starken Firmengewinne in Japan, den USA und Europa wider, sagte Kuroda.

Das Thema Handel wurde im IWF-Kommunique zwar nicht erwähnt, spielte bei den Unterredungen aber durchaus eine Rolle. Hintergrund waren insbesondere Befürchtungen, dass die “America First”-Politik von US-Präsident Donald Trump eine neue Welle des Protektionismus lostreten könnte. Ein eindringliches Plädoyer für den Freihandel gab der scheidende Bundesfinanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble ab bei seinem voraussichtlich letzten Großauftritt auf internationaler Bühne.[nL8N1MN0FU] “Wir sollten uns alle Sorgen machen über das schwache Wachstum des Welthandels und die zunehmende Anti-Freihandels-Rhetorik”, betonte Schäuble. “Wir brauchen nicht weniger, sondern mehr Offenheit.”

STREITPUNKT BANKENREGULIERUNG

Derzeit laufen Verhandlungen über die Zukunft des nordamerikanischen Handelsabkommens (Nafta) zwischen den USA, Kanada und Mexiko. Dies hatte Trump angestoßen, der den bisherigen Vertrag als nachteilig für die Vereinigten Staaten ablehnt. IWF-Chefin Lagarde bezeichnete es als legitim, langjährige Vereinbarungen geänderten Umständen anzupassen. Zugleich äußerte sie die Hoffnung, dass es zu einer Lösung kommt, die für alle Seiten gewinnbringend ist.

Aus deutscher Sicht ebenfalls von besonderem Interesse war die Frage der Bankenregulierung. Die Verhandlungen über neue Vorgaben zur Kapitalausstattung als Konsequenz aus der Finanzkrise gestalteten sich bislang schwierig. Inzwischen zeichnet sich allerdings eine Einigung beim Reformprojekt Basel III ab. Der Streit zwischen amerikanischer und europäischer Seite dreht sich um die Frage, inwieweit die Banken bei der Berechnung des Kapitalbedarfs zur Absicherung von Risiken auf eigene Modelle zurückgreifen dürfen. Die Europäer wollen hier mehr Spielraum, die USA weniger zulassen. Der diskutierte Kompromiss stößt in der deutschen Kreditwirtschaft auf scharfe Kritik. Sie befürchtet eine klare Benachteiligung europäischer Geldhäuser, die nach ihrer Einschätzung letztlich auch die Mittelstandsfinanzierung belasten würde.",IWF - Aufschwung ist kein Selbstläufer,https://www.reuters.com/article/weltwirtschaft-iwf-idDEKBN1CK07Y

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A euro zone budget of several hundred billion euros is an ambitious idea, the head of euro zone finance ministers said on Saturday, suggesting loans from the bailout fund and transfers from the existing European Union budget could be more feasible.

“Creating a whole new budget, inside or outside the European Union budget, of many hundred billion, is courageous,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s meetings in Washington.

Euro zone governments are debating how to integrate further the 19 members of the 28-nation European Union that share the single currency to prevent a repeat of the sovereign debt crisis and reap greater benefits from the euro.

The European Central Bank and the euro zone bailout fund ESM support the idea of a separate pool of money for the euro zone that would help it respond to crises that hit only some members, rather than the whole bloc.

But among politicians the views on a need for a separate budget, its size and purpose vary greatly.

The EU as a whole already has a budget worth 1 percent of its gross national income, which finances projects ranging from agriculture to a policy of increasing cohesion between the richer and poorer members.

French President Emmanuel Macron has floated the idea of a separate euro zone budget, financed from dedicated taxes and worth several hundred billion euros.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been more in favor of a “small” budget, while a German position paper for a finance ministers’ meeting last Monday said it was not necessary at all.

Dijsselbloem, who will present ideas for euro zone reform to euro zone leaders at a summit in December, said that in discussing a euro zone budget it was important to distinguish between transfers and loans.

It was crucial that any such budget would not create mutual euro zone debt - a red line for Germany, long wary of being roped into responsibility for other countries debts.

This left policymakers with two choices, Dijsselbloem said. First, they could create what he called “convergence instruments” which would transfer money from the existing EU budget to countries implementing reforms.

The second option would be for the bailout fund ESM to offer cheap loans to countries financing reforms which also want to invest but do not have enough money for both.

CONVERGENCE INSTRUMENT AND LOANS

Dijsselbloem said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last month was first to suggest carving out the convergence instrument from the existing EU budget, while Merkel has mentioned cheap loans for reforms.

The differences between Paris and Berlin on the size of the budget might be reconciled by keeping the project owned by governments, which would give powerful Germany a large say, while accommodating French ideas on how to spend the money.

“Some of the French ideas on what additional instruments we need could be used within the German ideas on how to do it institutionally,” Dijsselbloem said, noting Berlin was keen to transform the bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund.

“If you want a European Monetary Fund you should also look at the kind of instruments that the IMF has,” he said.

“We could also look at developing new instruments in the ESM. Preventive instruments, supporting countries that are in a convergence process or a reform effort. I think that is compatible with both French and German thinking,” he said.

Dijsselbloem said that in discussing the budget, policymakers needed to first decide what policies they would like to finance at a European level.

“There is quite broad support in Europe that the EU should play a stronger role in providing border control, on migration policy and in cooperation on security and defense,” he said.

In such a case, one could also argue it requires a larger EU budget, Dijsselbloem said.

But carving out a separate euro area portion of the general EU budget, as suggested by Juncker, would be tricky, he said.

For example, it would raise the question whether there should be a euro zone sub-parliament in the European Parliament and how it would it work, he said.

However, supporting reforms with transfers from the existing EU budget, would be a good start.

“If we could use some of the existing EU funds, or possibly new funds, but even some of the existing funds in the EU budget to connect countries to the most important reforms, that would already be very helpful,” Dijsselbloem said.",Eurogroup head outlines pragmatic view on 'euro zone budget',https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-g20-eurozone-budget/interview-eurogroup-head-outlines-pragmatic-view-on-euro-zone-budget-idINKBN1CK02I

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an Iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of Kirkuk, which controls the access to some of the region’s main oilfields, a Kurdish security official told Reuters on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani arrived in Iraq’s Kurdistan region for talks about the escalating crisis between the Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government following last month’s Kurdish independence referendum.

Soleimani is the commander of foreign operations for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, a military corp providing training and weapons to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi‘ite-led government in Baghdad, known as Popular Mobilisation.

He arrived in the Kurdish region Saturday, a Kurdish official said.

Popular Mobilisation had given the Peshmerga until midnight local time (2100 GMT Saturday) to leave a position north of the Maktab Khalid junction, an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) Security Council said.

Ali al-Hussaini, a spokesman for the paramilitary groups known as Hashid Shaabi in Arabic, told Reuters the deadline had expired without giving indications about their next move.

“We are waiting for new orders, no extension is expected,” he said.

The Kurdish position north of the junction controls the access to an important airbase and Bai Hassan, one of the main crude oil fields of the region, the KRG official said.

The city, the airbase and their immediate surroundings, including the oilfields, are under Kurdish control.

There were no clashes reported 14 hours after the deadline, but a resident said dozens of young Kurds took up arms and were deployed in the streets of Kirkuk with machine guns as the news of the warning spread.

The KRG and the Shi‘ite-led central government in Baghdad are at loggerheads since the Sept. 25 vote, which delivered an overwhelming yes for Kurdish independence.

Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront Iraqi “threats.”

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the Kurds.

Popular Mobilisation is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to Abadi. It is deployed alongside the army south and west of Kirkuk.

Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk’s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

The militants controlled Mogadishu between 2007 and 2011 but withdrew as fighting raged.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Taliban spokesman denied on Sunday accusations by a Canadian man that one of his children had been murdered and his wife raped while they were being held captive by militants who kidnapped them in Afghanistan in 2012.

Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were held by the Haqqani network, a semi-independent wing of the Afghan Taliban, before being rescued by Pakistani troops in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghan border, last week.

Boyle told reporters soon after he, his wife and their three children returned to Canada on Friday that their captors had murdered a fourth child had raped his wife.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that as propaganda by the Western governments that helped rescue the family.

“We strongly reject these fake and fabricated allegations of this Canadian family, now in the hands of the enemy,” he said in a statement sent to media.‎

“Whatever statement the enemy wants to put in their mouth, the family is forced to make it.”

Boyle called on the Taliban to “provide my family with the justice we deserve”.

Mujahid said the couple was intentionally never separated in order to protect their safety.

He also denied that their child had been murdered, but acknowledged that one child became sick and died.

“We were in a remote areas without access to a doctor and medications that led the loss of the child,” he said.

Three children, all born in captivity, were rescued along with Boyle and Coleman.

The Haqqanis previously held U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed in a swap for Taliban prisoners in 2014, and are suspected of holding two professors, an American and an Australian, who were kidnapped outside their university in Kabul in 2016.

A senior Afghan government official told Reuters that American and Afghan special forces launched two unsuccessful raids to try to rescue the professors in Afghanistan, but officials now believe the pair has been taken to Haqqani hideouts over the border in Pakistan.","Afghan Taliban deny former hostage's claims of murder, rape",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-afghanistan-kidnapping/afghan-taliban-deny-former-hostages-claims-of-murder-rape-idUSKBN1CK09T

And when Trump ran for president last year, he frequently said that only he “alone” could fix the nation’s problems.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week showed Trump’s approval slipping among the rural voters he so successfully courted in last year’s election.
The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college.
He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For the moment, U.S. President Donald Trump is going it alone.

After weeks of seeing his agenda imperiled by Republican divisions and infighting among his aides, Trump has been a whirl of activity this week, reasserting his campaign priorities and trying to deliver wins for his fervent but frustrated base of supporters.

Trump took steps to dramatically undercut the Obamacare health system, sent notice he was willing to scuttle the nuclear deal with Iran, moved to roll back coal-plant limits, and again demanded a wall along the Mexican border.

And on social media the Republican president appeared to relish his feuds with the news media, senior Republicans in Congress, and National Football League players who have protested during the national anthem.

In a sense, it was the vintage, freewheeling Trump: throwing red meat to his voter base, following his gut, and haranguing his critics.

But by the end of the week, he had made more progress in undoing the policy accomplishments of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, than he had in some time.

“Trump knows he has to make good on several of his campaign promises,” said Ford O‘Connell, a Republican strategist. “The clock is ticking, Congress is useless and portions of his base are growing frustrated.”

At the same time, there is still chaos and uncertainty in the White House, so much so much so that Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, took the unusual step of telling reporters that he was not resigning. Meanwhile, the job status of his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, appears to remain tenuous.

The timing of some of Trump’s measures this week was driven by external deadlines, especially in the case of the Iran deal. And his administration has also been occupied by a spate of deadly hurricanes and the shooting spree in Las Vegas, which have hampered its ability to move forward on its policy agenda.

But Trump this week was also sending a clear message: that he plans on doing as much as he can without waiting for Congress to act.

“The president campaigned on a bold agenda, and Congress’s inaction won’t stop the administration’s tireless efforts to boost the economy, improve healthcare, and protect the American people,” said Raj Shah, the White House’s principal deputy press secretary.

When he sat in the Oval Office, Obama defiantly declared that he would circumvent a hostile Congress by using a “pen and a phone,” issuing executive orders where possible.

And when Trump ran for president last year, he frequently said that only he “alone” could fix the nation’s problems.

But once he took office, Trump attempted to follow the lead of Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he watched with dismay how little movement was made on priorities such as healthcare, immigration, and national security.

LESSONS FROM ALABAMA

Trump, too, remains bothered by another time he deferred to congressional Republicans and supported incumbent Senator Luther Strange in a divisive primary fight last month in Alabama.

Strange lost to Roy Moore, an archconservative backed by Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, with many of Trump’s core supporters voting for Moore.

The loss came after Trump alarmed some conservatives by saying he could cut deals with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to advance his agenda, particularly on providing relief from deportation for ”Dreamers” - immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

That led to speculation that he was going to chart a more centrist course.

But there was little of that talk this week after the White House released a series of hard-line immigration proposals that stand to threaten any bipartisan deal. Pelosi called the proposals “trash.”

Trump, too, rejected the advice of Kelly, Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other aides in decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, according to two administration officials, intent on staying true to his fierce criticism of the deal during the campaign.

Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide to Trump, said Strange’s loss served as a reminder to Trump that he has to look after the interests of his political base.

“That was a big punch in the stomach,” Nunberg said, one that showed the president that “this is not a cult of personality. It’s about deliverables.”

Those deliverables are the fulfillment of the campaign promises that Bannon once featured on a whiteboard in his White House office, said Nunberg, who added that Bannon’s shadow “still hovers over the West Wing.”

Bannon has pledged to support primary challengers to Republican Senate incumbents in several states next year in a bid to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he blames for impeding Trump’s policy agenda.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week showed Trump’s approval slipping among the rural voters he so successfully courted in last year’s election.

In September, 47 percent of people in rural areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved, the poll found. That was down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.","In a sudden flurry, Trump looks to deliver for his voters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-analysis/in-a-sudden-flurry-trump-looks-to-deliver-for-his-voters-idUSKBN1CI32X

One day after his administration announced plans to end the payments next week, Trump said he would dismantle Obamacare “step by step.”

His latest action raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets. The subsidies cost $7 billion this year and were estimated at $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts.

“As far as the subsidies are concerned, I don’t want to make the insurance companies rich,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They’re making a fortune by getting that kind of money.”

Trump’s action took aim at a critical element of the 2010 law, his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has taken several steps to chip away at it.

Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging the law.

Democratic attorneys general from the 18 states as well as Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit in federal court in California later on Friday. The states include: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington state.

The states will ask the court to force Trump to make the next payment. Legal experts said the states were likely to face an uphill battle in court.

“His effort to gut these subsidies with no warning or even a plan to contain the fallout is breathtakingly reckless,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. “This is an effort simply to blow up the system.”

Related Coverage Trump says Democratic leaders should come to White House to negotiate healthcare deal

The new lawsuit would be separate from a case pending before an appeals court in the District of Columbia in which 16 Democratic state attorneys general are defending the legality of the payments.

If the subsidies vanish, low-income Americans who obtain insurance through Obamacare online marketplaces where insurers can sell policies would face higher insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs. It would particularly hurt lower-middle-class families whose incomes are still too high to qualify for certain government assistance.

About 10 million people are enrolled in Obamacare through its online marketplaces, and most receive subsidies. Trump’s action came just weeks before the period starting on Nov. 1 when individuals have to begin enrolling for 2018 insurance coverage through the law’s marketplaces.

The administration will not make the next payment to insurers, scheduled for Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism about chances for a deal with Republicans to continue the subsidy payments.

“We’re going to have a very good opportunity to get this done in a bipartisan way” during negotiations in December on broad federal spending legislation, “if we can’t get it done sooner,” Schumer told reporters.

Trump offered an invitation for Democratic leaders to come to the White House, while also lashing out at them. “We’ll negotiate some deal that’s good for everybody. But they’re always a bloc vote against everything. They’re like obstructionists,” Trump told reporters.

The Senate failed in both July and September to pass legislation backed by Trump to repeal Obamacare due to opposition by a handful of Republican senators. One of them, Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who had been contemplating running for governor next year, on Friday said she planned to remain in the Senate and would use her voice in reforming the healthcare system.

SHARES OF INSURERS, HOSPITALS FALL

Hospitals, doctors, health insurers, state insurance commissioners and patient advocates decried Trump’s move, saying consumers will ultimately pay the price. They called on Congress to appropriate the funds needed to keep up the subsidy payments.

Shares of U.S. hospital companies and health insurers closed down on Friday after the subsidies announcement. Centene Corp (CNC.N) closed down 3.3 percent and Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) closed down 3.4 percent. Among hospital shares, Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) finished 5.1 percent lower and Community Health Systems (CYH.N) declined 4.0 percent.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that erasing the subsidies would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion over the next decade because the government still would be obligated under other parts of Obamacare to help lower-income people pay for insurance premiums.

Trump, who as a candidate last year promised to roll back the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, received applause for his latest action during an appearance on Friday before a group of conservative voters.

“It’s step by step by step, and that was a very big step yesterday,” Trump said. “And one by one, it’s going to come down, and we’re going to have great healthcare in our country.”

Earlier on Twitter he called Obamacare “a broken mess” that is “imploding,” and referred to the “pet insurance companies” of Democrats.

Republicans for seven years had vowed to get rid of Obamacare, but deep intra-party divisions have scuttled their efforts to get legislation through the Senate, where they hold a slim majority.

Since taking office in January, Trump threatened many times to cut the subsidies. Health insurers that planned to stay in the Obamacare market prepared for the move in many states by submitting two sets of premium rates to regulators: with and without the subsidies.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the change would drive up premium costs for consumers by at least 12 to 15 percent in 2018 and cut more than $1 billion in payments to insurers for 2017.

The White House announced the cut-off just hours after Trump signed an order intended to allow insurers to sell lower-cost, bare-bones policies with limited benefits and consumer protections.

Republicans have called Obamacare an unnecessary government intrusion into the American healthcare system. Democrats have said the law needs some fixes but noted that it had brought insurance to 20 million people.",U.S. states sue to block Trump Obamacare subsidies cut,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/u-s-states-sue-to-block-trump-obamacare-subsidies-cut-idUSKBN1CI0E4

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova won her first WTA title in more than two years at the Tianjin Open on Sunday, showing plenty of grit and determination as she came from behind in each set to beat Belarusian teenager Aryna Sabalenka 7-5 7-6(8).

The former world number one, who returned to the tour in April following a 15-month doping ban, started the stronger, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game, but struggled on serve and soon found herself trailing 4-1 in the first set.

The Russian managed to hold serve for the first time in the match at 4-2 and clung on grimly in the face of some hard hitting by her 19-year-old opponent before converting her fourth break point of the next game to get back on serve at 4-3.

Her nerves settled, Sharapova began to hit her stride, breaking Sabalenka again to go 6-5 up before closing out the set.

The Belarusian, playing her first WTA final, came back in the second set, opening up a 5-1 lead before serving to send the match into a decider, but Sharapova once again fought back to erase the deficit.

The 30-year-old broke Sabalenka twice in succession and held her nerve when facing a set point on serve at 5-4 to level things up, and broke the Belarusian to give herself the chance to serve out the match at 6-5.

But there was more drama to come. The Russian, who sent down seven aces during the contest, double faulted when facing a break point to gift Sabalenka the game and send the set into a tiebreak.

Sharapova, whose last title came at the Italian Open in May 2015, had three match points but Sabalenka survived them all before double faulting with the score at 8-8 to hand Sharapova another opportunity.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid.
The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

IndusInd will give Bharat Financial’s shareholders 639 of its shares for every 1,000 shares they own in the microfinance lender, both companies said in a joint statement.

The deal values Bharat Financial at 1118.47 rupees a share, an 11.4 percent premium to the stock’s Friday closing price of 1,004 rupees.

“The combination brings together entities with significant complementary strengths and huge synergistic advantages,” IndusInd Chief Executive Romesh Sobti said in the statement.

The deal is expected to add value from the start given IndusInd’s lower cost of funding among other factors, the companies said in the statement. They said Bharat Financial’s distribution network also offered large untapped deposit potential from rural and underserved Indian customers.

Deutsche Bank analysts have previously said the deal would help IndusInd become a dominant player in the microfinance industry and boost its earnings by 2019.

Bharat Financial, a for-profit group that focuses on lending small sums to poorer women in rural areas, has 6.8 million borrowers and “last-mile” customer access to 100,000 Indian villages. The combined group will have more than 2,600 branches.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund members gave lukewarm endorsement to a strengthening global economy but conceded they were not out of the woods as they grappled with subdued inflation, low potential growth and an uneven recovery that clouded the outlook.

With central banks left with less firepower and some seeking to exit crisis-mode stimulus measures, the IMF members also renewed calls for fiscal policy and structural reforms to carry more of the burden in solidifying the recovery, now that the worst days of the economic storm had passed.

“Structural reforms that were difficult to do in hard times would be much easier in better times because the outlook is stronger,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Saturday.

“It’s when the sun is shining that you need to fix the roof. That message was received 100 percent (by the policymakers).”

A communique from the IMF’s steering body, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), said a global economic upswing, driven by a pickup in investment, trade and factory output, was brightening the outlook.

But it warned policymakers against complacency, saying that the recovery was “not yet complete” with inflation below target and potential growth weak in many countries.

Financial leaders attending the meeting also warned that while economies had improved in many countries there were people who had been left behind.

“We’re still an economy with our head in the oven and our feet in the freezer. So for the people with their feet in the freezer, that doesn’t resonate with them if you say everything’s on track,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.

PATIENCE NEEDED

The optimism on global growth was overshadowed by tensions on trade, which was in full show in contentious talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) held during the IMF’s autumn meetings.

The communique made no mention of trade, though Lagarde sought to offer a bright note by saying it was “perfectly legitimate” to renew long-standing trade agreements to respond to a changing world.

“Trade is a very powerful engine of growth, innovation, competition and productivity ... Hopefully if it is well done, it can be a win-win for all countries in those negotiations,” she said, when asked about the NAFTA talks.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The communique said member countries agreed to work together to reduce “excessive global imbalances,” and to look more carefully at potential side-effects that prolonged low interest rates could have on asset prices and economic activity.

Policymakers also had less to cheer on inflation and wages, which remain weak despite a strengthening recovery that prompted the IMF to upgrade its global growth forecast.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that while subdued price and wage growth has become a common phenomenon in advanced economies, it was ”only a question of time“ for them to accelerate as the economy gathers momentum.”

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said the key was patience.

“The bottom line in terms of policy is that we are confident that as the conditions will continue to improve, the inflation rate will gradually converge in a self-sustained manner,” he said.

“But together with our confidence, we should also be patient because it’s going to take time.”",Global policymakers grapple with half-baked recovery short of wage growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-g20/global-policymakers-grapple-with-half-baked-recovery-short-of-wage-growth-idINKBN1CK029

Stokes, 26, is England’s vice captain and one of their most important players, but his participation in next month’s Ashes series against Australia has been thrown into doubt after he was released under investigation following the incident.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A key attorney executing BlackBerry Ltd’s patent licensing strategy has left the company, the second recent departure from the team tasked with making money from the Canadian company’s intellectual property.

Victor Schubert, who was a licensing director for BlackBerry, told Reuters in a brief LinkedIn message that he was no longer with the company. He did not say when he left or why.

Monetizing the company’s intellectual property is a key part of Chief Executive John Chen’s plan for turning around the company whose revenues have declined for six straight years as sales of its once ubiquitous smartphones have tumbled.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment on Schubert. Two switchboard operators at the Canadian company said his name was not in a global employee directory.

News of his exit follows the recent departure of Mark Kokes, who lead BlackBerry’s overall patent strategy. Kokes last month joined a health technology company.

Schubert joined BlackBerry in March 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile, as the company was embarking on a major push to boost licensing revenue.

BlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of some 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications.

Schubert has created and executed patent-licensing programs for at least four companies, including BlackBerry, dating back to 1992, according to his LinkedIn profile. It lists portfolio mining, patent valuation and negotiating patent sales as areas of expertise.

He was due to represent BlackBerry at a Seattle-area patent conference next month to discuss how operating companies can make money off their intellectual property, according to an agenda posted on the conference website in August. He is no longer listed as a panelist.

BlackBerry disclosed it had secured royalty-bearing deals with Cisco Systems Inc and another company that it did not name soon after Schubert joined. It also filed patent infringement lawsuits during his tenure against Nokia and Avaya Inc [AVXX.UL] that are ongoing.

BlackBerry on Thursday disclosed that it had settled another lawsuit, filed against low-end Android phone manufacturer BLU Products Inc.

Zweli Mkhize, one of the ANC’s “top six” leaders, also called for an end to factionalism within the party at a public lecture late on Friday, saying it was playing into the hands of the opposition.

Mkhize is in the running to replace Zuma as ANC leader at the party’s elective conference in December, and his campaign has been gathering momentum in recent weeks.

The battle between the two frontrunners for ANC leader - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, an ex-wife of Zuma and former chairwoman of the African Union - has bitterly divided the party that has governed South Africa since the end of white minority rule in 1994.

Affable and a long-serving cadre, Mkhize is touted as a compromise candidate who could soothe tensions between the party’s primary factions. He is also well-liked by investors unnerved by the party’s swing toward populist policies.

“We see fractions and divisions in the regions, at the national level. And you’ve got court cases all over,” Mkhize told ANC supporters packed into a hall in the Kagiso township to the west of Johannesburg.

“We need to say to each other enough is enough. ... The image of the African National Congress rests on the behaviour of its own leaders,” Mkhize said.

Earlier on Friday, South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling reinstating 783 corruption charges against Zuma from before he became president.

Zuma, who has denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office, has asked prosecutors to “consider representations” before deciding whether to proceed against him.

Mkhize avoided mentioning Zuma by name in his speech in Kagiso. He hails from Zuma’s home province of Kwa-Zulu Natal and was formerly a staunch Zuma supporter.

Asked whether Zuma should step down as president after a new ANC leader is elected in December, Mkhize said that would be up to the party to decide.

Zuma’s term as president ends in 2019, when South Africa next holds a general election, but his predecessor Thabo Mbeki was ousted before the end of his term in 2008 after losing out in a power struggle with Zuma.

“We believe the ANC is strong enough to survive all of this, and we want to be able to show that the ANC is serious about acting on corruption,” Mkhize said.",South Africa's ANC needs to put an end to scandals: official,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CJ0B9-OZATP

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility.
Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll.","Unlike the nerve-jangling elections earlier this year in the Netherlands, France and Britain, Germany’s has been notably dull. The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Sunday called for calm less than 24 hours ahead of a deadline from Spain’s central government for him to clarify whether he has declared independence for Catalonia or not.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has not been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Sunday that if article 155 was invoked, the government would replace the Catalan government with a new set-up to manage the region autonomously, which could be run by politicians or technocrats. Within three months, elections would be held.",Catalan leader calls for calm ahead of Madrid deadline,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/catalan-leader-calls-for-calm-ahead-of-madrid-deadline-idINKBN1CK0J0?il=0

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

The militants controlled Mogadishu between 2007 and 2011 but withdrew as fighting raged.

REUTERS/Erik De Castro

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The battle for the city of Raqqa, which Islamic State had used as its headquarters in Syria, is drawing to an end.

Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic “caliphate” Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries.

Following are some facts about Raqqa:

THE CITY

Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.

Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.

THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.

The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.

ITS PEOPLE

The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians.

The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.

Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.

Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.

Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.

The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.

Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa’s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule.

AFTER THE FIGHTING

The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.

The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border.

The SDF’s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured.

The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.

Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.

Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.

HERITAGE

A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point.

It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged.

Ophelia, the sixth major hurricane of the Atlantic season, is due to make landfall on the south west coast of Ireland at around 0500 GMT on Monday, the Irish weather service said, describing the storm as “unprecedented.”

Hurricane force winds are likely off Ireland’s south coast but they are expected to ease before they reach the coastline, said the weather service, which has declared a Status Red weather alert.

The weather service has warned some gusts may exceed 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour).

The government has also warned of localized coastal flooding and likely disruption to transport and electricity services.

Asked if it was likely to be the worst storm in half a century, he said the “comparable weather event” was Hurricane Debbie, which killed 12 in Ireland in 1961. Ophelia has the potential to be a life-threatening event in Ireland, he said.

The storm is likely to pass close to a west of Ireland golf course owned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has been planning a wall to protect its greens from coastal erosion.

The storm has the potential to reshape stretches of the Irish coast, John Sweeney, a climatologist at Maynooth University,” said.

“It is going to be perhaps an event comparable to Debbie in 1961 which has effectively marked many of the coastlines of the west coast of Ireland to the present day,” Sweeney told state broadcaster RTE.

Members of the armed forces have been sent to Tralee on the south west coast to build coastal defenses with sandbags.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini en hausse vendredi, soutenue par les valeurs technologiques, sur fond de résultats de banques et de statistiques contrastés.

L‘indice Dow Jones a gagné 30,71 points, soit 0,13%, à 22.871,72.

Le Standard & Poor’s 500, plus large, a progressé de 0,09% à 2.553,17 et le Nasdaq Composite a avancé de 0,22% à 6.605,80.

Le Dow affiche une progression hebdomadaire de 0,43%, le S&P-500 de 0,15%, tous les deux en hausse pour la cinquième semaine d‘affilée. Le Nasdaq a pris 0,24%, enregistrant lui sa troisième semaine consécutive de gains.

Les prix à la consommation ont réalisé en septembre leur plus forte progression en huit mois aux Etats-Unis en raison d‘une envolée des prix à la pompe avec le passage d‘ouragans sur le sud du pays, mais l‘inflation sous-jacente peine toujours à décoller. L‘indice “core” CPI, hors essence et alimentation, n‘a augmenté que de 0,1%.

Les ventes au détail ont elles enregistré leur plus forte progression en deux ans et demi, grâce notamment à la reconstruction et aux travaux entrepris dans les régions dévastées par les ouragans Harvey et Irma

“C‘est un environnement favorable à la prise de risque. Le contexte économique et la croissance des bénéfices, combinés à une inflation basse signifient que les taux d‘intérêt restent bas et que le dollar est sur une tendance baissière et que la prise de risque est récompensée”, estime Jack Ablin, de chez BMO Private Bank.

Le dollar est passé en territoire négatif face à un panier de devises de référence et le rendement des Treasuries à 10 ans est tombé à 2,28%, perdant plus de quatre points de base, après la publication des chiffres de l‘inflation.

Si le dollar s‘est un peu repris par la suite, il a perdu 0,75% sur la semaine, accusant sa plus mauvaise performance hebdomadaire depuis cinq semaines.

RÉSULTATS CONTRASTÉS POUR BoA ET WELLS FARGO

Après JPMorgan & Chase et Citigroup, qui ont ouvert jeudi le bal des résultats du troisième trimestre en annonçant une baisse de leurs revenus de trading, c‘était au tour vendredi de Bank of America et Wells Fargo.

Le marché attend de voir si la croissance des bénéfices justifie des valorisations très élevées alors que le S&P-500 affiche un gain de 14% depuis le début de l‘année.

“En raison du poids des financières dans l‘économie, le marché aime voir de quelle manière leurs résultats, la croissance du crédit par exemple, témoignent de la santé de l‘économie”, explique Nana Adae, de chez J.P.Morgan Private bank.

Ceux de BoA ont été bien accueillis. La deuxième banque américaine, qui a profité de sa politique de strict contrôle des coûts et des relèvements de taux d‘intérêt décidés par la Réserve fédérale, a publié un bénéfice sur la période juillet-septembre en hausse de 15%. L‘action a clôturé sur un gain de 1,49%.

En revanche, Wells Fargo a lâché 2,75%, après avoir annoncé un bénéfice en repli de 18,6%, pénalisé par des frais juridiques et une baisse des revenus du crédit immobilier.

Le compartiment des financières termine sur un léger repli de 0,04%, Goldman Sachs affichant un recul de 0,53% et JPMorgan de 0,13%.

RECORD HISTORIQUE DE NETFLIX

Seuls cinq des onze secteurs du S&P-500 ont fini en hausse, celui des technologiques affichant la meilleure performance avec +0,52% .

Facebook, Apple et Microsoft, qui a touché un record de 77,87 dollars en séance, ont terminé avec des gains respectifs de 0,69%, 0,63%, et 0,5%.

Netflix, qui publiera ses résultats lundi, s‘est adjugé 1,85% après avoir touché un record historique à 200,81 dollars. Le service de vidéo en ligne bénéficie d‘une série de relèvement de cours, Goldman Sachs et certains courtiers estimant qu‘il pourrait augmenter ses prix sans décourager abonnés.

Le secteur de la santé a perdu 0,3%. Donald Trump a signé jeudi un décret destiné à contourner certaines obligations imposées par l‘Obamacare, la réforme du système de protection santé que le nouveau président américain n‘est pas parvenu à faire annuler par le Congrès.

Les assureurs Centene a perdu 3,33%, Molina Healthcare a abandonné 3,37% et Anthem 3,11%.

Le secteur des télécoms a cédé 0,71%, plus forte baisse sectorielle. Verizon, plus forte baisse du Dow, cédé 1,01% et AT&T a perdu 0,45%, après avoir chuté de 6,10% jeudi.

Environ 5,8 milliards d‘actions ont changé de mains sur les marchés américains, à comparer à une moyenne de 6,1 milliards au cours des 20 derniers jours.

Sur le front pétrolier, les cours du brut ont gagné plus de 1,6% soutenus à la fois par les solides chiffres des importations chinoises de brut et par le refus de Donald Trump de certifier que l‘Iran respecte l‘accord international sur son programme nucléaire.

Dans un revirement stratégique attendu, le président américain a en outre annoncé son intention d‘adopter une attitude globalement beaucoup plus ferme à l‘égard de la République islamique.","Wall Street termine en hausse, portée par les techs",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1CI2W6-OFRBS

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs is trying to extricate itself from a box by thinking outside it. The Wall Street firm has set up a small team in what’s known internally as the Innovation Lab, to cook up supposedly clever ideas for big clients. The resulting acquisitions may end up destroying value for the shareholders of the companies involved, but Goldman’s own investors should be pleased the investment bank is trying new things.

Giving advice is at the core of the $94 billion institution run by Lloyd Blankfein, which routinely ranks atop the closely watched league tables. Clients such as ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce giant Amazon turn to Goldman for assistance. Competition is fierce, though, especially since smaller shops started gobbling more market share after the financial crisis. And fees are shrinking.

Dealmaking in the United States is equivalent to 6 percent of total company market value, according to data collated by Credit Suisse. That’s stubbornly below the historical 9 percent average. Adding to the sense of urgency perhaps is Goldman’s trading operation. It makes up a bigger share of the top line, and has been lackluster.

Revenue from buying and selling bonds, yen, oil and the like fell 40 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. Earnings due next week are likely to be glum again amid low levels of volatility and a market that, most banks warn, is down around 15 percent.

Adding some luster to the M&A franchise therefore makes sense. The trouble is that for a big institution, small initiatives can take years to show results. Goldman is also growing its retail-bank offering, Marcus, which could generate returns on equity that surpass 15 percent, it says – but is still too small to require separate disclosure. That, and Goldman’s plans to freshen up its trading arm, will command far more attention than whatever may come out of the Innovation Lab. At this point, though, experimentation is to be encouraged.",Breakingviews - Goldman necessity mothers M&A invention,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-goldman-necessity-mothers-ma-invention-idUSKBN1CG2FU

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Europas Aktienanleger haben sich auch am Donnerstag kaum aus der Deckung gewagt.

Zum einen lastete weiterhin die Unsicherheit über die politische Entwicklung in Spanien auf den Gemütern. Zum anderen dämpfte der feste Euro die Kauflaune. Der Dax notierte am frühen Nachmittag mit 12.970 Punkten kaum verändert in Sichtweite der 13.000er Marke, die er bislang noch nie erreicht hat.

Die gute Stimmung an der Wall Street, wo sich die großen Indizes zuletzt fast täglich von Rekord zu Rekord hangelten, ließ die meisten Anleger hierzulande kalt. Doch auch in New York sah es am Donnerstag nach einer leichteren Tendenz aus. Für die Eröffnung signalisierten die US-Futures ein Minus von etwa 0,1 bis 0,2 Prozent.

Spaniens Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy hatte am Mittwoch mit der Entmachtung der Regierung in Barcelona gedroht. Es sei abzuwarten, ob die Auseinandersetzung ein Risiko bleibe, sagte ein Händler. An der Börse in Madrid zeigten sich die meisten Anleger aber weiterhin beruhigt. Der Leitindex verharrte auf dem Niveau vom Mittwoch. Unterstützt wurde er von einer Empfehlung der Deutschen Bank für spanische Aktien. Die Analysten sehen ein geringeres Risiko für ein Auseinanderbrechen des Landes.

Die Stimmung an den europäischen Börsen litt auch unter dem hohen Euro, der die Absatzchancen der Exportunternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt verringert. Die Gemeinschaftswährung zog zeitweise um 0,2 Prozent auf ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch von 1,1880 Dollar an. Am Finanzmarkt wächst nach Einschätzung von Analysten die Skepsis über den geldpolitischen Zeitplan der US-Notenbank Fed.

TASS cited a Russian parliamentarian at the time as saying Moscow would call on the two countries to use the opportunity to have direct talks to try to narrow their differences.

But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Korea’s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

TORONTO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Friday it reached a tentative labor agreement with striking workers at its CAMI plant in Canada, ending an almost month-old dispute.

Some 2,500 workers at the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, in southern Ontario, walked off the job on Sept. 18 after the U.S. automaker rejected a union call to designate the factory as lead production site for the Chevrolet Equinox model in North America.

“These members have shown incredible courage and strength by standing up for good jobs and a secure future for their families and their community,” Jerry Dias, president of Unifor National, the main union leading the contract talks, said in a statement.

“This strike has shown all of Canada why a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement must address the needs of working people first,” he said.

The agreement is subject to member ratification, and Unifor said details of the deal will not be released until after the vote is held. The ratification vote has not yet been scheduled.

This week, the dispute ratcheted up when GM warned the union that it would start winding down production at the CAMI plant and ramp up output of the popular Equinox SUV at two plants in Mexico unless workers called off their strike.

The union had blamed NAFTA and Mexico’s cheaper labor costs for job losses.

GM moved production of the Terrain SUV to Mexico this year, resulting in about 400 layoffs at CAMI.

Dias said on Thursday that GM had ”declared war on Canada,“ and called the labor dispute ”the poster child of what’s wrong with NAFTA.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

The energy sector gained 0.6 percent as oil prices were lifted by strong Chinese oil import data, as well as by turmoil in the Middle East. U.S. crude prices settled up 1.7 percent at $51.45 a barrel.[O/R]

Canadian Natural Resources was among the biggest lifts to the index, rising 1.4 percent to C$41.21, while Cenovus Energy advanced 2 percent to C$12.14.

But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.

Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit. Some investors are planning to oppose Chairman James Murdoch’s re-election because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner Twenty-First Century Fox. But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.

Sky investor Royal London Asset Management had a point last week when it called Murdoch’s dual role “inappropriate” and said shareholders would be better served by a truly independent chairman during the takeover. Shareholder advisory groups, meanwhile, object to Sky’s executive pay. One problem is that some long-term incentive packages could pay out with no performance conditions if Fox’s offer gets the green light, according to Glass Lewis.

Murdoch survived an investor backlash last year, winning election with around 70 percent support. Strip out Fox’s stake and abstentions, however, and just half of Sky’s independent shareholders backed the chairman.

Concerns about conflicts of interest are more pressing this time. Fox’s bid is on ice until at least March 2018 while UK authorities study its effects on the country’s media ownership and broadcasting standards. Sky investor Crispin Odey has argued that the delays are beginning to make the offer look on the low side.

That logic is questionable. When it was launched in December 2016, Fox’s offer of 10.75 pounds per share represented a 40 premium to Sky’s market value. The shares would probably fall to around 8 pounds if the bid is blocked. Notwithstanding their concerns about Murdoch’s independence, most Sky shareholders would bite Fox’s hands off if they got a chance to vote on the bid.

That is why investors might hesitate before lodging a protest vote as long as Fox and the Murdoch family are under a regulatory microscope. Campaigners have argued that past sexual harassment and phone-hacking scandals in the Murdoch empire are grounds for blocking the takeover. Drawing attention to the family’s governance shortcomings could add to the political pressure on UK Media Secretary Karen Bradley, who must rule on the deal. Sky shareholders have legitimate complaints. But those thinking with their wallets may decide to keep quiet.",Breakingviews - Sky investors choose between profit and principles,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-sky-investors-choose-between-profit-and-principles-idUSKBN1CH16I

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

Any close races might not be settled until Monday, however, given the large number of postal ballots, which were taken out by roughly one in seven registered voters. The bulk of those ballots will not be counted until Monday.",Europe's migration crisis casts long shadow as Austria votes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-election/europes-migration-crisis-casts-long-shadow-as-austria-votes-idUSKBN1CJ0T8

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market’s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P .SPX, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017’s rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

“If it’s just a mean-reversion trade, then it’s probably going to last another few weeks and then we’re back to the old winners,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If it’s something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that.”

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), railroads CSX Corp (CSX.O) and Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) and steel company Nucor Corp (NUE.N) stand to yield insight into the economy’s health.

September’s stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September’s stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

“In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump’s election,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States .CESIUSD, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent.

“We’ve just had better data,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index .BADI.

“Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,” Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials (XLF.P), industrials (XLI.P) and energy (XLE.P), and outflows for technology (XLK.P) and healthcare (XLV.P), according to Lipper data.

“There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth ”hasn’t been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings.”

“For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year,” Warne said.",Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/cyclical-sector-rally-banks-on-global-economic-expansion-idUKKBN1CI1E6

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares hit an all-time high on Friday as Goldman Sachs and other brokerages raised their price targets on the world’s biggest online-streaming company, citing its ability to raise fees without scaring away customers.

The home of “House of Cards” and “Narcos” has been spending heavily on new shows and acquiring the rights to other TV series as it looks to lure more people away from traditional cable TV.

To help fund that spending - a sticking point with the company’s critics - Netflix said it would raise prices for two of its three main subscription plans.

“Content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it),” Goldman analyst Heath Terry wrote in a note.

Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, although that quarter will not reflect the recent price increases, which take effect in November.

Goldman expects the company to report that it added a net 1.1 million U.S. and 4.3 million international subscribers in the third quarter, partly driven by new shows such as “Ozark.”

The number of subscribers is Wall Street’s most closely watched gauge of the company’s growth. Goldman’s estimate is above most other analysts, who are on average expecting 810,000 U.S. and 3.69 million international subscriber additions, according to FactSet.

“we believe upward revisions to consensus estimates will ultimately drive further outperformance,” Terry said.

Goldman, which has a “buy” rating on the stock, boosted its price target to $235 from $200. The median price target on Netflix’s stock is $208, which has moved up 22 percent over roughly three months, showing Wall Street’s growing bullishness.

Netflix shares rose to an all-time high of $200.82 on Friday. They have jumped 58 percent so far this year.

JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth lowered his estimate for net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter by 255,000 to 6.7 million due to a modest uptick in churn, but said the fee increase was clearly a positive for Netflix.

Anmuth raised his Netflix price target on Friday to $225 from $210.

Not everybody is on board with Netflix’s aggressive spending, however.

“The thing that has kept us on the sidelines is ... this company is continuing to burn cash,” said Michael Scanlon, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, adding that Netflix was up against many deep-pocketed competitors.

Netflix expects to spend $6 billion this year and $7 billion in 2018 to produce original shows and movies to stay ahead of Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Prime Video service and Hulu.

Earlier this week, Hulu bid out others for U.S. rights to “This is Us.” The company expects to spend about $2.5 billion in 2017 on buying movies and TV show rights.

Also, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said in August it will stop providing new movies to Netflix from 2019 and launch its own streaming service.

Hulu dropped the price of its cheapest plan package by $2 for the first year of subscription, days after Netflix raised prices. The company last disclosed the size of its subscriber base in May 2016 as 12 million paying customers, according to Variety.

Netflix had nearly 104 million members as of June 30.

Analysts expect Netflix to report a third-quarter adjusted profit of 32 cents per share, and revenue up 30 percent to $2.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","Wall Street raises targets on Netflix, citing price increases",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-stocks/wall-street-raises-targets-on-netflix-citing-price-increases-idUSKBN1CI28K?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Madrid/Barcelona (Reuters) - Einen Tag vor Ablauf des Ultimatums der Regierung in Madrid hat der katalanische Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont zu Ruhe und Gelassenheit aufgerufen.

In einer kurzen Stellungnahme am Sonntag ließ er jedoch offen, wie seine für den Streit über die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens entscheidende Stellungnahme ausfallen wird. “Die Regierung und ich wollen unsere Verpflichtung gegenüber dem Frieden, dem Gemeinsinn, der Gelassenheit und auch der Demokratie bekräftigen als Fundament für die Entscheidungen, die wir fällen müssen”, erklärte Puigdemont lediglich. Am Samstag hatte die Zentralregierung gewarnt, sollte die bis spätestens Montag erwartete Antwort auf die Frage, ob Katalonien die Abspaltung erklärt habe, unklar ausfallen, dann werde dies als Proklamation der Unabhängigkeit aufgefasst.

Puigdemont hatte am Dienstag im katalanischen Parlament zwar erklärt, die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens sei gegeben. Er setzte sie aber gleichzeitig außer Vollzug. Spaniens Regierungschef Mariano Rajoy setzte Puigdemont daraufhin eine Frist bis Montagvormittag, um zu erklären, ob er einseitig die Unabhängigkeit erklärt habe oder nicht. Sollte die Regionalregierung die Loslösung von Spanien proklamieren, gibt es eine nochmalige Frist bis Donnerstag, um die Loslösung von Spanien zu widerrufen. Falls die Regionalregierung auf die Unabhängigkeit besteht, will Rajoy Puigdemont und sein Kabinett entmachten.

INNENMINISTER: PUIGDEMONT MUSS JA ODER NEIN SAGEN

Am Samstag hatte der Madrider Innenminister im Sender Cope eine eindeutige Stellungnahme von Puigdemont gefordert. “Er muss ja oder nein sagen.” Bei einer ambivalenten Antwort werde die spanische Regierung die angezeigten Maßnahmen ergreifen müssen.

Die linksradikale Partei CUP im katalanischen Parlament bestand am Samstag darauf, dass Puigdemont die Unabhängigkeit ausrufen müsse. “Wir bitten darum, dass am Montag die Antwort auf die Anforderungen von Rajoy die Ausrufung der katalanischen Republik ist”, sagte CUP-Sprecherin Nuria Gibert. Ihre Partei rufe zu Kundgebungen in der kommenden Woche auf.

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idUSKBN1CK05A?il=0

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

The militants controlled Mogadishu between 2007 and 2011 but withdrew as fighting raged.

“The French Presidency has started discussing this case with the Grande Chancellerie de la Legion d‘honneur,” a spokeswoman said. “A decision will be taken after this discussion.”

Berlin (Reuters) - Wenige Tage vor Beginn der Sondierung einer Jamaika-Koalition aus Union, FDP und Grünen scheinen die Beteiligten noch im Wahlkampfmodus zu sein.

Betont werden vor allem Unterschiede, etwa in der Flüchtlings- oder Finanzpolitik. Dabei zeichnen sich bereits Bereiche ab, in denen alle vier Parteien gemeinsame Ziele haben. Sie könnten Teil einer Positiv-Liste sein, mit der bei den Sondierungen vergleichsweise unstrittige Fragen definiert werden.

STEUERENTLASTUNG

Ein Dauerthema der Finanzpolitik wollen die möglichen Koalitionäre angehen: Alle vier Parteien wollen kleine und mittlere Einkommen steuerlich entlasten. Sie haben dem sogenannten Mittelstandsbauch im aktuellen Steuertarif den Kampf angesagt. Darunter versteht man eine überproportionale steuerliche Belastung unterer und mittlerer Einkommen. Über den Umfang der steuerlichen Entlastung herrscht aber Uneinigkeit.

DIGITALISIERUNG

CDU/CSU, FDP und Grüne streben den massiven Ausbau der Breitbandnetze an und setzten dabei auf moderne, aber teure Glasfaserleitungen. Vermutlich würde eine Jamaika-Koalition für den Internetausbau viel Geld in die Hand nehmen. Finanziert werden könnte dies aus den Erlösen aus der Vergabe von Lizenzen für den nächsten Mobilfunkstandard 5G. FDP und Grüne wollen die Anteile des Staates an der Telekom verkaufen und das Geld für den Internetausbau verwenden. Alle drei sind sich zudem in dem Ziel einig, die digitale Bildung zu verbessern. Nicht nur in der Schule, auch in den Fortbildungen sollen die neuen Techniken vermittelt werden.

BILDUNG

Alle Parteien wollen im Bildungssektor vorankommen. Unions-Fraktionschef Volker Kauder spricht gar von einer “Bildungsoffensive”. Diese könne “das große Projekt der gesamten Koalition werden”. FDP-Chef Christian Lindner hat betont, zwischen seiner Partei und den Grünen gebe es Gemeinsamkeiten bei der Reform des Bildungsföderalismus. In der FDP gibt es die Idee eines Staatsvertrags zu der Frage, wie der Bund bei der Finanzierung von Schulen helfen kann.

EINWANDERUNG

Beim Umgang mit Flüchtlingen bestehen zwar große Differenzen, doch haben sich alle vier Parteien für einen neuen gesetzlichen Rahmen der Einwanderung ausgesprochen. Während die Union ein “Fachkräfte-Zuwanderungsgesetz” anstrebt, wollen FDP und Grüne ein Einwanderungsgesetz. Beide Parteien setzen dabei auf ein Punktesystem, mit dem die Antragsteller je nach Bildung, Alter und anderen Eigenschaften bewertet werden. Diejenigen, die am besten zu Arbeitsmarkt und Gesellschaft passen, sollen dann nach Deutschland kommen dürfen. Dabei geht es nur um Länder außerhalb der Europäischen Union (EU) - innerhalb der EU sind die Grenzen für Arbeitnehmer bereits offen.

FLÜCHTLINGSURSACHEN

Unstrittig ist bei Union, FDP und Grünen, dass mehr gegen die Ursachen der Flüchtlingsbewegungen getan werden muss. Dabei gibt es zwei Stoßrichtungen: Die Förderung demokratischer Strukturen in den Heimatländern der Hilfesuchenden und der Aufbau einer funktionierenden Wirtschaft, damit die Menschen sich nicht aus reiner Not auf den Weg nach Europa machen. So fordern etwa die Grünen faire Handelsbedingungen für wirtschaftlich unterentwickelte Staaten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel will die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung afrikanischer Staaten unterstützen, um damit Fluchtursachen aus diesen Ländern zu bekämpfen.

EUROPA

Eine Jamaika-Koalition wäre ein Regierungsbündnis, das entschieden zur Europäischen Union steht. Union, FDP und Grüne stehen der europäischen Integration aufgeschlossen gegenüber. Allerdings gibt es massive Differenzen im Detail. So fordert etwa die FDP einen harten Euro-Rettungskurs und schließt beispielsweise den Ausschluss von Schuldnerländern wie Griechenland aus der Euro-Zone nicht aus. Die Grünen werten dagegen die von Merkel betriebene Konsolidierungspolitik als überzogen und fordern Abstriche an dem strikten Sparkurs.

AUSWÄRTIGE POLITIK

In den großen Linien der Außenpolitik ziehen alle vier Parteien an einem Strang. Sie sind bekennende Transatlantiker und rütteln nicht am Bündnis westlicher Staaten, auch wenn FDP-Chef Christian Lindner die Russland-Sanktionen infrage stellte. Auch in der Krise der Beziehungen zur Türkei verfolgen Schwarz, Gelb und Grün im Wesentlichen den gleichen Ansatz. Die Vereinten Nationen (UN) sind ein zentraler Bezugspunkt für alle vier Parteien für globale Politikansätze.

LÄNDLICHER RAUM

Zwar gibt es große Unterschiede in der Agrarpolitik unter den möglichen Koalitionären. Unstrittig ist aber, dass etwas für den ländlichen Raum getan werden muss. Jenseits der Ballungsräume gibt es Regionen, die unter Bevölkerungsschwund leiden sowie unter Defiziten in der Infrastruktur vom Straßen- und Schienennetz bis zur Ärzteversorgung. Um hier umzusteuern, könnte eine Jamaika-Koalition ein Investitionsprogramm beschließen, um die ländlichen Regionen wieder attraktiver zu machen.

KLIMA

Alle vier Parteien bekennen sich zu den Pariser Klimaschutz-Zielen. Damit scheinen die Weichen für Maßnahmen zur Verringerung des Kohlendioxid-Ausstosses gestellt, denn dieses Gas gilt als Hauptverantwortlicher für die Erderwärmung. Allerdings sind die Maßnahmen, wie eine CO2-Reduktion erreicht werden kann, zwischen den möglichen Partnern sehr umstritten. So will die FDP den Ausbau der Windenergie bremsen, die Grünen wollen das Gegenteil.",HINTERGRUND-Jamaika-Partner haben bereits jetzt Gemeinsamkeiten,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-idDEKBN1CK0FG

TORONTO (Reuters) - A U.S.-Canadian couple freed in Pakistan this week, nearly five years after being abducted in Afghanistan, reunited with the husband’s family on Saturday, the Associated Press reported.

Joshua Boyle and Caitlan Coleman arrived with their three children late on Friday in Toronto, where the husband said one of his children was murdered and his wife had been raped.

Citing an email from Boyle, the AP reported the family had “reached the first true ‘home’ that the children have ever known — after they spent most of Friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully.”

Boyle, a Canadian, and Coleman, an American were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network.

Pakistani troops rescued the family this week in the northwest of the country, near the Afghan border. The United States has long accused Pakistan of failing to fight the Haqqani network. The couple had three children while in captivity.

Boyle opened his Friday media statement by saying he was delayed due to a medical emergency involving one of his children.

AP, citing Boyle’s email, said his daughter had a cursory medical exam and hospital staff were “enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical.”

Boyle made a brief statement at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport late on Friday, calling on the Taliban “to provide my family with the justice we are owed.”

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s agricultural exports rose 13.9 percent during the first nine months of 2017, reaching 4.1 million tonnes compared to 3.6 million last year, agriculture ministry spokesman Hamid Abdel Dayim said on Sunday.

Egypt’s agricultural exporters have seen a surge in demand since the country floated its currency last November, allowing it to roughly halve in value as part of reforms tied to a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan agreement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL) said on Saturday it will not settle a long-standing intellectual property dispute with Monsanto Co (MON.N) over genetically modified (GM) cotton, despite some other Indian companies doing so in recent weeks.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that three Indian seed makers - Ajeet Seeds, Kaveri Seed Co Ltd KVRI.NS and Ankur Seeds - have agreed to resolve differences and end their arbitration proceedings with Monsanto (MON.N).

But Monsanto is yet to settle the dispute with Sri Rama Agri Genetics, Amar Biotech and NSL along with two group companies, Prabhat Agri Biotech and Pravardhan Seeds. “We do not want to compromise,” Narne Murali Krishna, a company secretary of NSL, said on the phone from Hyderabad, the capital of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. “On the IPR (intellectual property rights) matter, we’ll continue with our legal case in the Delhi High Court.”

Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Monsanto and local firm Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to more than 45 local cotton seed companies in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment.

Since then, Monsanto - which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE) for $66 billion - has been at loggerheads with the seed firms and India’s government over how much it can charge for its GM cotton seeds, costing it tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue a year.

“Based on the advice of competent IPR lawyers and communications of Monsanto with the Indian patent office, NSL realised that it was cheated by MMB’s false representations and claims on IPR,” Krishna said.

Earlier this year, citing a local law that excludes seeds from being patented, NSL’s Chairman and Managing Director M. Prabhakara Rao told Reuters that Monsanto should never have been allowed to collect royalties after an initial payment to use its technology.

At the very least, Rao added, prices should have been set by the government.

“Since we first signed the licensing agreement with Monsanto in 2004, we have paid 7.09 billion rupees ($109.59 million), which Monsanto should refund to NSL,” Krishna said.

Em um comunicado, os comitês de direção dos dois maiores grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi e as chamadas ECAs rejeitaram o plano de recuperação apresentado na noite de quarta-feira. Eles disseram que a empresa “parece ter perdido tempo negociando com um pequeno grupo de credores conflitantes, alguns dos quais também detém ações, para um acordo fracassado que foca exclusivamente na preservação do valor para os atuais acionistas”.

O plano de recuperação da Oi proposto pela administração e aprovado pelo conselho da empresa “ignora preocupações fundamentais dos credores, ameaçando a viabilidade da companhia no longo prazo e enriquecendo abusivamente os atuais acionistas”, disse o comunicado.

As ações da Oi exibiam forte alta nesta sexta-feira, impulsionadas por avaliação de analistas de que a proposta apresentada de reestruturação é positiva para os acionistas da operadora. A ação preferêncial subia mais de 21 por cento e a ordinária tinha alta acima de 11 por cento.

A nota traz a posição de dois grupos de credores da Oi, o Oi Creditors Groups e o grupo representado pela FTI Consulting, que, juntos, têm a receber cerca de 6,4 bilhões de dólares da operadora.

“Apesar de ter quase um ano e meio para fazer isso, a Oi não se envolveu em negociações sobre o plano de reorganização com o maior grupo organizado de credores, e a gerência só se reuniu com o Oi Creditor Groups e FTI no dia anterior ao arquivamento de seu último plano e depois do plano ter sido aprovado pelo conselho de administração, evitando efetivamente qualquer possibilidade de entrada dos credores e fornecendo evidências adicionais do conflito de interesses neste processo”, afirmam os credores.

Ao anunciar no fim de agosto que a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) analisaria a possibilidade de abrir processo de cassação de concessão e autorizações da Oi, representantes da agência já haviam mencionado eventual conflito de interesses nas negociações entre credores e acionistas.

Entre as críticas apontadas pelos grupos de credores estão “falta de dinheiro novo comprometido” e “estrutura de capital insustentável”.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

In ""Newton"", the eponymous protagonist faces the threat of Maoist rebels and indifferent officials as he helps conduct elections in a remote jungle in Chhattisgarh.

The film, which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February, opens in Indian cinemas this month.

Masurkar, who made his debut with the 2014 indie comedy ""Sulemani Keeda"", spoke to Reuters about the difficulties of filming in the jungle and what he learnt about Indian democracy.

Q: Where did the idea for ‘Newton’ come from?

A: I have always been interested in conflicts and history and I was thinking of doing something around democracy. I was brainstorming and generally typing words - constitution, electronic voting machines, etc. and I realized there was a story there. I kept exploring it and a story kept forming. Once the film got greenlit, I got a writer, Mayank Tewari, to help me out. We went to Chhattisgarh, did some research and kept writing.

Q: Any reason why you wanted to base this film in Chhattisgarh?

A: Chhattisgarh is situated in the heart of the country and yet we don't know too much about it. Also, this film is about elections and Naxalites (Maoist rebels) are opposed to elections. So that leads to a natural conflict in the story. You have this team of volunteers going into the jungle to conduct elections and the voters are Gondi locals who are already disenfranchised. The opposing force is dead against elections and they want to overthrow the government. All this meant that this was the best place to set the film.

Q: Was it difficult to build a film around concepts like democracy and franchise?



A: There is a lot of drama that plays out at the ground level and the way an election is conducted in these areas. Like election officials are sent by helicopters, they are protected by forest officers and there is always the danger of an attack. A lot of times, elections are not conducted or there are malpractices. I used to watch this on the news and thought this would be quite an adventure. Especially for someone who has spent his life at a desk job, this would be the highlight of his career, to conduct elections in places like this.

Q: Can you talk about the actual filming? Were there any difficulties shooting in a remote village in Chhattisgarh?

A: Our shooting budget was quite tight - it was only 5 crore rupees (50 million rupees or $780,000). We shot it in 37 days and shooting in the jungle was a new experience for all of us. We didn’t have the luxury of shooting on set, with lights and all that. We had a decent-sized crew and lots of actors, but everyone had to be very efficient because shooting time was limited to daylight.

We shot near this town called Dalli Rajhara. We were initially supposed to shoot in a different location near Raipur, but at the last moment the forest officer who was supposed to give us permission got arrested on a corruption charge. There was nobody to sign the papers. We were forced to change our location to Dalli Rajhara, which was actually closer to the Naxalite-controlled jungles. We spoke to people and realized that police and Maoists don't really bother film-makers. They don't take Bollywood that seriously.



Q: Did you learn anything about Indian democracy or the election system during the making of this film?

A: I am a Mumbai guy and I knew nothing about Chhattisgarh and I got to learn about a whole new culture. You realize you live in such a cocoon in Mumbai. We aren’t really exposed to how things work in the interiors.

Q: But does democracy work out there?

A: It’s difficult to answer. We all know we are not all treated equally. It works sometimes and sometimes it doesn‘t. Also, the film isn’t really getting into the democracy and whether it works or not. It is about human nature. We might talk about lofty ideals but at the end of the day, the people who are supposed to guard those ideals and enforce them, it is also about them. It is about how power and authority changes you.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cautioned Britain on Sunday over its push to secure a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump after it leaves the European Union.

Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate who lost out to Trump in last November’s election, also said Britain would face serious disruption if it left the EU without a negotiated deal with Brussels.

The British government has talked up the prospect of bilateral trade deals with the United States and others as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU following last year’s surprise referendum vote to leave.

Asked about the prospects of a British-U.S. deal, Clinton told the BBC: “You’re making a trade deal with somebody who says he doesn’t believe in trade, so I‘m not quite sure how that’s going to play out over the next few years.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May visited Trump in January to talk trade. The countries share $200 billion of trade each year.

But May has since intervened in a dispute between U.S. aerospace firm Boeing and Canadian planemaker Bombardier, lobbying in the interests of Bombardier to try to protect jobs at its factory in Northern Ireland.

Clinton also said Britain would be at a “very big disadvantage” if divorce negotiations with the EU failed, and went on to compare the factors behind the Brexit vote to her own election loss.

“Looking at the Brexit vote now it was a precursor to some extent to what happened to us in the United States... The amount of fabricated, false information that your voters were given by the ‘Leave’ campaign,” she said.

She said her own presidential campaign was subject to similar treatment, citing the spread of false stories by online news outlets, and warned that Britain and other countries must be alert to the risks of such new media.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose and stocks on Wall Street hit record highs. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Policymakers could, however, find solace in another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. The rise was the biggest since January and lifted the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in the CPI. The jump in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent gain in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices ticked up 0.1 percent as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles, furniture and medical care declined. The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August.

In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now advanced by the same margin for five consecutive months.

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed “many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.”

INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SLIP

Adding to the debate, the University of Michigan’s survey of consumers showed consumer’s inflation expectations over the medium term slipped in early October.

While the Fed could still increase borrowing costs in December for a third time this year, it would probably be hard for the central bank to push through the three rate hikes it has forecast for 2008, if the slow inflation trend persists.

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The pick-up in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. The growth outlook was boosted by another report from the Commerce Department showing inventories recorded their biggest gain in nine months in August.

Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period. The Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace after the data.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.","Gasoline boosts U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-boosts-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUSKBN1CI1NZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market’s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P .SPX, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017’s rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

“If it’s just a mean-reversion trade, then it’s probably going to last another few weeks and then we’re back to the old winners,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If it’s something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that.”

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), railroads CSX Corp (CSX.O) and Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) and steel company Nucor Corp (NUE.N) stand to yield insight into the economy’s health.

September’s stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September’s stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

“In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump’s election,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States .CESIUSD, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent.

“We’ve just had better data,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index .BADI.

“Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,” Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials (XLF.P), industrials (XLI.P) and energy (XLE.P), and outflows for technology (XLK.P) and healthcare (XLV.P), according to Lipper data.

“There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth ”hasn’t been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings.”

“For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year,” Warne said.",Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/cyclical-sector-rally-banks-on-global-economic-expansion-idUSKBN1CI1E6

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s political crisis shifts from barricades to the ballot box on Sunday with gubernatorial elections that could hand the demoralized opposition a major victory against President Nicolas Maduro’s government.

The ruling Socialist Party currently controls 20 of 23 state governorships. But polls show the opposition Democratic Unity coalition poised to upend that, given voter anger at hunger and shortages stemming from an economic meltdown.

Having failed to remove Maduro in protests earlier this year that led to 125 deaths and thousands of arrests, the opposition hopes a strong showing can be parlayed into victory in next year’s presidential election.

The government, however, is confident of stemming losses.

It has been making liberal use of state resources in its candidates’ campaigns and is appealing to Venezuelans’ exhaustion with political turmoil to vote against the opposition’s “candidates of violence.”

The pro-government election board also has thrown up hurdles for the opposition that could impact final results.

Those include the relocation of 200 vote centers on security grounds - mostly away from pro-opposition areas - and a refusal to update the ballot to remove superfluous names of opposition politicians who lost in primaries.

Additionally, a plethora of opposition leaders and activists, including major figures Henrique Capriles and Leopoldo Lopez, are barred from office or detained on accusations of coup-plotting, corruption and other charges.

“The more obstacles they put up, the stronger we become,” said coalition election coordinator Liliana Hernandez, urging supporters to turn out despite disillusionment.

The government says Sunday’s votes, from remote Amazon and Andean communities to heavily populated Caribbean coastal areas, are proof Venezuela is no dictatorship contrary to increased foreign criticism this year.

“When you vote, you will be sending a message to the imperialists,” the Socialist Party’s powerful No. 2 Diosdado Cabello said at a campaign rally this week, blasting the United States which has imposed some sanctions on Venezuela.

“We must vote for the legacy of Hugo Chavez,” Cabello added, referring to the populist firebrand and Maduro predecessor who ruled between 1999-2013 before dying from cancer.

“GO CRY TO WASHINGTON!”

In contrast to the constant evoking of Chavez, the unpopular Maduro has been largely absent from his candidates’ rallies.

Even if the government loses a majority of governorships, Maduro has repeatedly said none of the newly-elected officials will be allowed to take office unless they pledge allegiance to a new legislative superbody elected controversially in July.

The opposition boycotted that vote and refused to recognize the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly, which supersedes all institutions including the opposition-controlled congress.

“If they don’t swear, they don’t take office, full stop,” Maduro said in a speech this week.

“Then they can go and cry to Washington!”

Some opposition supporters, particularly youths in a self-styled ‘Resistance’ movement at the front of pitched street battles earlier this year, have accused their leaders of selling out and legitimizing a dictator by taking part in Sunday’s vote.

But most appear to have swallowed their qualms.

“Too many people were dying, with few results,” said student Manuel Melo, 20, who lost a kidney from the impact of a water cannon during one protest. “I agree with the elections.”

Should the government suffer big reverses, it can mitigate the practical effect by reducing funding and responsibilities for governors, as it has in the past when local posts have gone to the opposition.

After the election, the opposition will seek to throw the focus straight back to its main demands: guarantees of free and fair conditions for the 2018 presidential vote, freedom for jailed activists, foreign humanitarian aid, and authority for congress.

The government has said it hopes Sunday’s vote will help revive a stalled mediation bid with the opposition in the Dominican Republic.

China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors.

China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said.

Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected.

To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance.

That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse.

Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors.",Breakingviews - Beijing’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-breakingviews/breakingviews-beijings-closer-embrace-is-bad-news-for-big-tech-idUSKBN1CH0HK

Khan, 52, plays a sleazy music producer in the film “Secret Superstar” and says he is second lead to teenager Zaira Wasim, playing a schoolgirl who defies her conservative Muslim family to pursue her dream of a singing career.

Khan’s last film “Dangal”, or wrestling pit, was based on the true story of a former wrestler who trains two of his daughters to become champions in the sport. It was the highest grossing movie for Bollywood, as India’s Hindi film industry is known, and was powered by huge collections in China.

“While both are about the empowerment of the girl child, I feel it (Secret Superstar) is a much bigger film,” Khan said in an interview in Singapore ahead of the movie’s release later this month. He and his wife have produced the film.

“While Dangal was about the dream of a father which a daughter fulfils, this is about the hopes and aspirations of a 14-year-old girl from a small town in India. I don’t know what the box office will be but it’s a bigger film than Dangal in what it’s trying to say.”

Three of Khan’s films are in Bollywood’s top four all-time hits. Besides Dangal, these include “PK”, in which he played an alien dealing with religious divisions in India, and “3 Idiots”, about the frailties in India’s education system.

All three have also done well in China, and Khan said he was “very happy with the type of relationship that’s building between me and my audience in this part of the world with each film”.

He also produced and acted in a popular television documentary series on social ills in India called “Satyameva Jayate”, or Truth Alone Triumphs.

That series led him to set up a non-profit to work on a project to ease the shortage of water in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, he said.

Despite the social messages in his movies, Khan said he has no desire to become politician, as some other Bollywood stars have.

“The desire in me to contribute back to society is something I can do very well in the field that I am in,” he said. “I don’t have to join politics. That’s an area I don’t ever want to go into.”

Khan, who belongs to India’s Muslim minority, was embroiled in controversy two years ago when he said his Hindu wife had asked him if they should move out of India over concerns about insecurity. Khan later said the family had no plans to leave.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government has been accused of intolerance towards liberal and dissenting views.

Khan said intolerance had not affected his ability to express himself as an actor.

”For me, when I‘m making a film, my primary responsibility is to give my audience a good time. Then if it’s giving a message which is important and creative, if it’s changing the way we look at things, great.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cautioned Britain on Sunday over its push to secure a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump after it leaves the European Union.

Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate who lost out to Trump in last November’s election, also said Britain would face serious disruption if it left the EU without a negotiated deal with Brussels.

The British government has talked up the prospect of bilateral trade deals with the United States and others as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU following last year’s surprise referendum vote to leave.

Asked about the prospects of a British-U.S. deal, Clinton told the BBC: “You’re making a trade deal with somebody who says he doesn’t believe in trade, so I‘m not quite sure how that’s going to play out over the next few years.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May visited Trump in January to talk trade. The countries share $200 billion of trade each year.

But May has since intervened in a dispute between U.S. aerospace firm Boeing and Canadian planemaker Bombardier, lobbying in the interests of Bombardier to try to protect jobs at its factory in Northern Ireland.

Clinton also said Britain would be at a “very big disadvantage” if divorce negotiations with the EU failed, and went on to compare the factors behind the Brexit vote to her own election loss.

“Looking at the Brexit vote now it was a precursor to some extent to what happened to us in the United States... The amount of fabricated, false information that your voters were given by the ‘Leave’ campaign,” she said.

She said her own presidential campaign was subject to similar treatment, citing the spread of false stories by online news outlets, and warned that Britain and other countries must be alert to the risks of such new media.

Police also used teargas to break up small demonstrations in Kenya’s three main cities - Kisumu, the capital and the port of Mombasa - defying a government ban on rallies in city centers. Hospital authorities said 20 people were injured in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold.

Kenya’s supreme court nullified the presidential election in August, citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The ruling opening the way to a repeat vote on Oct. 26.

But opposition leader Raila Odinga has refused to take part, saying the re-run should not happen until wide-ranging reforms are brought in to prevent another failed vote.

The election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway, pitting Kenyatta against six other candidates, none of whom polled more than 1 percent in August.

Odinga told Reuters that he might consider returning to the Supreme Court for clarification on whether the Oct. 26 poll was legal.

PROVOCATIONS

“As far as we are concerned, that (original Supreme court) ruling is still valid,” Odinga said during a visit to London.

“What we are demanding is that the electoral commission should respect the Supreme Court and carry out elections in accordance with the ruling.”

He supported protesters’ right to demonstrate, he said, but has so far stopped short of calling people onto the streets himself.

In Nairobi, opposition legislators were repeatedly teargassed as they tried to drive into the city center.

“We are asking Uhuru’s government to ... let us protest in peace and truth and we are saying we want change and we do not want Uhuru and his people,” said protester Mellen Kirumbo.

In Kisumu, protesters reacted angrily when police turned water cannon on them to prevent them from entering the city center.

“Our demonstrations have a (valid) basis and are peaceful,” said Odinga supporter Hezron Tirus Aloyo. “We condemn the directive ... on the limitation of our rights to demonstrate.”

The Jaramogi Oginga Odinga hospital in Kisumu, named after Odinga’s father, said it had admitted 20 patients injured in the demonstrations. Three had gunshot wounds, said superintendent Juliana Otieno.

Martin Kimani, the Director of the Kenyan government’s National Counter Terrorism Centre, said the authorities were trying to maintain law and order.

“A lot of those provocations or demonstrations taking place are an attempt to create the appearance of a crisis,” he said.",Kenya police shoot dead two during opposition protest: commissioner,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CI2GU-OZATP

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s ruling Communist Party has agreed to amend the party constitution, expected to embed President Xi Jinping’s political thought, ahead of next week’s five-yearly party congress in which Xi will tighten his grip on power.

The party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies, on Saturday passed a previously announced proposal to amend the constitution which will now be put to the Congress for formal approval.

A lengthy communique released by the party via state media offered praise for the past five years under Xi’s leadership, especially success in the fight against corruption, but did not say what wording would be inserted into the party constitution.

A key measure of Xi’s power will be whether he manages to have his name “crowned” in the party constitution, elevating him to the level of previous leaders exemplified by Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

Xi’s more recent predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, both had the party constitution amended to include their guiding thoughts, but without their names directly attached.

Jiang has his “Three Represents”, which embraced private entrepreneurs, written in, while Hu, Xi’s immediate predecessor, had his economic doctrine of “scientific development” included.

In the section of the communique mentioning former leaders’ theories, there was a reference to “the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s series of important speeches and new concepts, new thinking and new strategy on governing”, signaling that could be the phrasing used.

The party has also been pushing Xi’s “Four Comprehensives,” which refer to China working “comprehensively” to build a moderately prosperous society and strengthen reforms, rule of law and party discipline, as well as the “Four Greats”, which focus on party building and national rejuvenation.

The four-day Central Committee plenary meeting also approved reports by the party’s corruption watchdog of investigations into several former senior officials who have been sacked or jailed for graft, including Sun Zhengcai, once a contender for top leadership who was expelled from the party last month.

Since assuming power five years ago, Xi has mounted a sweeping campaign against deep-rooted corruption, with more than one million people punished and dozens of senior officials jailed.

The party has vowed that the campaign, overseen by close Xi ally Wang Qishan, will never end.

The Congress will open on Wednesday with a speech by Xi, the party’s head, details of which are a closely guarded secret ahead of time but will focus more on ideology than concrete policies.

Last October, the party gave Xi the title of “core” leader, a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the Congress, at which a new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, will be constituted.","China confirms will amend party constitution, likely to include Xi's theories",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-congress/china-confirms-will-amend-party-constitution-likely-to-include-xis-theories-idINKBN1CJ0E3

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in eight months in September as gasoline prices soared in the wake of hurricane-related production disruptions at oil refineries in the Gulf Coast, but underlying inflation remained muted.

The mixed report from the Labor Department on Friday comes as Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path and suggests a December interest rate increase is not a done deal.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose and stocks on Wall Street hit record highs. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Policymakers could, however, find solace in another report indicating that the economy was swiftly recovering from the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with a strong rebound in retail sales last month.

“The firmness in retail sales should override the enduring mystery of low inflation to spur a December Fed rate hike,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in August. The rise was the biggest since January and lifted the year-on-year gain in the CPI to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in August.

Gasoline prices surged 13.1 percent last month, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in the CPI. The jump in gasoline prices was the largest since June 2009 and followed a 6.3 percent gain in August.

The Labor Department said Harvey was reported to have impacted refinery capacity in the Gulf Coast and was likely a factor in last month’s increase in gasoline prices.

Outside gasoline, price pressures were benign. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices ticked up 0.1 percent as the increase in rental accommodation slowed and the cost of new motor vehicles, furniture and medical care declined. The so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent in August.

In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 1.7 percent. The year-on-year core CPI has now advanced by the same margin for five consecutive months.

The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, which has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target for more than five years. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that temporary factors such as one-off price cuts by wireless telephone companies are holding back inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 19-20 meeting published on Wednesday showed “many participants expressed concern that the low inflation readings this year might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.”

INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SLIP

Adding to the debate, the University of Michigan’s survey of consumers showed consumer’s inflation expectations over the medium term slipped in early October.

While the Fed could still increase borrowing costs in December for a third time this year, it would probably be hard for the central bank to push through the three rate hikes it has forecast for 2008, if the slow inflation trend persists.

Last month, food prices rose 0.1 percent after a similar gain in August. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in August. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.4 percent as manufacturers resort to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.

There were also decreases in the cost of medical care, apparel, and household furnishings. But the cost of mobile phone services rose 0.4 percent after 14 straight months of declines.

In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.6 percent in September likely as reconstruction and clean-up efforts in areas devastated by Harvey and Irma boosted demand for building materials and motor vehicles.

Retail sales were also buoyed by a surge in receipts at service stations, which reflected higher gasoline prices. Last month’s increase in retail sales was the largest since March 2015.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

The pick-up in core retail sales suggests the drag on the economy from the hurricanes will probably be modest. The growth outlook was boosted by another report from the Commerce Department showing inventories recorded their biggest gain in nine months in August.

Economists estimate the storms could subtract at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the April-June period. The Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace after the data.

“The sudden increase in retail demand is likely to cause third-quarter growth to come in somewhat better than expected before the hurricanes hit,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.","Gasoline boosts U.S. consumer prices, underlying inflation tame",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation/gasoline-boosts-u-s-consumer-prices-underlying-inflation-tame-idUSKBN1CI1NZ

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova won her first WTA title in more than two years at the Tianjin Open on Sunday, showing plenty of grit and determination as she came from behind in each set to beat Belarusian teenager Aryna Sabalenka 7-5 7-6(8).

The former world number one, who returned to the tour in April following a 15-month doping ban, started the stronger, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game, but struggled on serve and soon found herself trailing 4-1 in the first set.

The Russian managed to hold serve for the first time in the match at 4-2 and clung on grimly in the face of some hard hitting by her 19-year-old opponent before converting her fourth break point of the next game to get back on serve at 4-3.

Her nerves settled, Sharapova began to hit her stride, breaking Sabalenka again to go 6-5 up before closing out the set.

The Belarusian, playing her first WTA final, came back in the second set, opening up a 5-1 lead before serving to send the match into a decider, but Sharapova once again fought back to erase the deficit.

The 30-year-old broke Sabalenka twice in succession and held her nerve when facing a set point on serve at 5-4 to level things up, and broke the Belarusian to give herself the chance to serve out the match at 6-5.

But there was more drama to come. The Russian, who sent down seven aces during the contest, double faulted when facing a break point to gift Sabalenka the game and send the set into a tiebreak.

Sharapova, whose last title came at the Italian Open in May 2015, had three match points but Sabalenka survived them all before double faulting with the score at 8-8 to hand Sharapova another opportunity.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares hit an all-time high on Friday as Goldman Sachs and other brokerages raised their price targets on the world’s biggest online-streaming company, citing its ability to raise fees without scaring away customers.

The home of “House of Cards” and “Narcos” has been spending heavily on new shows and acquiring the rights to other TV series as it looks to lure more people away from traditional cable TV.

To help fund that spending - a sticking point with the company’s critics - Netflix said it would raise prices for two of its three main subscription plans.

“Content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it),” Goldman analyst Heath Terry wrote in a note.

Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, although that quarter will not reflect the recent price increases, which take effect in November.

Goldman expects the company to report that it added a net 1.1 million U.S. and 4.3 million international subscribers in the third quarter, partly driven by new shows such as “Ozark.”

The number of subscribers is Wall Street’s most closely watched gauge of the company’s growth. Goldman’s estimate is above most other analysts, who are on average expecting 810,000 U.S. and 3.69 million international subscriber additions, according to FactSet.

“we believe upward revisions to consensus estimates will ultimately drive further outperformance,” Terry said.

Goldman, which has a “buy” rating on the stock, boosted its price target to $235 from $200. The median price target on Netflix’s stock is $208, which has moved up 22 percent over roughly three months, showing Wall Street’s growing bullishness.

Netflix shares rose to an all-time high of $200.82 on Friday. They have jumped 58 percent so far this year.

JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth lowered his estimate for net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter by 255,000 to 6.7 million due to a modest uptick in churn, but said the fee increase was clearly a positive for Netflix.

Anmuth raised his Netflix price target on Friday to $225 from $210.

Not everybody is on board with Netflix’s aggressive spending, however.

“The thing that has kept us on the sidelines is ... this company is continuing to burn cash,” said Michael Scanlon, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, adding that Netflix was up against many deep-pocketed competitors.

Netflix expects to spend $6 billion this year and $7 billion in 2018 to produce original shows and movies to stay ahead of Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Prime Video service and Hulu.

Earlier this week, Hulu bid out others for U.S. rights to “This is Us.” The company expects to spend about $2.5 billion in 2017 on buying movies and TV show rights.

Also, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said in August it will stop providing new movies to Netflix from 2019 and launch its own streaming service.

Hulu dropped the price of its cheapest plan package by $2 for the first year of subscription, days after Netflix raised prices. The company last disclosed the size of its subscriber base in May 2016 as 12 million paying customers, according to Variety.

Netflix had nearly 104 million members as of June 30.

Analysts expect Netflix to report a third-quarter adjusted profit of 32 cents per share, and revenue up 30 percent to $2.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","Wall Street raises targets on Netflix, citing price increases",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-stocks/wall-street-raises-targets-on-netflix-citing-price-increases-idUSKBN1CI28K

Germans disgruntled with Merkel’s liberal migrant policy abandoned her party in droves in September’s national election. Having recorded the worst conservative result since 1949, she must now try to piece together an awkward alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens.

Those parties will this week begin discussions that could drag into 2018 about entering a marriage of convenience untested at the federal level.

The latest opinion poll put the SPD on 34.5 percent in the northern swing state of Lower Saxony, giving it a 1.5 point lead over Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) who had been 12 points ahead at the start of the campaign in August.

Exit polls are expected at 1600 GMT.

Simon Fink, political scientist at the University of Goettingen, said no one had dared to start coalition negotiations in Berlin ahead of the election in Lower Saxony, which is slightly bigger than the Netherlands and hosts major companies such as carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

“Everyone was scared that if they did something at the national level or committed themselves to something, then their colleagues in Lower Saxony could end up suffering,” he said.

“JAMAICA” ON THE HORIZON

Merkel’s reverse in September, along with the SPD’s insistence on going into opposition, left her with no viable option other than a “Jamaica” coalition, so named because the three parties’ colours correspond with the black, yellow and green of Jamaica’s flag.

It means the prospective partners will need to overcome yawning differences on issues ranging from immigration to European Union reform, tax and environmental protection.

Cem Ozdemir, co-leader of the Greens, said the three parties had not sought each other out but now had a responsibility to form a coalition that bore the hallmarks of their conservative, liberal and center-left identities.

“If the coalition comes off, it must not be a coalition that only agrees on the lowest common denominator. That won’t work,” he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper, adding that the trio needed a “shared narrative”.

A deal brokered last weekend between Merkel’s CDU and its conservative Bavarian sister party, the CSU, to cap the number of immigrants is likely to be hard for the Greens to swallow.

Merkel has acknowledged the difficulties ahead but added that “unusual combinations can of course bring the opportunity to find some solutions to things that had seemed unsolvable until now”.

“So now we need to put our noses to the grindstone,” she said on the campaign trail in Lower Saxony on Thursday.

An SPD-Green coalition has ruled the state for almost four years, but lost its majority when a Greens lawmaker defected to the CDU, triggering a snap election.

The SPD’s incumbent state premier, Stephan Weil, a 58-year-old former judge, fares better in the personal popularity stakes than his CDU rival Bernd Althusmann, a 50-year-old former army officer.

Althusmann had not given up hope on Saturday though, saying voters were making their decisions later and later. “It’s a question of mobilizing voters,” he said.",State vote unlikely to give Merkel boost in German coalition talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-election-lower-saxony/state-vote-unlikely-to-give-merkel-boost-in-german-coalition-talks-idUKKBN1CJ0T9?il=0

E’ quanto ha detto in un‘intervista a Reuters il presidente della Regione Lombardia, Roberto Maroni, aggiungendo che Milano ha dalla sua un dossier molto forte ma che ospiterà Ema solo se il governo italiano “riuscirà a farsi valere”.

Al momento il team responsabile della candidatura di Barcellona non ha commentato.

Dopo la Brexit, si è aperta una gara tra le principali città europee per la sede di Ema ed Eba -- l‘Agenzia europea per i medicinali e l‘Autorità bancaria europea -- che dopo il divorzio tra Londra e l‘Ue dovranno abbandonare la capitale britannica.

In attesa della decisione del 20 novembre, l‘Unione europea ha ricevuto 19 candidature per Ema. Quelle per Eba, tra cui spicca Francoforte, sono otto.

Oltre ai molti punti di forza di Milano, Maroni però mette in guardia che sulla scelta influiscono anche le “azioni di lobbying” dei vari Paesi.

“Attualmente la città più insidiosa è Vienna perché è area di interesse della Merkel che ha mire anche per avere l‘Eba a Francoforte....il governo italiano dovrebbe dire dire a Merkel ‘ti appoggiamo per Eba in cambio del tuo sostegno per Ema a Milano’”, ragiona Maroni.

Da un report pubblicato dalla Commissione europea poco prima del referendum catalano -- che non stila alcuna classifica -- si evince che Milano assieme a Vienna, Amsterdam, Copenhagen e Barcellona è tra le città che meglio rispetta i criteri richiesti.

Anche da un altro documento, diffuso sul sito di Ema, emerge che la stessa rosa di città è quella che meglio risponde ai requisiti sulla sede e la sua accessibilità, sull‘accesso a mercato del lavoro, cure mediche e istruzione, sulla continuità operativa e se la città ospita o no altre sedi di agenzie europee.

Tra i vantaggi che può offrire Milano, il presidente della Lombardia cita la disponibilità immediata della sede -- il ‘Pirellone’, il grattacielo progettato negli anni Cinquanta da Giò Ponti -- ma anche la vicinanza con Parma -- che già ospita l‘Autorità europea per la sicurezza alimentare (Efsa) -- con cui, dice, si potrebbe dare vita a una sorta di ‘Food and Drug Administration’ sul modello statunitese.

“Ema ha detto che il ‘Pirellone’ è perfetto e la Regione, che ne è proprietaria, potrebbe concederlo in affitto gratis per i primi anni. Inoltre Milano può contare su ottimi collegamenti ferroviari, aerei e su scuole internazionali”.

Oltre all‘Efsa di Parma, l‘Italia ospita anche la Fondazione europea per la formazione (Etf) a Torino.

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has not been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Sunday that if article 155 was invoked, the government would replace the Catalan government with a new set-up to manage the region autonomously, which could be run by politicians or technocrats.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain published proposals on Wednesday for a levy on social media firms and internet providers to help fund its online safety strategy, designed to tackle bullying, abuse and other risks for children and vulnerable users.

Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers have been critical of firms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, repeatedly calling on them to do more to stop the spread of extremist content online and help victims of abuse.

May first promised a levy on “social media companies and communication service providers” in her 2017 election manifesto.

On Wednesday, digital minister Karen Bradley published proposals for an Internet Safety Strategy including the levy, a code of practice on removing intimidating or humiliating content from social media, and online safety classes in schools.

“The internet has been an amazing force for good, but it has caused undeniable suffering and can be an especially harmful place for children and vulnerable people,” Bradley said in a statement.

“We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy.”

The government proposal, which invites views from the industry before being formulated into legislation, said the levy would initially be sought on a voluntary basis.

“We may then seek to underpin this levy in legislation, to ensure the continued and reliable operation of the levy,” the document said. “The levy will not be a new tax on social media.”

It likened the proposed levy to an existing one paid on a voluntary basis by the gambling sector to fund charitable work.

Social media firms have typically been exempt from regulatory fees that can apply to communication services.

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Slideshow (9 Images)

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

Any close races might not be settled until Monday, however, given the large number of postal ballots, which were taken out by roughly one in seven registered voters.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.

The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.

ITS PEOPLE

The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians.

The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.

Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.

Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.

Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.

The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.

Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa’s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule.

AFTER THE FIGHTING

The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.

The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border.

The SDF’s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured.

The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.

Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.

Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.

HERITAGE

A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point.

It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archaeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged.

Islamic State militants released a video of them bombing a large part of the Uwais al-Qarani shrine complex in March 2014.",Factbox: Raqqa - Battle for Islamic State's Syrian HQ near end,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa-factbox/factbox-raqqa-battle-for-islamic-states-syrian-hq-near-end-idUKKBN1CK0GP?il=0

Em um comunicado, os comitês de direção dos dois maiores grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi e as chamadas ECAs rejeitaram o plano de recuperação apresentado na noite de quarta-feira.

Por outro lado, uma fonte próxima da situação na empresa, disse que a direção da Oi recebeu mensagens de apoio ao plano por parte do China Development Bank, um dos credores da operadora brasileira.","SÃO PAULO/BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Um grupo de detentores de títulos e agências de crédito para exportação, que juntos são os maiores credores da Oi, disseram nesta sexta-feira que o plano de recuperação da operadora de telefonia brasileira visa proteger os atuais acionistas às custas dos credores.

Em um comunicado, os comitês de direção dos dois maiores grupos de detentores de títulos da Oi e as chamadas ECAs rejeitaram o plano de recuperação apresentado na noite de quarta-feira. Eles disseram que a empresa “parece ter perdido tempo negociando com um pequeno grupo de credores conflitantes, alguns dos quais também detém ações, para um acordo fracassado que foca exclusivamente na preservação do valor para os atuais acionistas”.

O plano de recuperação da Oi proposto pela administração e aprovado pelo conselho da empresa “ignora preocupações fundamentais dos credores, ameaçando a viabilidade da companhia no longo prazo e enriquecendo abusivamente os atuais acionistas”, disse o comunicado.

As ações da Oi exibiam forte alta nesta sexta-feira, impulsionadas por avaliação de analistas de que a proposta apresentada de reestruturação é positiva para os acionistas da operadora. A ação preferêncial subia mais de 21 por cento e a ordinária tinha alta acima de 11 por cento.

A nota traz a posição de dois grupos de credores da Oi, o Oi Creditors Groups e o grupo representado pela FTI Consulting, que, juntos, têm a receber cerca de 6,4 bilhões de dólares da operadora.

“Apesar de ter quase um ano e meio para fazer isso, a Oi não se envolveu em negociações sobre o plano de reorganização com o maior grupo organizado de credores, e a gerência só se reuniu com o Oi Creditor Groups e FTI no dia anterior ao arquivamento de seu último plano e depois do plano ter sido aprovado pelo conselho de administração, evitando efetivamente qualquer possibilidade de entrada dos credores e fornecendo evidências adicionais do conflito de interesses neste processo”, afirmam os credores.

Ao anunciar no fim de agosto que a Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) analisaria a possibilidade de abrir processo de cassação de concessão e autorizações da Oi, representantes da agência já haviam mencionado eventual conflito de interesses nas negociações entre credores e acionistas.

Entre as críticas apontadas pelos grupos de credores estão “falta de dinheiro novo comprometido” e “estrutura de capital insustentável”.

Por outro lado, uma fonte próxima da situação na empresa, disse que a direção da Oi recebeu mensagens de apoio ao plano por parte do China Development Bank, um dos credores da operadora brasileira.

O plano apresentado à Justiça na quarta-feira limita em 25 por cento a conversão de dívida em ações, bem abaixo do pretendido pelos principais de detentores de títulos da empresa.

O plano prevê uma capitalização de 9 bilhões de reais, dos quais cerca de 6 bilhões equivalem a dinheiro novo, sendo 3,5 bilhões de reais por parte dos detentores de títulos de dívida da Oi e 2,5 bilhões dos atuais acionistas. Os 3 bilhões de reais restantes poderão vir de conversão de debêntures em ações.",Maiores credores da Oi rejeitam plano de recuperação,https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idBRKBN1CI26J-OBRIN

“Everything is just going unbelievable,” Perez said greenside after signing off with a 24-under total of 264, four ahead of runner-up Keegan Bradley.

“It’s been a lot of work and a lot of dedication and it’s just coming together.”

Perez’s putter has run hot all week and there was no evidence of Sunday nerves as he rolled in three consecutive birdies from the second hole to extend his lead on a day of energy-sapping heat.

He shrugged off a lone bogey on the par-four sixth with a fourth birdie on the eighth, then coasted to victory with 10 consecutive pars.

It helped that none of his rivals rose to the challenge, with nearest contender Xander Schauffele, the PGA Tour rookie of the year, bumbling through an even-par 72 to finish joint third with South Korea’s Kang Sung.

Kang kept pace with Perez through his opening nine but his title hopes were crushed with a double-bogey on the par-five 10th and he bowed out with a 71.

The 2011 PGA Championship winner Bradley closed strongly with a bogey-free 67 but was left to rue a scratchy second round that left him too much ground to make up.

Japanese talent Hideki Matsuyama signed off with a 71 to finish tied fifth with Australia’s Cameron Smith, and headliner Justin Thomas, who was bidding for a third successive win at the tournament, ended tied 17 after a 67.

After pocketing a $1.26 million cheque and winning so early in the season, Perez said he had no plans to change his goals, his lifestyle or his ‘bad diet’.

“I‘m not getting ahead of myself, I‘m not going to look in the past,” he said.

“Like you said, I‘m a late bloomer... I‘m not going to change anything.”",Golf: Late bloomer Perez cruises to four-stroke win in Malaysia,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CK06T-OCASP

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Die Krypto-Währung Bitcoin hat am Donnerstag erstmals die Marke von 5000 Dollar durchbrochen.

Auf der Handelsplattform BitStamp verteuerte sich ein Bitcoin um bis zu 7,6 Prozent auf 5186 Dollar. Bitcoin ist die bekannteste und gemessen am Handelsvolumen wichtigste Cyber-Währung. Der Kurs liegt etwa 75 Prozent über dem Niveau vor rund einem Monat. Seit dem Anfang 2017 hat er sich mehr als verfünffacht. “Anleger scheinen Nachrichten über potenzielle Börsenschließungen förmlich zu ignorieren”, kommentierte Analyst Timo Emden vom Brokerhaus IG. Der Risikoappetit der Anleger sei zurückgekehrt.

Vor wenigen Wochen hatten in China Handelsplattformen für Bitcoin & Co ihren Betrieb eingestellt, nachdem Behörden vor den Risiken von Cyber-Währungen gewarnt hatten. Daraufhin war der Bitcoin-Kurs um mehr als 1000 Dollar eingebrochen. Auch Russland will den Handel mit dem per Computer geschaffenen Geld einschränken. So will das Land den Zugang zu bestimmten Internetseiten blockieren, die Krypto-Währungen anbieten.

Ein Grund für die jüngste Kursrally sind Analysten zufolge Spekulationen auf eine bevorstehende technische Neuerung bei Bitcoin. Am 25. Oktober werde es vermutlich zu einer weiteren Teilung der Währung kommen, sagte Mati Greenspan, Experte bei der Handelsplattform eToro. Eine solche Teilung wurde bereits Anfang August vollzogen, um die Ausbreitung der Währung zu beschleunigen. Sie wurde deshalb aufgespalten in Bitcoin und Bitcoin Cash. Nun solle zudem Bitcoin Gold entstehen, sagte Greenspan.

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets said its third-quarter profit fell 19 percent, due mostly to a $1 billion mortgage litigation accrual.

But management also revised its outlook on a key expense-related metric, saying the bank expects to spend 61 cents for every dollar of revenue it generates this year, up from a range of 60 to 61 cents. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry suggested Wells Fargo may also face issues hitting next year’s cost-efficiency target.

Management now hopes to spend 59 cents for every dollar of revenue next year, the high end of a target range of 55 to 59 cents, he said.

But much depends on loan growth and interest rates, as well as elevated costs from regulations, technology and “lingering sales practice issues,” Shrewsberry cautioned.

Wells Fargo’s loan balances at the end of the third quarter were $951.9 billion, down $5.6 billion from the second quarter and down $9.4 billion from a year earlier

“We are waiting for the quarter that Wells shows stronger momentum across the business and this was not the quarter,” analysts from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a client note.

The mortgage litigation accrual is for a still-pending lawsuit brought by a U.S. Justice Department-led task force, Shrewsberry told Reuters.

The Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group has reached multi-billion dollar settlements with other banks over pre-financial crisis conduct, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

“They’re working down toward the end of that list and now we’re sort of in discussions with them,” Shrewsberry said in an interview. “The billion dollars is in connection with that activity.”

The bank’s shares were last down 3.3 percent to $53.40.

SCANDAL WOES

Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a sales practices scandal for more than a year. It has acknowledged opening perhaps 3.5 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission, signing others up for unwanted auto insurance, charging some for a mortgage rate-lock feature they did not request and tacking other costly add-ons to accounts.

The bank also has the same underlying challenges as rivals, including a drop in mortgage refinancing, interest income rising slowly after a prolonged period of rock-bottom rates, expensive technology investments and new regulations.

That has made it hard for outsiders to quantify how Wells Fargo’s scandal has influenced results.

On a conference call, analysts asked management whether weak loan growth was attributable to consumers backing away from the bank due to the scandal, or to the bank’s caution about credit risk.

The bank missed consensus revenue expectations for the fourth straight quarter due to the weak loan growth, and its lending profit fell.

Overall earnings fell to $4.6 billion. On an adjusted basis, profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking and auto lending. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, which measures the difference between what banks spend on funds and what they generate from lending those funds, was 2.87 percent, down from 2.9 percent the prior quarter and below some analyst expectations.

The bank spent 65.5 cents per dollar of revenue during the quarter and 63.1 cents per dollar year-to-date.

Shrewsberry said the bank is committed to a previously stated plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent due to the legal charge.","Wells Fargo revises expense outlook, signaling profit difficulties ahead",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-results/wells-fargo-revises-expense-outlook-signaling-profit-difficulties-ahead-idUSKBN1CI1MC

Also this week, Weinstein was suspended from the British film academy BAFTA.","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled producer Harvey Weinstein on Saturday, after allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over the past three decades, a sharp smack for a Hollywood mogul known for powering a string of films to Oscar gold.

The academy said in a statement that its 54-member board of governors “voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.”

A representative for Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, had no immediate comment.

The expulsion from the film industry’s most prestigious organization follows allegations reported by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they had been raped.

Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

For Weinstein, who made a name for himself and his studio with the critical and commercial success of a number of small-budget independent films, the expulsion was just the latest fallout - both professional and personal - from allegations that have rocked an industry that has often looked the other way when confronted by reports of sexual misconduct.

In announcing the decision to oust Weinstein, the academy said it was also telegraphing a broader goal.

“We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues, but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over,” the academy said.

“What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society,” it said. “The board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.”

The New York Police Department said this week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

His accusers included the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who told The New York Times that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein more than 20 years ago, and actress and director Angelina Jolie, who told the publication that she “had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again.”

BROTHER ADVOCATED EXPULSION

The academy’s board gathered on Saturday to discuss the allegations against Weinstein and his inclusion in the organization, which comprises 8,000 people from the film industry and invites members to join based on their contributions to film. Governors include such luminaries as director Steven Spielberg and actors Tom Hanks, Laura Dern and Whoopi Goldberg.

Weinstein is a member of the executives’ branch of the academy and is also a member of the Producers Guild of America. The PGA board is to meet on Monday to discuss whether to begin disciplinary proceedings against Weinstein, who would have 15 days to respond to any decision by the board, including an expulsion.

While Weinstein has driven numerous films to success at the Academy Awards over two decades, he has only won one Oscar himself, for producing best picture winner “Shakespeare in Love” in 1999.

The fallout from the allegations has been swift for Weinstein. He was fired at the beginning of this week from The Weinstein Co, the independent studio he co-founded in 2005 with his brother Bob Weinstein.

A spokesman for The Weinstein Co, in an email, cited Bob Weinstein’s interview published on Saturday with The Hollywood Reporter, in which he said the academy should expel his brother. Bob Weinstein said he was aware of his brother’s marital infidelities, but said he had no idea about “the type of predator that he was,” according to the industry publication.

Hachette Book Group, the U.S. publishing house of French group Lagardere, terminated the Weinstein Books imprint on Thursday. People magazine reported on Tuesday that Weinstein’s wife, Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman, was leaving him.

France has started the process of stripping Weinstein of his Legion of Honor, France’s highest civilian distinction, President Emmanuel Macron’s office said on Saturday.

Berlin (Reuters) - Wenige Tage vor dem Start der Sondierungen einer Jamaika-Koalition aus Union, FDP und Grünen versuchen die Beteiligten Pflöcke einzuschlagen.

FDP-Chef Christian Linder knüpfte am Wochenende die Bildung einer schwarz-gelb-grünen Koalition an die Abschaffung des Solidaritäts-Zuschlags. Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir lehnt die von der Union verlangten Begrenzungen für den Flüchtlingszuzug ab. Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann (CSU) erhebt Anspruch auf ein Ministeramt in der künftigen Bundesregierung. Die FDP pocht darauf, das Finanzministerium zu besetzen.

Am Mittwoch starten die Sondierungen zunächst mit Zweiertreffen. Erst am Freitag kommen alle drei Parteien erstmals zu gemeinsamen Gesprächen zusammen. Gerechnet wird mit mehreren Sondierungsrunden bevor grünes Licht für Koalitionsverhandlungen gegeben werden könnte. Zuletzt haben sich FDP und Grüne skeptisch gezeigt, ob vor Weihnachten die Bildung einer neuen Bundesregierung gelingen könnte.

“Ein Jamaika-Steuerkonzept kann es nur geben, wenn es das Ende des Solidaritätszuschlages umfasst, ohne dass den Menschen das Geld an anderer Stelle wieder aus den Taschen gezogen wird”, sagte Lindner der “Bild am Sonntag” (BamS). Im “Spiegel” beanspruchte der stellvertretende Parteichef Wolfgang Kubicki das Amt des Finanzministers für seine Partei. Ersten Zugriff auf das Amt habe Lindner. Allerdings gibt es sowohl in der Union und auch bei den Grünen Stimmen, die das Finanzressort nicht den Freidemokraten überlassen wollen.

ÖZDEMIR RELATIVIERT UNIONS-FORDERUNG NACH OBERGRENZE

In der “Welt am Sonntag” (WamS) sagte Özdemir zur Forderung der Union, die Netto-Zuwanderung aus humanitären Gründen pro Jahr auf 200.000 Menschen zu begrenzen: “Es muss einen Kompromiss geben, in dem sich jedoch alle wiederfinden können.” Die Grünen lehnen Obergrenzen für Flüchtlinge entschieden ab. Özdemir warnte davor, sich bei dem Koalitionsverhandlungen nur auf den kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner zu einigen. “Das wird es nicht tragen.”

Der CSU-Politiker Herrmann erhob in der ”Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung“ den Anspruch auf einen Ministerposten. Dass er kein Bundestagsmandat habe, spreche dem nicht entgegen: ”Das ist sicherlich kein K.O.-Kriterium. In der WamS sprach sich die NRW-Heimatministerin Ina Schnarrenbach zudem dafür aus, auch auf Bundesebene ein Heimat-Ressort zu schaffen.

Zwischen Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel und Özdemir kam es zu einem Schlagabtausch in der Verkehrspolitik. Der Grünen-Chef wies Vorwürfe der Kanzlerin zurück, die Grünen seien eine Verbotspartei: “Ein Missverständnis der Bundeskanzlerin muss vor Beginn der Sondierungen ausgeräumt werden: Wir Grüne kämpfen entschlossen gegen die Fahrverbote, die wegen des Nichtstuns und der Ignoranz ihres bisherigen Verkehrsministers Alexander Dobrindt, Deutschlands unfähigsten Ministers, drohen.” Am Freitag hatte Merkel die Grünen als Verbotspartei attackiert. So sei von einem Verbot des Verbrennungsmotors die Rede und von Fahrverboten für Dieselfahrzeuge.

Vor Beginn der Gespräche über die Chancen für eine Jamaika-Koalition fiel die Union in einer Umfrage auf den tiefsten Stand seit sechs Jahren.

Instead, the focus is on Roshan Kalra, a chef who is fired from his job in an Indian restaurant after he punches a customer (something Saif Ali Khan was accused of doing in real life). Roshan returns home to India from New York to see his pre-teen son Armaan (Svar Kamble) and ex-wife Radha (Padmapriya), who live in a picturesque, old-world bungalow in Kochi. There, Roshan re-discovers his relationship with his son and with food.

When Biju (Milind Soman), Radha’s friend, offers him a chance to overhaul an old double-decker bus and start running a restaurant, he reluctantly takes up the offer. A former colleague from New York joins him, and it turns into one merry road trip across India, serving “fusion” Indian food along the way. Alas, this fusion food, like much else in the film, is boring. Take, for example, the “rotzaa”, or a pizza fashioned out of that staple Indian flatbread, the roti - something a thousand Indian restaurants have on their menus.

This “rotzaa” is symptomatic of the approach “Chef” takes – it makes no attempt transcend or improve on the original film. For someone with a Michelin star, Roshan seems to have just one kind of pasta dish and the “rotzaa” in his repertoire. The film is full of food clichés like “chhole bhature” from Delhi and “puttu” (steamed rice noodles) from Kerala, and full of relationship clichés like the father bonding with the son.

To their credit, Saif Ali Khan and debutant Svar Kamble are comfortable in their characters. But Roshan’s relationship with his ex-wife is handled haphazardly. Biju is first shown as a threat, then disappears completely, and Radha flits in and out of the screenplay like she isn’t sure how she fits.

The end plays out as you thought it would. The original “Chef” at least made a comment on the food cart phenomenon in the United States, but there is no such phenomenon in India. Neither the food nor the emotions in this remake satisfy.",Movie Review: Chef,https://in.reuters.com/article/chef-review-saif-ali-khan/movie-review-chef-idINKBN1CB16Y

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis canonised 35 new Roman Catholic saints on Sunday, including three indigenous children martyred in 16th century Mexico and considered the first Christians killed for their faith in the New World.

Francis used the occasion to announce that he had decided to call a meeting of bishops, or synod, from countries in the Pan-Amazon region for October, 2019, to discuss the condition of the Church in the area and the plight of indigenous people.

The region includes Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil.

The three children the pope canonised before a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square were of the Talaxcaltec people, an indigenous pre-Colombian group in what is now Mexico.

The first child, Cristoforo, was converted to Christianity by Franciscan missionaries and was killed in 1527 by his own father, a tribal chief who spurned his son’s attempts to convert him from paganism.

The boy was beaten and thrown into a fire when he was 13.

Two other indigenous children from the same area, Antonio and Juan, were killed by Indios in the village of Cuauhtinchan in 1529 as a result of their conversion. They are believed to have been 12 or 13 when they were beaten to death for helping Dominican missionaries.

The pope also canonised 30 martyrs who were killed for their faith in Brazil in 1645. They included two Portuguese missionaries and 28 followers killed by Dutch colonial soldiers during a period of persecution of Catholics.

In announcing the 2019 synod for bishops from the Amazon region, Francis said indigenous people there today were “often abandoned and without the prospect of a bright future, even due to the crisis of the Amazon Forest, a lung of utmost importance for our planet”.

Francis, an Argentine and the first Latin American pope, has often linked his calls for social justice, particularly for indigenous people, to those for defence of the environment, saying the poor will suffer the most from the effects of climate change.

In 2015 he wrote a landmark encyclical, or papal letter, on defence of the environment and he has called for special protection for the Amazon region because of its vital importance to the planet’s ecosystem.

In his comments on Sunday, the pope did not mention the role of the Church in suppressing native cultures in the New World.

But during a visit to Bolivia in 2015, Francis said “many grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God”. He asked forgiveness for the Church, for “crimes committed against native peoples during the so-called conquest of America”.

On Sunday, Francis also canonised Father Faustino Miguez, a Spanish priest who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, and Father Angelo d‘Acri, an Italian itinerant preacher who died in 1739 after serving in some of the most remote areas of mountainous southern Italy.","Pope canonises first New World martyrs, calls Amazon synod for 2019",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-pope-canonisation/pope-canonises-first-new-world-martyrs-calls-amazon-synod-for-2019-idUKKBN1CK0FI

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 11.0 percent from September 2016, while home prices were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the group’s home price index.

“National sales appear to be stabilizing,” CREA President Andrew Peck said in a statement. “While encouraging, it’s too early to tell if this is the beginning of a longer-term trend.”

Canada’s once-sizzling housing market has cooled dramatically in recent months, particularly in Toronto, the largest city, after a foreign buyers tax was announced in April, and analysts are divided over whether the market is in the midst of a full-scale correction or will bounce back quickly.

In addition to the implementation of a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and Toronto in 2017, two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada has helped rein in demand.

The report showed activity was up on the month in about half of all local markets, including Vancouver and Toronto. Cities around Toronto had mixed results, with activity remaining near record lows or falling further in some markets.

Sales were down from year-ago levels in nearly three-quarters of all local markets, led by Toronto and nearby housing markets.

The 10.7 percent year-over-year increase in CREA’s Home Price Index was a continued deceleration in annual price gains earlier in the year. The actual national average price for homes sold in September was up almost 3 percent from a year ago at C$487,000 ($390,537), CREA said.

Home resale prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August, separate reports showed on Thursday. [L2N1MN0KT]

The report showed the number of newly listed homes rebounded almost 5 percent in September from August, breaking a string of three straight declines.

The national sales-to-new listings ratio declined to 55.7 percent from 57.2 percent in August. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is generally consistent with a balanced market.

In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) faces an antitrust fine in Taiwan, the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in court over many of the same legal issues.

The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday it would fine Qualcomm T$23.4 billion ($774.14 million) for anti-trust violations of its chip technology.

The Commission said in a Chinese-language statement that Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players.

In Taiwan, Qualcomm is required to submit a progress report on the matter every six months to the Commission on negotiations with related parties.

In a statement, Qualcomm said it disagreed with the decision. Once the final decision is issued in the coming weeks, Qualcomm said it will challenge the decision in court.

“The fine bears no rational relationship to the amount of Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan, and Qualcomm will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” Qualcomm said.

The Taiwanese decision is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and also licensing a suite of patents related to how those chips are put into a phone to provide mobile data to the device. While the regulatory and legal attacks differ in some details, a key theme is the allegation that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the market for modem chips to charge unfair royalty rates for its patents.

Last December, Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed an $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

European regulators have also expressed antitrust concerns over Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O).

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also suing Qualcomm over its licensing practices.

Those regulatory challenges are playing out as Apple is waging a global legal battle on Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its patents.

After those lawsuits were filed, Qualcomm brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones.

Many trees on the forested hills of Balukhali in southern Bangladesh, where the incident took place, have been chopped down to house the massive influx of Rohingya Muslims escaping violence in neighboring Myanmar.

Tarpaulin and bamboo shelters have been built on elephant walkways in some areas, sparking environmental concerns, as the country struggles to accommodate an unprecedented number of people.

Besides those killed, four refugees from neighboring tents were injured and were in critical condition at Sadar Hospital in Cox’s Bazar, the town’s additional superintendent of police Afrujul Hoque Totul told Reuters.

At the refugee camp, cooking utensils the family had brought from Myanmar lay crushed under a jumble of bamboo sticks and clothes.

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian home resale prices in September staged their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices were flat in August in the once red-hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, adding to evidence that the country’s housing boom continued to cool, data showed on Thursday.

Prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, the first monthly decline since 2016 and the biggest since September 2010, according to the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes.

National price gains also slowed on an annual basis, with prices up 11.4 percent from last year, compared to an annual increase of 13.1 percent in August.

Two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada have helped rein in demand, and analysts are divided over whether the market will manage a soft landing or see a U.S. style housing crash.

Price increases of more than 30 percent in Toronto early in the year sparked fears of a housing bubble, and the provincial government slapped a 15 percent foreign buyers tax on purchases in the city to cool speculation.

A separate report from Statistics Canada showed new home prices, excluding apartments and condominiums, nationally rose 0.1 percent in August, shy of forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain.

Prices were unchanged in 15 out of 27 markets, including Vancouver and Toronto.

It was the third month in a row showing unchanged new home prices in Toronto, Canada’s largest city.

In the home resale market, Toronto led September’s price decline with a 2.7 percent monthly drop, according to Teranet.

“Many might worry about the fact that the last time we saw a string of monthly (Toronto) declines of such magnitude was during the last economic recession. They should not ... market conditions appear to have stabilized over the last four months,” National Bank Financial economist Marc Pinsonneault said in a note to clients.

“If that is the case, a large part of the price correction to be seen in the Toronto home resale market might be behind us,” he added.

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idINKBN1CK05Z?il=0

After weeks of seeing his agenda imperiled by Republican divisions and infighting among his aides, Trump has been a whirl of activity this week, reasserting his campaign priorities and trying to deliver wins for his fervent but frustrated base of supporters.

Trump took steps to dramatically undercut the Obamacare health system, sent notice he was willing to scuttle the nuclear deal with Iran, moved to roll back coal-plant limits, and again demanded a wall along the Mexican border.

And on social media the Republican president appeared to relish his feuds with the news media, senior Republicans in Congress, and National Football League players who have protested during the national anthem.

In a sense, it was the vintage, freewheeling Trump: throwing red meat to his voter base, following his gut, and haranguing his critics.

But by the end of the week, he had made more progress in undoing the policy accomplishments of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, than he had in some time.

“Trump knows he has to make good on several of his campaign promises,” said Ford O‘Connell, a Republican strategist. “The clock is ticking, Congress is useless and portions of his base are growing frustrated.”

At the same time, there is still chaos and uncertainty in the White House, so much so much so that Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, took the unusual step of telling reporters that he was not resigning. Meanwhile, the job status of his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, appears to remain tenuous.

The timing of some of Trump’s measures this week was driven by external deadlines, especially in the case of the Iran deal. And his administration has also been occupied by a spate of deadly hurricanes and the shooting spree in Las Vegas, which have hampered its ability to move forward on its policy agenda.

But Trump this week was also sending a clear message: that he plans on doing as much as he can without waiting for Congress to act.

“The president campaigned on a bold agenda, and Congress’s inaction won’t stop the administration’s tireless efforts to boost the economy, improve healthcare, and protect the American people,” said Raj Shah, the White House’s principal deputy press secretary.

When he sat in the Oval Office, Obama defiantly declared that he would circumvent a hostile Congress by using a “pen and a phone,” issuing executive orders where possible.

And when Trump ran for president last year, he frequently said that only he “alone” could fix the nation’s problems.

But once he took office, Trump attempted to follow the lead of Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he watched with dismay how little movement was made on priorities such as healthcare, immigration, and national security.

LESSONS FROM ALABAMA

Trump, too, remains bothered by another time he deferred to congressional Republicans and supported incumbent Senator Luther Strange in a divisive primary fight last month in Alabama.

Strange lost to Roy Moore, an archconservative backed by Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, with many of Trump’s core supporters voting for Moore.

The loss came after Trump alarmed some conservatives by saying he could cut deals with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to advance his agenda, particularly on providing relief from deportation for ”Dreamers” - immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.

That led to speculation that he was going to chart a more centrist course.

But there was little of that talk this week after the White House released a series of hard-line immigration proposals that stand to threaten any bipartisan deal. Pelosi called the proposals “trash.”

Trump, too, rejected the advice of Kelly, Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other aides in decertifying the Iran nuclear deal, according to two administration officials, intent on staying true to his fierce criticism of the deal during the campaign.

Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide to Trump, said Strange’s loss served as a reminder to Trump that he has to look after the interests of his political base.

“That was a big punch in the stomach,” Nunberg said, one that showed the president that “this is not a cult of personality. It’s about deliverables.”

Those deliverables are the fulfillment of the campaign promises that Bannon once featured on a whiteboard in his White House office, said Nunberg, who added that Bannon’s shadow “still hovers over the West Wing.”

Bannon has pledged to support primary challengers to Republican Senate incumbents in several states next year in a bid to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he blames for impeding Trump’s policy agenda.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week showed Trump’s approval slipping among the rural voters he so successfully courted in last year’s election.

In September, 47 percent of people in rural areas approved of Trump while 47 percent disapproved, the poll found. That was down from Trump’s first four weeks in office, when 55 percent said they approved of the president while 39 percent disapproved.

The poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.","In a sudden flurry, Trump looks to deliver for his voters",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-analysis/in-a-sudden-flurry-trump-looks-to-deliver-for-his-voters-idUSKBN1CI32X?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The S&P 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan and Citigroup showed on Thursday with results that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they’re at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns.

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each trade around 50 percent above their book value. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are neck-and-neck at some 1.3 times book, while laggards Bank of America and Citi trade at par.

Using the rule of thumb that big banks need to deliver 10 percent returns for their shareholders, JPMorgan’s valuation means it ought soon to be cranking out a 15 percent return on book equity. Yet the bank run by Jamie Dimon will only hit an ROE of 13.6 percent by 2020, according to estimates collated by Thomson Reuters. Across the first three quarters of 2017, it managed only an annualized 11 percent.

If President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress succeed in cutting corporate tax rates to, say, 25 percent from the current 35 percent headline rate that could, in theory, boost any tax-paying U.S. company’s net profit by 15 percent – turning JPMorgan’s sub-14 percent return into one above 15 percent. It’s a similar story at Citi. An ROE of just over 7 percent so far this year increasing to an estimated 8.7 percent in 2020 could get near 10 percent with lower taxes.

The trouble is, that wouldn’t just require difficult tax legislation. It also needs banks to dodge problems elsewhere. Sluggish loan growth is one. That’s especially true for large banks, where lending has grown just 1 percent this year, compared with 6 percent at smaller banks, according to the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan managed a 3 percent increase in the year to September - though core loans grew faster. Citi’s loan book expanded by 2 percent.

Loan defaults are rising, too. Citi has already warned of higher losses in its U.S. credit-card unit. Even share buybacks, which reduce book equity and share count thereby increasing ROE and earnings per share, offer less bang for the buck: bank stocks are over a third more expensive than on the eve of last November’s U.S. election.

There may be no obvious calamity ahead. But there are enough obstacles to slow U.S. bank bulls down.",Breakingviews - Wall Street bank owners too optimistic on taxes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-breakingviews/breakingviews-wall-street-bank-owners-too-optimistic-on-taxes-idUSKBN1CH2RK

“Mr. Priebus was voluntarily interviewed by Special Counsel Mueller’s team today,” said his lawyer, William Burck. “He was happy to answer all of their questions.”

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators are interviewing a number of White House and other officials as part of the inquiry into any ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.

Mueller’s inquiry includes whether Trump might have obstructed justice by trying to persuade then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser.

Flynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

Poloz also said that although the economy as a whole had bounced back, there were still areas of weakness. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the fall meeting of the International Monetary Fund.

The central bank raised interest rates in July and September after sitting on the sidelines for seven years and said further hikes would depend heavily on data.

Gross domestic product grew at an annualized 4.5 percent in the second quarter but recent economic releases, in particular the monthly statistics for trade, have largely been disappointing.

“There obviously will be a moderation of growth in the second half of the year ... that’s what every economy does when it approaches full capacity, it slows down to its sustainable level,” said Poloz.

Asked whether he had any particular concerns about slowing growth, he replied: “Not to share with you today.” The bank is due to release its next set of economic forecasts on Oct. 25.

In July, the bank forecast that annualized quarterly economic growth would drop to 2.0 percent in the third quarter.

Poloz said that while the economy had largely recovered from the oil shock, there remained areas which needed adjustments.

“We’re still an economy with our head in the oven and our feet in the freezer. So for the people with their feet in the freezer, that doesn’t resonate with them if you say everything’s on track,” he said.

The central bank has identified a number of potential risks, including the potential for disruption if talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement collapse.

“The shock on the economy we would expect to be a negative one because it would cause a rethink of investment plans,” he said, adding that the bank would wait to see what happened before deciding how to react.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Taliban spokesman denied on Sunday accusations by a Canadian man that one of his children had been murdered and his wife raped while they were being held captive by militants who kidnapped them in Afghanistan in 2012.

Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were held by the Haqqani network, a semi-independent wing of the Afghan Taliban, before being rescued by Pakistani troops in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghan border, last week.

Boyle told reporters soon after he, his wife and their three children returned to Canada on Friday that their captors had murdered a fourth child had raped his wife.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that as propaganda by the Western governments that helped rescue the family.

“We strongly reject these fake and fabricated allegations of this Canadian family, now in the hands of the enemy,” he said in a statement sent to media.‎

“Whatever statement the enemy wants to put in their mouth, the family is forced to make it.”

Boyle called on the Taliban to “provide my family with the justice we deserve”.

Mujahid said the couple was intentionally never separated in order to protect their safety.

He also denied that their child had been murdered, but acknowledged that one child became sick and died.

“We were in a remote areas without access to a doctor and medications that led the loss of the child,” he said.

Three children, all born in captivity, were rescued along with Boyle and Coleman.

The U.S. government calls the Haqqani network “the most lethal and sophisticated insurgent group” in Afghanistan.

Its operational chief, Sirajuddin Haqqani, was named deputy to the Taliban’s newly appointed leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in 2015, cementing the ties between the groups.

The Haqqanis previously held U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed in a swap for Taliban prisoners in 2014, and are suspected of holding two professors, an American and an Australian, who were kidnapped outside their university in Kabul in 2016.

A senior Afghan government official told Reuters that American and Afghan special forces launched two unsuccessful raids to try to rescue the professors in Afghanistan, but officials now believe the pair has been taken to Haqqani hideouts over the border in Pakistan.","Afghan Taliban deny former hostage's claims of murder, rape",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CK09T-OCADN

To secure a coalition agreement, the unlikely bedfellows must overcome differences on a range of issues including immigration policy, Europe, tax and the environment.

The CDU and CSU have reached an agreement over immigration policy, but it is not clear whether it will pass muster in a full coalition.

Following are remarks on the possible coalition from senior officials:

PROSPECTS FOR A JAMAICA COALITION:

ANGELA MERKEL (CDU)

“We achieved a joint result (with the Bavarian CSU allies) which I think is a very, very good basis to go into exploratory talks with the FDP and Greens.”

“On Friday, October 20th, we will have a first round of exploratory talks with all partners.”

“The parties come from very different starting positions. There will be discussions in a lot of policy areas with the FDP and the Greens.”

“We know that unusual combinations can, of course, bring the opportunity to find some solutions to things that had seemed unsolvable until now. So now we need to put our noses to the grindstone and see what we can do.”

THOMAS DE MAIZIERE (CDU)

“We’d be well advised not to be perfectionists in the upcoming coalition negotiations but rather to be open and to build trust that a government will be formed that acts sensibly, even during unforeseeable crises.”

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“Thoroughness is certainly more important than speed, but I‘m optimistic that everything will be sorted out by Christmas. All four parties are showing goodwill and the will of the voters is clear too: ‘Jamaica’ should be formed.”

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“We all need to just get started now.”

“Compromises always mean everyone needs to give a bit.”

“If the coalition comes off, it must not be a coalition that only agrees on the lowest common denominator. That won’t work.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“We don’t have to govern. There is also the possibility of another grand coalition (between Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats).”

WOLFGANG KUBICKI (FDP)

“It can succeed. The most important thing is that trust needs to be built between participants, and that takes time. That’s why it would be illusory to believe we could conclude negotiations by Christmas.”

IMMIGRATION:

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“No one would understand it if the new government does not pass an immigration law.”

“We need a mix of humanity and order. We Greens also want to secure the EU’s external borders and build a sensible database of fingerprints.”

“There must be a compromise that nonetheless represents everyone.”

SIMONE PETER (GREENS)

“This is an agreement between the CDU and CSU, and far from the result of exploratory talks for a coalition with the FDP and Greens.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“Immigration is not the only issue where the parties have different ideas.”

WOLFGANG KUBICKI (FDP)

“I am certain that, in the end, the solution that the CDU/CSU have found with each other will not be the basis for common work (with us) for the next four years.”

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“No party can expect the others to accept its original wording without changes ... But I believe that a signal about limiting immigration on humanitarian grounds will ultimately make its way into the coalition agreement.”

EURO ZONE FISCAL POLICY:

SIMONE PETER (GREENS)

“Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“A red line for us in coalition talks is the mutualization of debt in Europe, the creation of new pots of money.”

ENVIRONMENT:

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“What we Christian Democrats call ‘preservation of Creation’ overlaps a lot with what the Greens call a sustainable approach to nature.”

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“A misunderstanding on the part of the chancellor must be cleared up before the exploratory talks begin: We Greens are resolutely against the driving bans of which there is a risk due to the lack of action and ignorance of her Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, Germany’s most incompetent minister.”

TAX:

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“There can only be a Jamaica tax concept if it includes the end of the solidarity surcharge without taking that money out of people’s pockets somewhere else.”",FACTBOX - German coalition watch: Agreeing on lowest common denominator not enough - Greens,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-coalition-factbox/factbox-german-coalition-watch-agreeing-on-lowest-common-denominator-not-enough-greens-idUSKBN1CK0HB?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond on Sunday faced mounting questions over his future weeks ahead of a budget announcement, finding himself at the center of an increasingly fraught debate over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The EU last week declared a “disturbing deadlock” in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on arrangements to leave the bloc, raising the chances of Britain quitting without a negotiated deal and increasing criticism of the government’s handling of Brexit.

On Sunday an unnamed source from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said May must warn Hammond he faces the sack unless he changes his approach to Brexit, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The DUP is a small Northern Irish political party which is keeping May’s minority government in power.

“We are very concerned about Philip Hammond’s behavior,” the senior parliamentary DUP source told the newspaper.

“It is evident to us that he is winding people up and causing unnecessary division within the Conservative Party at a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations.”

A DUP spokesman later said the party did not recognize the “inaccurate” comments.

Hammond, 61, who is seen by many as May’s most pro-EU minister, has become a focal point of criticism for Brexiteers, who say he is overly pessimistic about the impact of leaving the bloc and is damaging Britain’s negotiating stance.

Last week Hammond warned that Brexit was causing a “cloud of uncertainty” over the British economy that needed to be cleared as quickly as possible. He has previously angered eurosceptics by calling for a lengthy transition out of the EU, during which there will be little change to rules on issues like immigration.

In a botched attempt on Friday to calm speculation over his future and play down the party’s divisions Hammond described the EU as the “enemy” in negotiations. He later said he regretted his choice of words.

He had been expected to lose his job if May had won an increased majority at a June snap election, but the vote instead saw the Conservatives lose their majority and Hammond retain his position as May fought to maintain unity between pro-EU and pro-Brexit factions.

The June election also transformed the DUP, which only has 10 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament, into an influential voice. May struck a deal with the party and is reliant on their support to pass legislation.

The delicate parliamentary arithmetic also means May faces criticism from lawmakers, including several from within her own party, who disagree with May’s threat to walk away from EU negotiations without a deal unless Brussels agrees fair terms.

The opposition Labour Party’s finance policy chief warned on Sunday that with the support on rebels from May’s party, parliament would block any attempt to leave the EU without a negotiated agreement.

REVOLUTIONARY BUDGET

Questions over the future of one of May’s most senior ministers come as he is due to present a budget plan on Nov. 22 which will see Britain through one of its most uncertain periods in decades, amid growing business concern and voter unrest.

The Sunday Times reported that Hammond was preparing a “revolutionary” budget that could see the government ditch its opposition to borrowing more to boost investment, and may include tax breaks for the young paid for by pensioners.

”The view has galvanized that this budget has got to be big, it’s got to be powerful, it’s got to be revolutionary. Saying it’s got to be brave is really understating it. People are very clear that this is basically the last chance,” the paper reported a senior government source as saying.

Hammond has limited room to increase public spending without pushing up Britain’s still high borrowing levels.

The country’s budget forecasters have signaled they are about to turn more gloomy about growth forecasts, meaning less tax revenue to fund Hammond’s war-chest to help the economy weather the process of leaving the EU in the coming years.

But he is already under pressure now to relax his grip on spending to counter the left-wing opposition Labour Party whose promises of more spending and higher taxes on the wealthy won over large numbers of voters in the June election.

At the same time, Hammond must not alarm investors who fund a budget shortfall which is expected to grow this year.

The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States.","With the fate of the Iran nuclear deal at stake, Donald Trump has until October 15 to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is complying with the seven-nation agreement. Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

Atwood’s dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale”, first published in 1985, has shot back up the bestseller lists after being made into an award-winning TV series depicting a totalitarian future in a United States where women are forced into sexual servitude.

Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president has, for some critics, brought that vision closer to reality as he uses social media to browbeat opponents, and lawmakers in a number of states seek to restrict women’s reproductive rights.

“It feels the closest to the 1930s of anything that we have had since that time,” the 77-year-old Atwood told a news conference, drawing parallels with the fascist and communist regimes which then ruled parts of Europe.

Atwood was attending the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, where she receives the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade on Sunday. The award citation praises Atwood’s “political awareness and alertness for developments beneath the surface”.

Past winners include Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, American writer and film-maker Susan Sontag and Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian-born writer and politician.

It’s a far cry from the Berlin of the Cold War, still surrounded by the wall that divided Germany, where she started writing The Handmaid’s Tale, she recalled.

“People in Europe saw the United States as a beacon of democracy, freedom, openness, and they did not want to believe that anything like that could ever happen there,” she said.

“But now, times have changed, and, unfortunately it becomes more possible to think in those terms.”

Although work on the TV series starring Elisabeth Moss began before last November’s U.S. presidential election, Trump’s victory changed the setting “quite radically”, said Atwood.

“That is one of the reasons that the show has been so popular ... people suddenly feel that it’s a possible reality for them,” she said.

Equifax, which disclosed last month that cyber criminals breached its systems between mid-May and late July and made off with sensitive data on 145.5 million people, said on Thursday it shut down one of its website pages after discovering that a third-party vendor was running malicious code on the page.

“The IRS notified us that they have issued a stop-work order under our Transaction Support for Identity Management contract,” an Equifax spokesperson said on Friday.

“We remain confident that we are the best party to perform the services required in this contract,” the spokesperson said. “We are engaging IRS officials to review the facts and clarify available options.”

The IRS is the first organization to say publicly that it is suspending a contract with Equifax since the credit reporting agency’s security problems came to light.

Atlanta-based Equifax said its systems were not compromised by the incident on Thursday, which involved bogus pop-up windows on the web page that could trick visitors into installing software that automatically displays advertising material.

Still, the IRS said it decided to temporarily suspended its short-term contract with Equifax for identity-proofing services.

“During this suspension, the IRS will continue its review of Equifax systems and security,” the agency said in a statement. There was no indication that any of the IRS data shared with Equifax under the contract had been compromised, it added.

The move means that the IRS will temporarily be unable to create new accounts for taxpayers using its Secure Access portal, which supports applications including online accounts and transcripts. Users who already had Secure Access accounts will not be affected, the IRS said.

IRS granted the $7.25 million contract to Equifax on Sept. 29, weeks after Equifax disclosed the massive data hack that drew scathing criticism from several lawmakers.

“From its initial announcement, the timing and nature of this IRS-Equifax contract raised some serious red flags ... we are pleased to see the IRS suspend its contract with Equifax,” Republican Representatives Greg Walden and Robert Latta said in a joint statement on Friday.

“Our focus now remains on protecting consumers and getting answers for the 145 million Americans impacted by this massive breach,” they said.

Government contracts in areas such as healthcare, law enforcement, social services, and tax and revenue, are major sources of revenue for Equifax.

In 2016, government services made up 5 percent of Equifax’s overall $3.1 billion in revenue, accounting for 10 percent of its workforce solutions revenues, 3 percent of its U.S. information solutions revenues, and 7 percent of its international revenues, according to a regulatory financial filing.",IRS puts Equifax contract on hold during security review,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CI2G9-OCATC

Sometimes his political messages were blunt, like when he pleaded before the U.S. Congress for Americans to end ""hostility"" toward immigrants. Other times, they were more subtle, like the climate-conscious pope's decision to ride around in a tiny Fiat rather than a gas-guzzling SUV.

While Vatican officials said the pope was only re-stating Church social teachings and not making political statements in his first U.S. visit ever, many in the public and across the political landscape saw it differently.

Aligning private investment with state priorities could grease the bureaucratic skids for some companies, but more official meddling in board rooms is unlikely to produce good business decisions. Opaque party politics will confuse outside investors and blur the line between some state and private companies.

The private sector creates most of China’s jobs, generates the bulk of its GDP and is by far the most efficient user of labor and capital. China’s economic growth miracle has occurred largely thanks to the ability of private companies to generate profit despite a shaky legal environment, entrenched official corruption and constant regulatory meddling. Yet despite the country’s recent economic recovery, private investment is in a prolonged funk. It notched up 6.4 percent growth in the year to August, in part due to a rebound in manufacturing and local government investment. That’s better than the dismal performance of last year, but still well off the 15 percent-plus growth rates of recent years. The softness could in turn sap long-term growth: the IMF reckons private firms generate around 7-8 percentage points higher return on assets than their state-owned peers, but investment by the latter has far outpaced the former in the last two years.

Officials recognize the risk. Despite the broader economic rally underway, private investment has never truly recovered from the downturn in late 2015. This year’s revival depended in no small part on fiscal stimulus, a real estate rally and high commodity prices, all of which disproportionately benefit the state-owned enterprises that dominate China’s heavy industry. If those areas come under pressure, private capital will be vital to maintain high growth. Thus the state is trying to re-inspire entrepreneurs with rhetorical blandishments. On Sept. 25, officials unveiled guidance to foster “the entrepreneurial spirit”; some think boosting the private sector might even feature as a theme at the 19th Party Congress next week.

Mixed messages

The government has already put some money where its mouth is. The central bank said it would slash reserve requirements for banks in order to boost credit to smaller companies, which some analysts estimate could add up to $150 billion of long-term liquidity. Premier Li Keqiang continues his drive to reduce fees, taxes and red tape that cut into profit margins. New areas of the economy have slowly and fitfully been opened to private investors. Partly as a result, China advanced to 78th place in the World Bank’s “ease of doing business” index this year, up from 93 a decade ago.

The trouble is, nearly everything else Xi is doing suggests a deep-rooted distrust of powerful private firms. Even as officials talk of getting SOEs to withdraw from non-strategic industries – the state still dominates beer and cigarette sectors – the government is inserting itself into businesses by other means. Officials have noticeably expanded their influence at large private firms, including multinationals, by inserting party committees into their governance structures. Executives sometimes feel compelled to participate in political projects such as the Xiong’an New Area and the Belt and Road Initiative. Bureaucrats have also rolled out “guidance funds” to buy stakes in priority industries and promote “mixed ownership” investments into state companies, occasionally using private capital. In certain cases that has translated into technology giants like Alibaba being more or less dragged into partnerships with state-owned firms like China Unicom.

It may yet go further. On Thursday the Wall Street Journal quoted sources saying internet regulators were discussing taking 1 percent stakes in Tencent, Weibo and Youku Tudou. The government is cracking down on overseas investments by private firms that it deems ill-advised. Deals by conglomerates including Dalian Wanda, HNA, the Fosun Group and Anbang Insurance have come in for particular scrutiny. Even the “entrepreneurial spirit” policy guidance contained a bizarre call for greater party discipline. The next generation of outbound investors could look more like CEFC China Energy, a mysterious privately held firm with policy bank backing that is currently executing a $9.1 billion strategic investment in Russia’s Rosneft.

Investors should expect this divergence to continue into Xi’s second term. On paper, firms will likely face somewhat less red tape and doing business will become genuinely easier. Behind the scenes, however, the invisible hand of the party may extend its grip at the largest companies. Party politics, even at their most benign, are a distraction at best for senior management. But if officials continue to take a more active role in corporate decision-making, the famously efficient Chinese private sector could start looking a lot more like its wasteful state-owned counterpart.",Breakingviews - Communist Party assault muddles Chinese capitalism,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-communist-party-assault-muddles-chinese-capitalism-idUSKBN1CI2NB

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Nigeria and South Africa are expected to lift sub-Saharan regional growth next year, a Reuters poll showed, once their central banks cut rates to boost Africa’s largest - but sickly - economies.

The two economies contribute more than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product and the poll taken in the past three days showed Nigeria’s economy, Africa’s biggest, will grow 2.4 percent in 2018, up from 0.8 percent this year. It has been in recession since late 2015.

South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized economy, is expected to grow 1.2 percent in 2018 compared to 0.7 percent this year.

Economists suggested both countries will probably wait until January or March to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent in South Africa and by the same margin to 13.75 percent in Nigeria.

“South Africa and Nigeria are the region’s largest two economies and, at present, the largest drawback on the SSA growth performance,” said Christie Viljoen, economist at KPMG.

Viljoen added improved growth in these two economies would help sub-Saharan Africa accelerate next year.

Africa’s two biggest economies emerged from recession in the second quarter but strong growth won’t return until business confidence is restored.

Nigeria has suffered from dollar shortages and falling commodity prices that have affected the continent’s major crude exporters, while South Africa has been dogged by political uncertainty.

Thea Fourie, senior economist at IHS Markit said the synchronized developed market recovery is also expected to support sub-Saharan Africa’s growth rate into next year.

Still, the World Bank on Wednesday said the economy of sub-Saharan Africa is seen growing more slowly this year than previously forecast, largely due to weak investment and productivity.

Fourie added growth is unlikely to reach levels witnessed during the commodity price super cycle, a period in the early 2000‘s.

She listed stronger foreign direct investment, higher government revenues and more inclusive growth as needed to place the region on a stronger path moving forward.

The survey also suggested Ethiopia and Ghana would lead growth in the region, with Ghana growing 6.6 percent next year from 6.3 percent this year, way better than the continent’s biggest economies.

Ethiopia’s economy is one of the fastest growing in Africa, with the IMF expecting a growth rate of 9 percent for the 2016/17 fiscal year.

The IMF’s earlier outlook for the sub-Sahara region suggests 2017 growth of 2.6 percent - around a full percentage below that for the world as a whole and less than half the 1999-2008 average of 5.6 percent.

Africa’s major central banks are in an easing cycle to stimulate economies. Ghana is likely to cut the most with rates, currently at 21 percent, seen ending next year at 17 percent.

South Africa will probably hold rates after cutting in the first quarter of next year while Nigeria’s will probably end next year at 12.25 percent, down from the current 14.0 percent.",Sub-Saharan Africa economic growth to pick-up next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CI0NO-OZABS

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova won her first WTA title in more than two years at the Tianjin Open on Sunday, showing plenty of grit and determination as she came from behind in each set to beat Belarusian teenager Aryna Sabalenka 7-5 7-6(8).

The former world number one, who returned to the tour in April following a 15-month doping ban, started the stronger, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game, but struggled on serve and soon found herself trailing 4-1 in the first set.

The Russian managed to hold serve for the first time in the match at 4-2 and clung on grimly in the face of some hard hitting by her 19-year-old opponent before converting her fourth break point of the next game to get back on serve at 4-3.

Her nerves settled, Sharapova began to hit her stride, breaking Sabalenka again to go 6-5 up before closing out the set.

The Belarusian, playing her first WTA final, came back in the second set, opening up a 5-1 lead before serving to send the match into a decider, but Sharapova once again fought back to erase the deficit.

The 30-year-old broke Sabalenka twice in succession and held her nerve when facing a set point on serve at 5-4 to level things up, and broke the Belarusian to give herself the chance to serve out the match at 6-5.

But there was more drama to come. The Russian, who sent down seven aces during the contest, double faulted when facing a break point to gift Sabalenka the game and send the set into a tiebreak.

Sharapova, whose last title came at the Italian Open in May 2015, had three match points but Sabalenka survived them all before double faulting with the score at 8-8 to hand Sharapova another opportunity.

The Swiss world number two beat Nadal in the finals of the Australian Open and Miami Masters and in the last 16 at Indian Wells earlier this year, and never looked like losing to his long-time rival in Shanghai, firing 10 aces as he cruised to victory.

”It’s a wonderful moment for me to be back here playing against my good friend and rival, Rafa... We didn’t think maybe we were going to have the year we did.

“I definitely didn‘t, so it’s just nice to share this court with you today and hopefully there’s more to come in the tournaments we’ve got left. It’s been a pleasure playing against you again today.”

Playing under a closed roof at the Qi Zhong Tennis Center, Federer sprinted out of the blocks, breaking Nadal in the opening game and the Spaniard had little answer to the sheer variety of shots coming across the net.

The Swiss refused to take his foot off the pedal in the second set, breaking Nadal to go 3-2 up and keeping his cool to wrap up victory.

He sealed the win on his opponent’s serve, winning the second of three match points to claim his 94th career title.

Federer, who won the tournament in 2014, has enjoyed himself on the fast courts of Shanghai this year, while Nadal will look back on a successful stint in Asia after winning last week’s China Open.

“I want to congratulate Roger and his team for a great year. Today I think you played a fantastic match, so many congratulations,” Nadal said.

“This year has probably been the most successful of my career here in China... It’s been a great two weeks and I feel very happy after a long year to be able to have the results here.

(Reuters) - Luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fired about 400 employees this week, including associates, team leaders and supervisors, a former employee told Reuters on Friday.

The dismissals were a result of a company-wide annual review, Tesla said in an emailed statement, without confirming the number of employees leaving the company.

“It’s about 400 people ranging from associates to team leaders to supervisors. We don’t know how high up it went,” said the former employee, who worked on the assembly line and did not want to be identified.

Though Tesla cited performance as the reason for the firings, the source told Reuters he was fired in spite of never having been given a bad review.

The Palo Alto, California-based company said earlier in the month that “production bottlenecks” had left Tesla behind its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan.

The company delivered 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 during the third quarter. In July, it began production of the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 - half the starting price of the Model S.

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

Prime Minister May, brave as she is to shoulder the task, may not be up to it. Foreign Secretary Johnson careless as he is with both the truth and his loyalty, may be. Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Sunday called for calm less than 24 hours ahead of a deadline from Spain’s central government for him to clarify whether he has declared independence for Catalonia or not.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has not been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Sunday that if article 155 was invoked, the government would replace the Catalan government with a new set-up to manage the region autonomously, which could be run by politicians or technocrats. Within three months, elections would be held.",Catalan leader calls for calm ahead of Madrid deadline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/catalan-leader-calls-for-calm-ahead-of-madrid-deadline-idUSKBN1CK0J3

TORONTO (Reuters) - A key attorney executing BlackBerry Ltd’s patent licensing strategy has left the company, the second recent departure from the team tasked with making money from the Canadian company’s intellectual property.

Victor Schubert, who was a licensing director for BlackBerry, told Reuters in a brief LinkedIn message that he was no longer with the company. He did not say when he left or why.

Monetizing the company’s intellectual property is a key part of Chief Executive John Chen’s plan for turning around the company whose revenues have declined for six straight years as sales of its once ubiquitous smartphones have tumbled.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment on Schubert. Two switchboard operators at the Canadian company said his name was not in a global employee directory.

News of his exit follows the recent departure of Mark Kokes, who lead BlackBerry’s overall patent strategy. Kokes last month joined a health technology company.

Schubert joined BlackBerry in March 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile, as the company was embarking on a major push to boost licensing revenue.

BlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of some 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications.

Schubert has created and executed patent-licensing programs for at least four companies, including BlackBerry, dating back to 1992, according to his LinkedIn profile. It lists portfolio mining, patent valuation and negotiating patent sales as areas of expertise.

He was due to represent BlackBerry at a Seattle-area patent conference next month to discuss how operating companies can make money off their intellectual property, according to an agenda posted on the conference website in August. He is no longer listed as a panelist.

BlackBerry disclosed it had secured royalty-bearing deals with Cisco Systems Inc and another company that it did not name soon after Schubert joined. It also filed patent infringement lawsuits during his tenure against Nokia and Avaya Inc [AVXX.UL] that are ongoing.

BlackBerry on Thursday disclosed that it had settled another lawsuit, filed against low-end Android phone manufacturer BLU Products Inc.

Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate who lost out to Trump in last November’s election, also said Britain would face serious disruption if it left the EU without a negotiated deal with Brussels.

The British government has talked up the prospect of bilateral trade deals with the United States and others as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU following last year’s surprise referendum vote to leave.

Asked about the prospects of a British-U.S. deal, Clinton told the BBC: “You’re making a trade deal with somebody who says he doesn’t believe in trade, so I‘m not quite sure how that’s going to play out over the next few years.”

Clinton also said Britain would be at a “very big disadvantage” if divorce negotiations with the EU failed, and went on to compare the factors behind the Brexit vote to her own election loss.

“Looking at the Brexit vote now it was a precursor to some extent to what happened to us in the United States... The amount of fabricated, false information that your voters were given by the ‘Leave’ campaign,” she said.

She said her own presidential campaign was subject to similar treatment, citing the spread of false stories by online news outlets, and warned that Britain and other countries must be alert to the risks of such new media.

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank Group is aiming to develop new measures to enhance its financial capacity and have its board decide on them at its next spring meetings in April 2018, a spokesman for the institution said on Saturday.

The World Bank has been seeking a general capital increase for its IBRD lending arm for two years, but the Trump administration has been reluctant to support it.

A U.S. Treasury official told Reuters earlier this week that it was too soon to consider such an increase and the World Bank needed to review its balance sheet and shift resources away from higher-income emerging markets such as China toward countries with greater needs.

The bank had originally set a goal of its shareholders deciding on a capital increase at this week’s World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings. In a communique issued on Saturday, the World Bank and IMF joint development committee directed the institution to look at any and all options.

“We ask the Board and Management to review all possible options to enhance the World Bank Group’s financial capacity and develop a package of measures, including internal levers and general and selective capital increases, for Governors’ consideration, with the aim of reaching a decision at the 2018 Spring Meetings,” the committee said.

The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.

Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.

Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.

The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.

Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.

Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”

“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”

An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.

DISRUPTIVE

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.

Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.

Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.

Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.

Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.

On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.

Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.

DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR

Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.

“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side's arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber's product was ""dissimilar"" from Waymo's.

Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.

Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.

The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”",Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-uber-lawsuit/exclusive-alphabets-waymo-demanded-1-billion-in-settlement-talks-with-uber-sources-idUSKBN1CH0QC

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The battle for the city of Raqqa, which Islamic State had used as its headquarters in Syria, is drawing to an end.

Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic “caliphate” Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries.

Following are some facts about Raqqa:

THE CITY

Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.

Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.

THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.

The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.

ITS PEOPLE

The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians.

The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.

Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.

Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.

Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.

The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.

Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa’s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule.

AFTER THE FIGHTING

The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.

The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border.

The SDF’s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured.

The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.

Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.

Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.

HERITAGE

A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point.

It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund members gave lukewarm endorsement to a strengthening global economy but conceded they were not out of the woods as they grappled with subdued inflation, low potential growth and an uneven recovery that clouded the outlook.

With central banks left with less firepower and some seeking to exit crisis-mode stimulus measures, the IMF members also renewed calls for fiscal policy and structural reforms to carry more of the burden in solidifying the recovery, now that the worst days of the economic storm had passed.

“Structural reforms that were difficult to do in hard times would be much easier in better times because the outlook is stronger,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Saturday.

“It’s when the sun is shining that you need to fix the roof. That message was received 100 percent (by the policymakers).”

A communique from the IMF’s steering body, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), said a global economic upswing, driven by a pickup in investment, trade and factory output, was brightening the outlook.

But it warned policymakers against complacency, saying that the recovery was “not yet complete” with inflation below target and potential growth weak in many countries.

Financial leaders attending the meeting also warned that while economies had improved in many countries there were people who had been left behind.

“We’re still an economy with our head in the oven and our feet in the freezer. So for the people with their feet in the freezer, that doesn’t resonate with them if you say everything’s on track,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.

PATIENCE NEEDED

The optimism on global growth was overshadowed by tensions on trade, which was in full show in contentious talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) held during the IMF’s autumn meetings.

The communique made no mention of trade, though Lagarde sought to offer a bright note by saying it was “perfectly legitimate” to renew long-standing trade agreements to respond to a changing world.

“Trade is a very powerful engine of growth, innovation, competition and productivity ... Hopefully if it is well done, it can be a win-win for all countries in those negotiations,” she said, when asked about the NAFTA talks.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The communique said member countries agreed to work together to reduce “excessive global imbalances,” and to look more carefully at potential side-effects that prolonged low interest rates could have on asset prices and economic activity.

Policymakers also had less to cheer on inflation and wages, which remain weak despite a strengthening recovery that prompted the IMF to upgrade its global growth forecast.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that while subdued price and wage growth has become a common phenomenon in advanced economies, it was ”only a question of time“ for them to accelerate as the economy gathers momentum.”

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said the key was patience.

“The bottom line in terms of policy is that we are confident that as the conditions will continue to improve, the inflation rate will gradually converge in a self-sustained manner,” he said.

“But together with our confidence, we should also be patient because it’s going to take time.”",Global policymakers grapple with half-baked recovery short of wage growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-imf-g20/global-policymakers-grapple-with-half-baked-recovery-short-of-wage-growth-idUKKBN1CJ0R2

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg. Mark Zuckerberg’s right-hand woman on Thursday deftly fielded questions about Russia-backed ads and the social network’s broader role in society. It was a notable contrast to the bumbling way her boss handles the limelight, especially since the $500 billion company has come under greater scrutiny.

Sandberg traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. legislators about the bombshell findings that Facebook ran more than 3,000 political ads placed by fake agencies with alleged ties to the Kremlin. The agitprop was designed to sway the U.S. presidential election last year. During an interview with news website Axios, Sandberg said the company is working with investigators to help make the trove public.

Although she parried certain sensitive questions about how much Facebook knew, Sandberg conveyed that it is troubled by the abuse on the system. She also made clear that divisive information would continue to be a part of its powerful newsfeed. If legitimate organizations had purchased many of the same ads, they would have run.

The chief operating officer’s polish was a welcome display, especially after Zuckerberg’s knee-jerk reaction – followed much later by an apology – that it was crazy to think misinformation spread on Facebook might have affected the presidential vote. More broadly, Sandberg has been less visible on important public debates roiling the increasingly influential company.

For example, Zuckerberg initially took the lead explaining how Facebook planned to be more open about political advertising and to work with legislators. Speaking on a live online stream dressed in a T-shirt gave a casual air that undercut the important message. Another botched video showed him breezily using virtual reality to visit devastated Puerto Rico. The Facebook founder’s nationwide listening tour also has been clumsy and led to growing speculation that he aspires to public office.

Either way, he’s not faring especially well with this phase of 13-year-old Facebook. The intensity only will grow as U.S. and European authorities dig into how the company uses data to target advertising. Zuckerberg was smart enough to hire Sandberg from Google in 2008, back when only 66 million people were on Facebook and the company was still privately owned and valued at just $15 billion. It may be time to give her an even bigger role.",Breakingviews - Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-politics-breakingviews/breakingviews-facebook-could-do-with-more-sheryl-sandberg-idUSKBN1CH2VP

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond on Sunday faced mounting questions over his future weeks ahead of a budget announcement, finding himself at the center of an increasingly fraught debate over Britain’s departure from the European Union.

The EU last week declared a “disturbing deadlock” in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on arrangements to leave the bloc, raising the chances of Britain quitting without a negotiated deal and increasing criticism of the government’s handling of Brexit.

On Sunday an unnamed source from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said May must warn Hammond he faces the sack unless he changes his approach to Brexit, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The DUP is a small Northern Irish political party which is keeping May’s minority government in power.

“We are very concerned about Philip Hammond’s behavior,” the senior parliamentary DUP source told the newspaper.

“It is evident to us that he is winding people up and causing unnecessary division within the Conservative Party at a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations.”

A DUP spokesman later said the party did not recognize the “inaccurate” comments.

Hammond, 61, who is seen by many as May’s most pro-EU minister, has become a focal point of criticism for Brexiteers, who say he is overly pessimistic about the impact of leaving the bloc and is damaging Britain’s negotiating stance.

Last week Hammond warned that Brexit was causing a “cloud of uncertainty” over the British economy that needed to be cleared as quickly as possible. He has previously angered eurosceptics by calling for a lengthy transition out of the EU, during which there will be little change to rules on issues like immigration.

In a botched attempt on Friday to calm speculation over his future and play down the party’s divisions Hammond described the EU as the “enemy” in negotiations. He later said he regretted his choice of words.

He had been expected to lose his job if May had won an increased majority at a June snap election, but the vote instead saw the Conservatives lose their majority and Hammond retain his position as May fought to maintain unity between pro-EU and pro-Brexit factions.

The June election also transformed the DUP, which only has 10 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament, into an influential voice. May struck a deal with the party and is reliant on their support to pass legislation.

The delicate parliamentary arithmetic also means May faces criticism from lawmakers, including several from within her own party, who disagree with May’s threat to walk away from EU negotiations without a deal unless Brussels agrees fair terms.

The opposition Labour Party’s finance policy chief warned on Sunday that with the support on rebels from May’s party, parliament would block any attempt to leave the EU without a negotiated agreement.

REVOLUTIONARY BUDGET

Questions over the future of one of May’s most senior ministers come as he is due to present a budget plan on Nov. 22 which will see Britain through one of its most uncertain periods in decades, amid growing business concern and voter unrest.

The Sunday Times reported that Hammond was preparing a “revolutionary” budget that could see the government ditch its opposition to borrowing more to boost investment, and may include tax breaks for the young paid for by pensioners.

”The view has galvanized that this budget has got to be big, it’s got to be powerful, it’s got to be revolutionary. Saying it’s got to be brave is really understating it. People are very clear that this is basically the last chance,” the paper reported a senior government source as saying.

Hammond has limited room to increase public spending without pushing up Britain’s still high borrowing levels.

The country’s budget forecasters have signaled they are about to turn more gloomy about growth forecasts, meaning less tax revenue to fund Hammond’s war-chest to help the economy weather the process of leaving the EU in the coming years.

But he is already under pressure now to relax his grip on spending to counter the left-wing opposition Labour Party whose promises of more spending and higher taxes on the wealthy won over large numbers of voters in the June election.

At the same time, Hammond must not alarm investors who fund a budget shortfall which is expected to grow this year.

WARSAW (Reuters) - South Korea’s LG Chem will open Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region’s auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group (VOWG_p.DE) to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometers (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea’s LG Corp, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

“The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,” said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development center employing “about 400 engineers from various specializations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT”.

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem’s local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory’s planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory’s capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla’s U.S. based “Gigafactory” is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG’s Polish plant may not remain Europe’s largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe’s largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla’s Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where.",LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lgchem-factory-poland/lg-to-open-europes-biggest-car-battery-factory-next-year-idUSKBN1CH21W

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic “caliphate” Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries.

Following are some facts about Raqqa:

THE CITY

Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.

Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.

THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.

The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.

ITS PEOPLE

The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians.

The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.

Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.

Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.

Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.

The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.

Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa’s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule.

AFTER THE FIGHTING

The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.

The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border.

The SDF’s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured.

The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.

Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border.

Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.

HERITAGE

A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point.

It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archaeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai were comfortably ahead in partial presidential election results announced on Saturday, and look set to contest a run-off next month.

Weah and Boakai lead the 20-candidate field to succeed Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in what would be Liberia’s first democratic transfer of power in more than 70 years.

Weah received 39.2 percent of roughly 1.2 million ballots cast in nearly three-quarters of polling stations, ahead of Boakai, who had 29.6 percent of the vote, the commission said. Charles Brumskine, a lawyer, was a distant third with 9.7 percent.

The final certified results from Tuesday’s poll must be announced by Oct. 25, although provisional results from the remaining precincts are expected in the coming days.

The commission said that ballots would be re-cast in two polling places in Nimba County due to irregularities, although that measure only concerns a few thousand votes.

CIVIL WAR

Weah became the first non-European to win the European player of the year award in 1995, the same year he picked up the African and World player of the year awards.

He finished runner-up to Johnson Sirleaf in a 2005 election that helped draw a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. He has been a senator for the opposition CDC party since 2014.

Boakai, the former head of Liberia’s petroleum refinery company and agriculture minister, has served as Liberia’s vice president since 2006 and represents the ruling Unity Party.

Brumskine has said the vote was marred by fraud and that he would request a re-run. However, he has yet to produce evidence of cheating and international observers said they saw no major problems.

Police officers look on as they stand guard at National Election Commission headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon

Johnson Sirleaf’s 12 years in office have seen the consolidation of Liberia’s post-war peace and the quadrupling in size of the national economy. However, many Liberians complain about poor public services and widespread corruption and say they are eager for a new president.

Weah’s strong first-round performance drew mixed reactions on the streets of Monrovia, the capital.

One woman held a small radio close to her ear as the latest results were read out by the state broadcaster. “We will see a new president now come next year,” she said. “Our son Weah will be the next president.”

Standing nearby, a man in his late 50s, Cyrus S. Mulbah, had a different view.

“It will be a sad mistake if this country goes in the hands of Weah and his people,” he said “This is not a football field.”",Soccer star Weah and VP Boakai near Liberia presidential run-off,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CK07Q-OZATP

As Trump announced that he had chosen not to certify Tehran is complying with the deal but would not immediately withdraw from it, Republican Senators Bob Corker and Tom Cotton offered an outline of legislation they said would “address flaws” in the accord.

If passed, the measure would set stricter restrictions on Iran and immediately revive U.S. sanctions imposed over Iran’s nuclear program if Tehran is deemed able to produce a nuclear weapon within a year.

“We have provided a route to overcome deficiencies (in the agreement) and to keep the administration in the deal, and actually make it the kind of deal that it should have been in the first place,” Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on a call with journalists.

Republicans control Congress, but their four-seat edge in the Senate means any measure would need Democratic support to pass, even if every member of Trump’s party supports it.

That is not a given.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he had “serious doubts” about the Corker-Cotton plan. He said he would reserve judgment until the final measure, but preferred that Trump abandon the deal.

“Ultimately, leaving the nuclear deal, reimposing suspended sanctions, and having the president impose additional sanctions would serve our national interest better than a decertified deal that leaves sanctions suspended or a new law that leaves major flaws in that agreement in place,” Rubio said in a statement.

Most Democrats were strongly opposed.

Senator Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, said he would only support a measure backed by European allies who had signed the nuclear pact, formally known as the JCPOA.

“Anything we do must be consistent with the JCPOA, cannot lead us on a path to violate the JCPOA and must have the support of our European allies,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Cardin said he wanted a full-Senate briefing on the plan from administration officials, and then committee hearings.

MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. actor Steven Seagal, famous for playing action roles like a vice squad detective in “Above the Law”, met Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte while on a location scouting trip in Manila.

Video footage released by government channel RTVM showed Seagal animatedly talking to Duterte.

Seagal, 65, was in the Philippines to look for a location for his upcoming movie which will be “about illegal drugs and other crimes”, a presidential palace statement said.

The statement said that Duterte told Seagal that “movies are a reflection of life” and “reiterated his strong stance against illegal drugs because it enslaves people to a form of synthetic chemical.”

Duterte has been involved in a deadly drug war since taking office last June, and on Wednesday ordered all drug operations be left to the drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct in the brutal crackdown that has left thousands of Filipinos dead.

Earlier this week, Seagal said at a news conference in Manila that he didn’t think the Philippines was “a dangerous place”.

“It’s a place that’s up and coming with the new leadership,” the Philippine Star reported him as saying.

Duterte was nicknamed “The Punisher” due to his zero-tolerance of crime and drugs during the 22 years he was mayor of southern Davao City.

A former martial arts instructor, Seagal is famous for action hero roles in blockbuster movies in the 1990s, such as “Under Siege” and “Hard To Kill”.

He has also starred in a reality television series called “Steven Seagal: Lawman”, in which he carries out duties as a reserve deputy sheriff in Louisiana.","Steven Seagal meets 'The Punisher' Duterte, talks drug war",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CI0CG-OCAEN

“There were 10 people aboard including six crew members, three French soldiers and a French civilian who was working for the (aviation) company,” Silue said at a news conference. He said the plane was registered in Moldova, but did not name the company.

Silue said he did not yet have information about what caused the crash, though he noted that the weather was “very bad” along the approach to the airport.

An investigation had been launched and Ivorian authorities were in contact with their French and Moldovan counterparts, he said. The four injured French citizens were being treated at the French military base adjacent to the airport.

France’s ambassador to Ivory Coast, along with French gendarmes and soldiers, had quickly arrived at the crash site, where hundreds of local residents gathered to look at the wreckage.

“The courts now will consider the appeal from Uber and of course TfL will defend the decision they made,” he said.","LONDON (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] lodged a court appeal on Friday to overturn a decision by London’s transport regulator that stripped the taxi app of its operating license in its most important European market, the first stop on what is set to be a long legal road.

Transport for London (TfL) shocked the Silicon Valley firm last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license, citing its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.

The appeal marks the beginning of months of legal wrangling in a battle that had pitched one of the world’s richest cities against a Silicon Valley giant known for forays into new markets across the globe that have stoked competition for established cab companies.

Uber, whose backers include Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, will defend its London business at a hearing most likely due on Dec. 11, a spokesman at Britain’s Judicial Office told Reuters.

Uber, criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for employing an “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers”, said that it hoped to keep talking to TfL to find a way forward.

“While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London,” an Uber spokesman said.

“As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.”

Only a month into the job, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi met TfL Commissioner Mike Brown for talks earlier in October, which both sides said were constructive as the $70-billion firm tries to repair its relationship with the regulator.

Uber’s license expired on Sep. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers in the British capital will be able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.

Friday’s appeal was submitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London as part of the first stage of a legal process which could take months or years to reach a conclusion.

The filing is a short notification of Uber’s intention to appeal rather than the detailed grounds.

DISRUPTIVE YEAR

London’s decision is one of the most serious setbacks to the taxi app, which has been forced to quit several countries, including Denmark and Hungary, and faced regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

It comes after a tumultuous few months for the San Francisco start-up that led to former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick being forced out after a series of boardroom controversies.

Earlier this month, the firm’s boss in Britain Jo Bertram said she would quit the taxi hailing app according to emails seen by Reuters.

The company is also embroiled in court action against two drivers who won a tribunal case last year entitling them to workers’ rights such as the minimum wage and holiday entitlement, threatening its business model. Uber is appealing the verdict.

TfL said on Friday it would not comment before the licensing appeal hearing due later this year.

A spokesman at the Mayor of London’s office said that Khan, a politician from the opposition Labour Party who is also chairman of TfL, continued to back the license decision and that all private hire firms must play by the rules.

He said during a monthly question time session on Thursday that the transport authority would defend its decision during the legal action.

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idUKKBN1CK058?il=0

Atwood’s dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale”, first published in 1985, has shot back up the bestseller lists after being made into an award-winning TV series depicting a totalitarian future in a United States where women are forced into sexual servitude.

Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president has, for some critics, brought that vision closer to reality as he uses social media to browbeat opponents, and lawmakers in a number of states seek to restrict women’s reproductive rights.

“It feels the closest to the 1930s of anything that we have had since that time,” the 77-year-old Atwood told a news conference, drawing parallels with the fascist and communist regimes which then ruled parts of Europe.

Atwood was attending the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, where she receives the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade on Sunday. The award citation praises Atwood’s “political awareness and alertness for developments beneath the surface”.

Past winners include Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, American writer and film-maker Susan Sontag and Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian-born writer and politician.

It’s a far cry from the Berlin of the Cold War, still surrounded by the wall that divided Germany, where she started writing The Handmaid’s Tale, she recalled.

“People in Europe saw the United States as a beacon of democracy, freedom, openness, and they did not want to believe that anything like that could ever happen there,” she said.

“But now, times have changed, and, unfortunately it becomes more possible to think in those terms.”

Although work on the TV series starring Elisabeth Moss began before last November’s U.S. presidential election, Trump’s victory changed the setting “quite radically”, said Atwood.

“That is one of the reasons that the show has been so popular ... people suddenly feel that it’s a possible reality for them,” she said.

Women’s rights activists clad in the distinctive white bonnets and red gowns worn by handmaids in the fictional theocratic state of Gilead have taken part in recent protests in several U.S. state capitals.

“The book has escaped from the covers, the television show has escaped from being just a show,” said Atwood.

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova won her first WTA title in more than two years at the Tianjin Open on Sunday, showing plenty of grit and determination as she came from behind in each set to beat Belarusian teenager Aryna Sabalenka 7-5 7-6(8).

The former world number one, who returned to the tour in April following a 15-month doping ban, started the stronger, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game, but struggled on serve and soon found herself trailing 4-1 in the first set.

The Russian managed to hold serve for the first time in the match at 4-2 and clung on grimly in the face of some hard hitting by her 19-year-old opponent before converting her fourth break point of the next game to get back on serve at 4-3.

Her nerves settled, Sharapova began to hit her stride, breaking Sabalenka again to go 6-5 up before closing out the set.

The Belarusian, playing her first WTA final, came back in the second set, opening up a 5-1 lead before serving to send the match into a decider, but Sharapova once again fought back to erase the deficit.

DUBAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is considering the sale of a stake to a Chinese investor as plans for its highly-anticipated international public offering are pushed beyond its 2018 target, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The initial public offering is expected to be the world’s largest stock sale, and is a key component of the Saudi government’s economic reform program which aims to diversify the desert kingdom away from its reliance on oil exports.

A private placement of shares in the state oil company to a Chinese investor is being evaluated as a precursor to the international IPO, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was not public.

They declined to name the investor or how much of Aramco would be sold.

The move would provide Saudi Arabia with cash to help implement the National Transformation Program (NTP), as the reform package is formally known, according to one of the sources.

The NTP comprises a number of difficult economic adjustments for Saudi Arabia - including removing some state subsidies and raising taxes - that are aimed at taming huge budget deficits caused by lower oil prices.

Concerns about the impact of the austerity measures on the economy are rising. While data earlier this month showed the deficit was shrinking, the Saudi economy entered recession in the second quarter, consumer prices are falling and unemployment among Saudis is at 12.8 percent.

A Saudi Aramco spokesman said: “A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track.”

Aramco’s dual listing on the Saudi stock market, Tadawul, and an international exchange had been earmarked for 2018 by the Saudi authorities - with stock markets in New York, London and Asia all vying for the offering.

A decision on which exchange would secure the offering has still not been made, with top members of the Saudi royal family preferring New York and Aramco’s financial and legal advisers advocating London.

Both venues have political issues which have caused the Saudis unease and delayed the location decision, according to a third source familiar with the matter.

The U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), passed in September 2016, allowed lawsuits to proceed against the Saudi government claiming it had helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and should pay damages to victims. Riyadh denies the allegations.

Meanwhile, London’s markets regulator has been criticized for proposing new listing rules aimed at attracting state-controlled companies such as Aramco, which some U.K. industry groups have warned would weaken investor protection.

The third source added an international IPO beyond 2018 was still very much an option, while a Tadawul listing was on track for 2018, pointing to comments from senior Saudi officials, such as those made in Moscow earlier this month.

The Financial Times reported that Aramco had held talks about a private stake sale to foreign governments — including China — and other investors, amid growing concerns about the feasibility of an international listing.(on.ft.com/2gBheCT)",Saudi Aramco in stake sale talks with Chinese investor: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudiaramco-ipo/saudi-aramco-in-stake-sale-talks-with-chinese-investor-sources-idUSKBN1CI2GS

TORONTO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Friday it reached a tentative labor agreement with striking workers at its CAMI plant in Canada, ending an almost month-old dispute.

Some 2,500 workers at the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, in southern Ontario, walked off the job on Sept. 18 after the U.S. automaker rejected a union call to designate the factory as lead production site for the Chevrolet Equinox model in North America.

“These members have shown incredible courage and strength by standing up for good jobs and a secure future for their families and their community,” Jerry Dias, president of Unifor National, the main union leading the contract talks, said in a statement.

“This strike has shown all of Canada why a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement must address the needs of working people first,” he said.

The agreement is subject to member ratification, and Unifor said details of the deal will not be released until after the vote is held. The ratification vote has not yet been scheduled.

This week, the dispute ratcheted up when GM warned the union that it would start winding down production at the CAMI plant and ramp up output of the popular Equinox SUV at two plants in Mexico unless workers called off their strike.

The union had blamed NAFTA and Mexico’s cheaper labor costs for job losses.

GM moved production of the Terrain SUV to Mexico this year, resulting in about 400 layoffs at CAMI.

Dias said on Thursday that GM had ”declared war on Canada,“ and called the labor dispute ”the poster child of what’s wrong with NAFTA.

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova won her first WTA title in more than two years at the Tianjin Open on Sunday, showing plenty of grit and determination as she came from behind in each set to beat Belarusian teenager Aryna Sabalenka 7-5 7-6(8).

The former world number one, who returned to the tour in April following a 15-month doping ban, started the stronger, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game, but struggled on serve and soon found herself trailing 4-1 in the first set.

The Russian managed to hold serve for the first time in the match at 4-2 and clung on grimly in the face of some hard hitting by her 19-year-old opponent before converting her fourth break point of the next game to get back on serve at 4-3.

Her nerves settled, Sharapova began to hit her stride, breaking Sabalenka again to go 6-5 up before closing out the set.

The Belarusian, playing her first WTA final, came back in the second set, opening up a 5-1 lead before serving to send the match into a decider, but Sharapova once again fought back to erase the deficit.

The 30-year-old broke Sabalenka twice in succession and held her nerve when facing a set point on serve at 5-4 to level things up, and broke the Belarusian to give herself the chance to serve out the match at 6-5.

But there was more drama to come. The Russian, who sent down seven aces during the contest, double faulted when facing a break point to gift Sabalenka the game and send the set into a tiebreak.

TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) said a licensing deal it signed with low-end Android handset maker BLU Products Inc will bring it recurring revenue, ending a legal dispute over patents that rival Google has asked the U.S. government to revoke.

BlackBerry did not disclose financial terms and its shares were little changed after the news, rising 0.5 percent in late Thursday morning Nasdaq trade BBRY.O.

BlackBerry filed two lawsuits against Miami-based BLU in June 2016, part of an effort by the Canadian company to generate revenue from its trove of technology patents.

Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google responded to lawsuits against a maker of phones running its Android operating system by challenging six of the patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

In late August and early September, a patent office appeal board said that Google had a “reasonable likelihood” of winning the invalidation of four patents in a full review.

The deal between BlackBerry and BLU was likely secured prior to a July 19 memorandum of understanding filed with the court hearing their patent dispute. The two firms have declined to disclose financial terms of that agreement.

BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a Sept. 28 earnings call that his company had received revenue from BLU, but did not elaborate.

It was not clear if that payment was included in that quarter’s earnings, which beat analysts’ forecast on a jump in licensing fees that includes patent payouts and royalties on BlackBerry-branded devices and software sold by others.

Patent licensing deals are typically structured with an upfront payment to cover past sales and ongoing royalty payments tied to future sales.

Market intelligence company IDC estimates that BLU accounts for less than 1 percent of global smartphone market share.

BlackBerry said in its statement on Thursday that the completion of the BLU deal allows it to focus on other licensing targets in the mobile communications industry.

“Anytime you have royalty-bearing licenses, you are setting a market rate,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dallas-based patent consulting firm Dominion Harbor Group, which recently analyzed BlackBerry’s patent portfolio on behalf of a group of handset manufacturers.

“Doing so with a smaller player will be helpful as BlackBerry turns its attention to larger market incumbents,” he said.

En una declaración, la organización que otorga los premios Oscar dijo que en una votación de su Junta de Gobernadores de 54 integrantes se “sobrepasó ampliamente la mayoría requerida de dos tercios para expulsarlo inmediatamente de la Academia”.

La portavoz de Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios sobre esta decisión.

La expulsión de Weinstein de la organización más prestigiosa de la industria del cine tiene lugar después de que The New York Times y The New Yorker reportaron acusaciones de varias mujeres que señalan haber sido acosadas o agredidas sexualmente por Weinstein desde la década de 1980.

Reuters no ha conseguido confirmar de manera independiente ninguna de las acusaciones. Weinstein, de 65 años y ganador de un premio Oscar, ha negado mantener sexo no consentido.

Al anunciar la decisión de expulsar a Weinstein, la Academia dijo que también estaba enviando un mensaje más amplio. “No estamos simplemente alejándonos de alguien que no merece el respeto de sus colegas, sino también enviando un mensaje de que la ignorancia deliberada y la complicidad vergonzosa respecto a un comportamiento sexual depredador y el acoso laboral en nuestra industria han terminado”, señaló.

“Lo que está en juego aquí es un problema muy preocupante que no tiene cabida en nuestra sociedad”, añadió la declaración. “La junta continúa trabajando para establecer estándares éticos de conducta que puedan sean ejemplificados por todos los miembros de la Academia”.

La policía de Nueva York dijo esta semana que estaba investigando una acusación de agresión sexual del año 2004 contra Weinstein. Esta semana Weinstein también fue suspendido por la academia cinematográfica británica BAFTA.

Sus acusadoras incluyen a la actriz Gwyneth Paltrow, que dijo a The New York Times que fue acosada por Weinstein hace más de 20 años, así como la actriz y directora Angelina Jolie, que dijo a la publicación que tuvo “una mala experiencia con Harvey Weinstein” en su juventud y que por eso decidió “nunca más volver a trabajar con él”.",Academia Cinematográfica de EEUU expulsa a Harvey Weinstein,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idLTAKBN1CJ0SF-OUSLE

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

SANTA ROSA (Reuters) - Authorities hope weaker winds will help more than 10,000 firefighters battle the deadliest blazes in California history, which have killed at least 40 people and destroyed thousands of structures in one of the state’s worst natural disasters in years.

Fast-moving fires spread by shifting winds forced thousands more to evacuate their homes on Saturday as the death toll over the week rose to 40, with hundreds missing.

More than 10,000 firefighters supported by air tankers and helicopters battled 16 major wildfires in areas north of San Francisco that have consumed nearly 214,000 acres (86,000 hectares), or roughly 334 square miles (865 sq km) - an area larger than New York City.

The 40 confirmed fatalities, including 22 in Sonoma County, make it California’s deadliest-ever fire event, surpassing the 29 deaths from the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles.

With 235 people still missing on Saturday in Sonoma County alone and rubble from thousands of incinerated dwellings yet to be searched, authorities expect the death toll to climb.

Some 100,000 people have been forced from their homes, including 3,000 on Saturday from the city of Santa Rosa, about 50 miles (80 km) north of San Francisco. The fires have damaged or destroyed about 5,700 structures, reducing homes and businesses to ash.

Some victims were asleep when flames engulfed their homes, while others had only minutes to flee.

“This is truly one of the greatest tragedies that California has ever faced. The devastation is just unbelievable. It is a horror that no one could have imagined,” California Governor Jerry Brown said on a visit to a devastated city.

Janis and Roberto Lucha joined people lining up at a Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Santa Rosa, seeking help after losing their home of 27 years in the city’s Coffey Park neighborhood, where most homes burned to the ground.

Molly Kurland, 63, joined a packed community meeting at the Santa Rosa High School gymnasium.

“Even for people who haven’t lost their house, the uncertainty and anxiety is tremendous,” she said.

But there were heroic stories as well.

The persistent alarms from Benjamin Lasker, 16, gave the family time to escape the conflagration with little more than the clothes on their backs.

Benjamin and his twin sister, Natalie, went on to awaken another eight families in their Fountain Grove neighborhood in Santa Rosa, pounding on doors, yelling “Fire!” and shining lights in windows.

“They asked permission to wake people up,” Howard Lasker told Reuters, adding “I gave it to them.”

GLIMMERS OF HOPE

There were some glimmers of hope as winds weakened and firefighters made progress with blazes such as the Cascade Fire, about 80 miles northeast of Santa Rosa, which was nearly 10,000 acres and 87 percent contained on Saturday, Cal Fire said.

Weakening winds overnight should help but high temperatures and dry conditions were expected to remain through the weekend, forecasters said.

”This is still very much in play. The danger is still very present,” said U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California who accompanied Brown.

At least a dozen Napa Valley and Sonoma County wineries were damaged or destroyed, throwing the state’s wine industry and related tourism into disarray.

For the picturesque Napa Valley town of Calistoga, now evacuated, the winds were a double-edged sword. The town was spared by hazardous winds when they shifted, but Mayor Chris Canning warned a resurgence could pose a new threat.

Fire officials said the Tubbs fire, between Calistoga and Santa Rosa, was about 44 percent contained, while another in wine country, the Atlas fire, was at 45 percent. But the Nuns fire west of Napa was only 10 percent contained.

Firefighters from Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Utah are helping battle the blazes.

Aircraft have dropped more than 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) of fire retardant.

Cal Fire estimated the fires would be contained by Oct. 20.

The year’s wildfire season is one of the worst in history in the United States, with nearly 8.6 million acres (3.5 million hectares) burned as of Oct. 13, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The worst on record for the same period in a year was 9.3 million acres in 2015.","California 'horror' fires burn on, 40 dead in one week",https://www.reuters.com/article/california-fire/california-horror-fires-burn-on-40-dead-in-one-week-idINKBN1CJ087

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis canonized 35 new Roman Catholic saints on Sunday, including three indigenous children martyred in 16th century Mexico and considered the first Christians killed for their faith in the New World.

Francis used the occasion to announce that he had decided to call a meeting of bishops, or synod, from countries in the Pan-Amazon region for October, 2019, to discuss the condition of the Church in the area and the plight of indigenous people.

The region includes Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil.

The three children the pope canonized before a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square were of the Talaxcaltec people, an indigenous pre-Colombian group in what is now Mexico.

The first child, Cristoforo, was converted to Christianity by Franciscan missionaries and was killed in 1527 by his own father, a tribal chief who spurned his son’s attempts to convert him from paganism.

The boy was beaten and thrown into a fire when he was 13.

Two other indigenous children from the same area, Antonio and Juan, were killed by Indios in the village of Cuauhtinchan in 1529 as a result of their conversion. They are believed to have been 12 or 13 when they were beaten to death for helping Dominican missionaries.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi

The pope also canonized 30 martyrs who were killed for their faith in Brazil in 1645. They included two Portuguese missionaries and 28 followers killed by Dutch colonial soldiers during a period of persecution of Catholics.

In announcing the 2019 synod for bishops from the Amazon region, Francis said indigenous people there today were “often abandoned and without the prospect of a bright future, even due to the crisis of the Amazon Forest, a lung of utmost importance for our planet”.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Francis, an Argentine and the first Latin American pope, has often linked his calls for social justice, particularly for indigenous people, to those for defense of the environment, saying the poor will suffer the most from the effects of climate change.

In 2015 he wrote a landmark encyclical, or papal letter, on defense of the environment and he has called for special protection for the Amazon region because of its vital importance to the planet’s ecosystem.

In his comments on Sunday, the pope did not mention the role of the Church in suppressing native cultures in the New World.

But during a visit to Bolivia in 2015, Francis said “many grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God”. He asked forgiveness for the Church, for “crimes committed against native peoples during the so-called conquest of America”.

On Sunday, Francis also canonized Father Faustino Miguez, a Spanish priest who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, and Father Angelo d‘Acri, an Italian itinerant preacher who died in 1739 after serving in some of the most remote areas of mountainous southern Italy.","Pope canonizes first New World martyrs, calls Amazon synod for 2019",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-canonisation/pope-canonizes-first-new-world-martyrs-calls-amazon-synod-for-2019-idUSKBN1CK0FX

Standesgemäß bei der Jahrestagung des Internationalen Währungsfonds (IWF) in Washington, bei der sich alles von Rang und Namen in der internationalen Geld- und Finanzpolitik ein Stelldichein gibt, verabschiedet er sich am Samstag von der Weltbühne der Finanzpolitik. Ein paar Wochen fehlen, dann wären es genau acht Jahre her gewesen, dass der heute 75-jährige Mann im Rollstuhl mit dem kuriosen Englisch erstmals auf dieser Bühne erschien. Das war an einem regnerischen Freitag, dem 6. November 2009, im schottischen St. Andrews. Auch damals stand eine Konferenz der G20-Finanzminister an, ebenso, wie er sie jetzt, am Rande der IWF-Konferenz, ein letztes Mal besucht.

Ein bisschen Wehmut beschleicht Schäuble, den weltweit ebenso geachteten wie gefürchteten Vollblutpolitiker, schon auf dem Weg in die US-Hauptstadt, wie er freimütig einräumt. “Acht Jahre sind eine lange Zeit”, sinniert er. Noch ein bisschen Arbeit, und “dann isch over”. Viele Kollegen will er noch einmal treffen, manche echte Freunde, wie IWF-Chefin Christine Lagarde, zu der er seit Jahren ein besonders herzliches Verhältnis pflegt. Die nennt ihn zum Abschied “einen Felsen, einen Giganten”. Sie gesteht: “Ich bin traurig, dass er geht.”

US-Finanzminister Steven Mnuchin, der es dem Gastgeber Schäuble bei der G20-Konferenz in Baden-Baden Anfang des Jahres alles andere als leicht machte, hat ihn zum Essen eingeladen. Der oft so harte Mann wird milde. “Ich bin mit mir im Reinen.” Und die deutsche G20-Präsidentschaft, die er an seinen argentinischen Kollegen übergibt, habe man gut hingekriegt.

UND IMMER EIN SCHUSS SELBSTIRONIE

In diesen acht Jahren hat sich Schäuble einen Ruf verdient. Er wurde zu einer der vernehmbarsten Stimmen in der internationalen Wirtschafts- und Finanzpolitik. Dabei hat er seinen Grundsatz, dass am Ende nur eine solide Budgetpolitik, Ausgabendisziplin und das Befolgen einmal aufgestellter Regeln Erfolg bringen, für manche Kritiker überstrapaziert. “Ich war nicht leicht zu ertragen”, gibt er zu. Häufig musste er sich mit seinen Positionen etwas alleine fühlen gegenüber all denen - allen voran die USA und der IWF -, die von Deutschland immer wieder mehr Ausgabenfreude forderten, um das schleppende Welt-Wachstum zu befeuern. Just zu seinem Abschied, es scheint, wie ein Abschiedsgeschenk, ändert sich der Wind. Plötzlich spricht auch der IWF mahnend vom Schuldenabbau, von soliden Haushalten. Eine Genugtuung für Schäuble, wie er zugibt.

Aber Schäuble will und wollte immer mehr sein als der sture Spar-Apostel - ihm ging es um Vertrauen, dass er wieder in die Märkte und ihre Akteure zurückbringen wollte. Er war es abseits dessen auch, der 2012 in Mexiko-City mit seinem Kollegen aus Großbritannien bei einer G20-Konferenz die BEPS-Initiative gegen Steuerflucht und gezielte Steuervermeidungsstrategien von international tätigen Unternehmen lostrat. Schäuble begab sich immer mitten hinein ins Kampfgetümmel. Ob es um mehr Stabilität ging, um Regeln dafür, mehr Risikovorsorge, neue Sicherheitspolster oder um die internationale Kritik am übermäßig hohen deutschen Überschuss in der Leistungs- und Handelsbilanz - der streitbare Mann rang an vorderster Front. Als Gegner war Schäuble ein harter Brocken.

SCHÄUBLE HAT SICH ZURÜCKHALTUNG VERORDNET

Der scheidende deutsche Finanzminister machte nie einen Hehl draus, dass er das Agieren auf der internationalen Bühne genoss, die Auftritte von Moskau bis Shanghai, von Ankara bis Tokio und Washington liebte. Er genoss es, die Dinge mit der ihm eigenen Ironie zu kommentieren, sich dabei auch immer wieder selbst zu persiflieren. Mit einem Augenzwinkern merkte er schon mal an, er nutze alle zur Verfügung stehenden Grausamkeiten, darunter die schlimmste: sein eigentümliches, etwas holpriges Englisch. Seine Wortgeschöpfe sind Legende, wie die - vor Zuhörern in Asien - zur Causa Griechenland: “It will not happen that there will be a Staatsbankrott in Greece.” Zurecht wies er einmal darauf hin: “Englisch ist bei mir immer ein interessantes Abenteuer.” Oder er entschuldigte sich: “Mir tut jeder leid, der mein Englisch ertragen muss.”

In seiner neuen Funktion, als Bundestagspräsident und damit als zweiter Mann im Staat, der er werden soll, wird Schäuble dieses Folterinstrument nicht mehr so häufig einsetzen müssen. An den Verhandlungen über eine neue Regierungskoalition will der Mann, der über Jahrzehnte einer der bestimmenden Politik-Macher in Deutschland war, nicht mehr teilnehmen. Nach der Rückkehr aus Washington ist dieses Kapitel im Leben des Wolfgang Schäuble vorbei. Er selbst hat sich eine Phase der Abkühlung verordnet. “Wenn ich mir selber einen Rat geben würde, würde ich mir sagen: Tue dich nicht zu allem öffentlich äußern, was dich gar nichts angeht”, lässt er die Zuhörer wissen. Aber nach kurzer Pause räumt er ein, das zu befolgen, sei schwer.",FEATURE-Wolfgang Schäuble - Schlussakkord in Moll,https://www.reuters.com/article/imf-g20-sch-uble-idDEKBN1CK0AB

Em nota, a defesa de Temer afirmou que “o vazamento de vídeos com depoimento prestado há quase dois meses pelo delator Lúcio Funaro constitui mais um abjeto golpe ao Estado Democrático de Direito” e que teria o objetivo de causar “estardalhaço” para constranger os parlamentares que votarão o parecer sobre a denúncia na CCJ.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL) said on Saturday it will not settle a long-standing intellectual property dispute with Monsanto Co (MON.N) over genetically modified (GM) cotton, despite some other Indian companies doing so in recent weeks.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that three Indian seed makers - Ajeet Seeds, Kaveri Seed Co Ltd KVRI.NS and Ankur Seeds - have agreed to resolve differences and end their arbitration proceedings with Monsanto (MON.N).

But Monsanto is yet to settle the dispute with Sri Rama Agri Genetics, Amar Biotech and NSL along with two group companies, Prabhat Agri Biotech and Pravardhan Seeds. “We do not want to compromise,” Narne Murali Krishna, a company secretary of NSL, said on the phone from Hyderabad, the capital of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. “On the IPR (intellectual property rights) matter, we’ll continue with our legal case in the Delhi High Court.”

Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Monsanto and local firm Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to more than 45 local cotton seed companies in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment.

Since then, Monsanto - which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE) for $66 billion - has been at loggerheads with the seed firms and India’s government over how much it can charge for its GM cotton seeds, costing it tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue a year.

“Based on the advice of competent IPR lawyers and communications of Monsanto with the Indian patent office, NSL realised that it was cheated by MMB’s false representations and claims on IPR,” Krishna said.

Earlier this year, citing a local law that excludes seeds from being patented, NSL’s Chairman and Managing Director M. Prabhakara Rao told Reuters that Monsanto should never have been allowed to collect royalties after an initial payment to use its technology.

At the very least, Rao added, prices should have been set by the government.

“Since we first signed the licensing agreement with Monsanto in 2004, we have paid 7.09 billion rupees ($109.59 million), which Monsanto should refund to NSL,” Krishna said.

A Monsanto spokesman said: “NSL has already collected the royalty fee from India’s cotton farmers.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The death toll from twin bomb blasts that struck busy junctions in the heart of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu has jumped to 85, making it one of the deadliest attacks since an Islamist insurgency began in 2007.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo declared three days of national mourning and called for donations of blood and funds to victims of Saturday’s attack. At least 100 others were wounded.

Police said a truck bomb exploded outside a hotel in the K5 intersection that is lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks, flattening several buildings and setting dozens of vehicles on fire.

Two hours later, another blast struck the capital’s Medina district.

“The number of dead has risen to 85. We know some 100 who were injured,” Mohamed Hussein, a police official, told Reuters, giving combined figures of casualties. He said the toll was likely to rise. Police previously said 22 people had died.

On Sunday, police and emergency workers searched the rubble of destroyed buildings. They also recovered dozens of corpses the night before, most of which were charred beyond recognition.

Hundreds of people came to the junction in search of missing family members and police cordoned off the area for security reasons.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, although the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which is allied to al Qaeda, stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country.

The group is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam.

Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump has been quietly cutting support for halfway houses for federal prisoners, severing contracts with as many as 16 facilities in recent months, prompting concern that some inmates are being forced to stay behind bars longer than necessary.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Justin Long confirmed the cuts in response to an email inquiry from Reuters, and said they only affect areas with small populations or underutilized centers.

“The Bureau remains firmly committed to these practices, but has had to make some modifications to our programs due to our fiscal environment,” Long said.

Halfway houses have been a part of the justice system since the 1960s, with thousands of people moving through them each year. For-profit prison companies such as Geo Group Inc have moved into the halfway house market, though many houses are run directly by government agencies or non-profit organizations.

The bureau, which falls under the U.S. Department of Justice, last year had about 180 competitive contracts with “residential reentry centers” run by non-profit and for-profit companies, such as Geo.

The International Community Corrections Association says on its website there were about 249 separate halfway houses in communities nationwide that are covered by the 180 contracts.

Federal judges who spoke to Reuters said the cuts are having an impact in their districts, particularly in states with fewer facilities or larger geographic areas where the nearest center might be several hundred miles away.

Judge Edmund Sargus of the Southern District of Ohio said it was a real “stumper” when in July the government ended its contract with the Alvis facility serving the Dayton area.

Long said that the cuts have not reduced referral rates or placements, and only impact “about 1% of the total number of beds under contract.”

However, the changes coincide with other major criminal justice policy shifts by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has pushed for more aggressive prosecutions of drug offenses and a crackdown on illegal immigrants who commit crimes.

In May, Sessions ordered prosecutors to charge defendants with the highest provable offense, a move that is likely to trigger lengthy prison sentences.

In 2016, of the 43,000 inmates released from federal prison, 79 percent were released into a halfway house or home confinement, according to the trade association.

“We need to improve re-entry services ... This move flies in the face of that consensus,” said Kevin Ring, whose non-profit Families Against Mandatory Minimums has recently launched a Twitter campaign to raise awareness of the problem.

Sessions is scheduled to testify next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ring said he hopes lawmakers will ask Sessions about the changes underway for halfway houses.

“Is cutting re-entry opportunities really going to make us safer? Congress needs to ask the Justice Department if this is part of their strategy,” he said.

LONGER PRISON TIMES

For Kymjetta Carr, the cuts have had a personal impact. The 30-year-old from Cincinnati said she had expected her fiance Anthony Lamar to get out of prison and go to a halfway house in November, after serving seven years on a drug charge.

But she now has to tell their 10-year-old son his father won’t be out for Christmas or his birthday because Lamar’s release to a halfway house will not come until late July.

“It seems like the rug has been pulled out from under us,” she said, in an interview arranged through Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Halfway houses are low-security residences for thousands of convicted prisoners serving alternative sentences or on release from prison into partial freedom programs on the outside. The facilities are meant to help prisoners reenter their communities, find a job and get their lives back on track.

A study commissioned last year by the Justice Department found that centers have come under greater strain in recent years, as more people have been released from prison.

Blair Campmier, executive director of Reality House in Columbia, Missouri, said he was notified in early June that the center’s eight-year-old contract would be terminated.

Some of his clients were sent to halfway houses in Kansas City and Springfield, more than two hours away. “They were not happy, and their families were not happy,” said Campmier.

Ricardo Martinez, the Chief U.S. District Judge in the Western District of Washington and Chairman of the Committee on Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference of the United States, told Reuters he has sent a letter to the Bureau of Prisons’ new Director Mark Inch requesting discussions.

“From our perspective, these facilities are not only useful - they are essential,” Martinez said.",Exclusive: Trump administration reduces support for prisoner halfway houses,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-prisons-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-reduces-support-for-prisoner-halfway-houses-idUSKBN1CI2ZA?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

路透10月11日 - “埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收。”

圣经中，约瑟这样解读法老梦到的七头肥美的牛和七头干瘦的牛，但他可能也是在说油市。(创世纪第41章29-30节)

就像尼罗河是否泛滥决定法老的王国经历丰足还是饥馑一样，油市也在供应的短缺与过剩之间反复。

“油市的问题总是(供应)不是太多就是太少，”纽约大学经济学教授Myron Watkins在80年前写道(石油：稳定还是保护？ Watkins, 1937)。

古埃及食物供应的充足或短缺交替出现，但很少有“刚好够用”的时候，因此埃及用谷仓来储存丰年的多余供应，以备歉收时使用。

油市也把供应过剩时的库存留到供应不足时使用，油价也随之有规律地从正价差转至逆价差。

油市的自然状态不是刚刚够用，正好像埃及食物供应的自然状态也不是刚好够用。

石油输出国组织(OPEC)和包括我自己在内的其他评论人士都把限产和降低过剩库存的过程看做是市场“恢复平衡”的一环。

将调节石油生产、消费及库存的一整套复杂过程，以“再平衡”简称，虽然很便利，但这并不代表整个过程的终点就是一个“平衡”的油市。

油市很少平衡，更从来没能长期维持平衡。

在以往，油市出现一些供应过剩及正价差时期后，很快就回到供应短缺和逆价差时期。

图表：reut.rs/2kFtoix

目前看来正在上演类似的情况，布兰特及其他国际原油品种原本从2014年年中以来皆维持正价差，但在过去三个月转为逆价差。

多数分析师已开始担心重新出现供应过剩、原油库存恢复上升、以及石油输出国组织(OPEC)及其盟友2018年将如何退出现行的限产协议。

但仍存在的一个可能是，当石油需求强劲成长时，油市正要进入供应短缺时期，供应步伐将落后，而石油库存将紧俏。

**正向反馈**

油价很少能够平顺地适应石油产量或消费的变动(“Essentials of petroleum: a key to oil economics”, Frankel, 1946)。

石油产量、消费、库存、及油价之间的关系，具有循环因果或反馈过程特色(“Cybernetics, or command and control in the animal and the human”, Wiener, 1948)。

其中一些过程促进油市稳定，并倾向于抑制最初干扰(“负反馈”)，但是其他过程则破坏稳定，并且倾向于放大初始冲击(“正反馈”)。

正反馈过程可能在中短期内造成市况极其不稳。2014至2016年油市下滑期间，正反馈使得跌势更加严重并延迟了再平衡。

例如在供应方面，油价下跌导致劳动力、原材料和服务合同的价格下降，抑制了生产商对价格下降的反应(tmsnrt.rs/2xxifGQ)。

在需求方面，产油国的经济衰退，以及钻井活动萧条和全球货运放缓，都大大降低了石油消耗，尤其是柴油，结果加剧了供应过剩。

但正反馈是把双刃剑，正如它可以加深和拉长跌势，同样也可能加快和放大涨势。

油市再平衡可能会推动成本上涨，产油国的消费增长加快，以及货运活动加速成长。

在原油市场，就像法老治下的埃及一样，一切往往都同时正确(或者错误)，在商品周期内造成剧烈波动。

**上涨要素**

2018和2019年油市周期性好转的所有要素都已齐备。

全球主要经济体都在经历近十年来最强劲同步扩张，世界贸易量的增长速度也创下2011年以来最快。

全球整体经济扩张加上相对较低的油价，促成了石油需求激增，令过去三年的石油消费增速快于长期均值水平。

根据国际能源署(IEA)的数据，全球石油消费量在2017年预估将增加160万桶/日，2016年和2015年的消费增幅则分别为130万桶/日和190万桶/日。

IEA的9月报告称，预计2018年全球石油消费进一步增加140万桶/日。

受强劲需求和沙特限制供应的影响，全球原油和油品库存正在迅速下降。

库存虽然仍高于五年均值，但正在向五年均值靠拢。考虑到2012年以来惊人的消费增长，五年均值的水平终究可能还是过低。

关键的问题在于，石油生产商将以多快的速度对需求增强和石油库存趋紧做出回应。

由于大多数生产方已经接近100%的全产能运营，因此未来两年的产出增长将主要来自于沙特阿拉伯(和其亲密盟友科威特)、内乱冲突迭起的非洲，或是美国页岩油生产商。

沙特拥有闲置产能，但该国在增加市场供应前，会希望先看到油价走高，特别是在沙特阿美部分资产临近上市之际。

尼日利亚和利比亚也拥有闲置产能，但国内安全形势堪忧，使得两国未来增产存在很大的不确定性。

美国页岩油生产商也可以提高产量，但他们的成本正在升高，股东也越来越要求他们侧重于提高回报而非增加产量。

**接下来会怎样？**

2018/19年油市可能出现的景象如下：

* 如果OPEC减产协议执行率下降、美国页岩油产量又迅速增加，超过了需求增长，那么油价涨势和逆价差可能会消失。

* 如果OPEC顺利退出减产协议，页岩油产量增长追平需求增长，那么油价和日历价差可能将继续区间盘整。

* 如果消费增长超过供应，而且库存持续下降，那么至少油价会进一步上涨，逆价差也会扩大。

许多分析师和交易商的预期带有追溯性质，假设未来将重演刚刚发生的景象，所以他们往往会错过转折点。

2011-2014年繁荣期后，市场预期过于乐观，因此许多分析师和交易商没有料到跌势已经迫近，之后还低估了下跌的幅度和持续时间。

但在这次大跌后市场预期或许已经变得过于悲观，交易商目前低估了油市反弹的前景。

当然，考虑到页岩油生产商和OPEC顺利进行调整以满足需求增长，油市总是有可能拥有充足供应。

LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.

1/ POLITICAL EVENT STORM

Political and event risk over the coming week ranges from the possible collapse of NAFTA talks to China’s Party Congress and third-quarter Chinese growth data. Japan’s general election will follow the weekend after.

Europe holds an EU summit amid deadlocked Brexit talks, Catalonia faces a deadline to clarify its fudged independence move from Spain and Sunday’s Austrian elections could give it one of the youngest world leaders ever.

The G20 meets this weekend around the annual IMF meeting, and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda all speak. Kuroda’s future at the BoJ could well be influenced by how Prime Minister Shinzo Abe does in Japan’s elections.

Markets are getting into the third-quarter global earnings season as well.

2/ FED TIME

Speculation is swirling that U.S. President Donald Trump will announce his choice to replace Yellen at the Fed next year.

The nearly nine-year rally in risk assets is based on the so-called Bernanke put - and now the Yellen put - of ultra-low interest rates and ample liquidity. So the name drawing the most scrutiny is Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and avowed opponent of the “put” policies. Would that remove an important underpinning of the global rally, and at this point, would it matter?

In any case, come February, Trump may have nominated five of the seven members of the central bank’s board of governors, including the chair and two vice chairs.

3/ NAFTA NO MORE?

Washington has dramatically increased tensions in talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement by proposing a ‘sunset clause’ that would force re-negotiations of the $1 trillion pact every five years. Sources have told Reuters atmosphere at the talks is “horrible”.

Mexico is expected to suffer the most damage if NAFTA breaks down, as most of its exports go to the United States. Analysts expect growth to slow and the peso to weaken.

Its finance minister, Jose Antonio Meade, has said his country is analyzing tariffs and import substitution plans in case NAFTA is scrapped. The peso MXN= is near a five-month low, Mexican stocks have lost almost 4 percent since mid-August and dollar bond prices have slipped across the curve, the 2026 issue trading at three-month lows.

U.S. hikes tensions in NAFTA talks with call for 'sunset clause'

4/ CHINA CONGRESS

China is preparing for a pivotal event. The Communist Party Congress open on Oct. 18 and will see most of the country’s top officials replaced. But all eyes will be on President Xi Jinping, who could upend decades of party tradition by seizing more power and signal he is eyeing an unprecedented third term.

Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on liberalization path. But the fear is he will dismantle the consensus-based checks and balances put in place to prevent a return to the excesses of the Mao era.

There are also questions about the tenure of Wang Qishan, the country’s anti-corruption czar, who at 69 is considered too old for promotion, according to an unwritten rule.

Investors do not expect market volatility during the summit; regulators have already said maintaining stability will be a priority. But expected reforms of state-run companies boosted shares in defense enterprises on Friday and the yuan has gained around 1 percent this week.

Watch: Xi propaganda in high gear for China's party congress

5/ BURNING EARNINGS

A host of big U.S. companies are due to report earnings, among them Morgan Stanley, IBM, Verizon, Procter & Gamble and General Electric. Tech heavyweights SAP and ASML will report in Europe, along with Unilever, Daimler and Nestle.

Analysts have scaled back earnings forecasts for both U.S. and European companies, making it more likely they will beat the lowered expectations.

And while investors are watching with trepidation for signs of a market peak, many remain positive on U.S. stocks, expecting tax cuts to provide a further boost.

Europe is headed for its best year of earnings growth since 2010, Goldman Sachs strategists predict, as an economic recovery helps drive corporate profits.

The Swiss world number two beat Nadal in the finals of the Australian Open and Miami Masters and in the last 16 at Indian Wells earlier this year, and never looked like losing to his long-time rival in Shanghai, firing 10 aces as he cruised to victory.

Federer, the only man who can still stop Nadal ending the year as number one, took an hour and 12 minutes to claim his sixth title of the year and his second Shanghai crown with a clinical performance.

”It’s a wonderful moment for me to be back here playing against my good friend and rival, Rafa... We didn’t think maybe we were going to have the year we did.

“I definitely didn‘t, so it’s just nice to share this court with you today and hopefully there’s more to come in the tournaments we’ve got left. It’s been a pleasure playing against you again today.”

Playing under a closed roof at the Qi Zhong Tennis Center, Federer sprinted out of the blocks, breaking Nadal in the opening game and the Spaniard had little answer to the sheer variety of shots coming across the net.

The Swiss refused to take his foot off the pedal in the second set, breaking Nadal to go 3-2 up and keeping his cool to wrap up victory.

He sealed the win on his opponent’s serve, winning the second of three match points to claim his 94th career title.

Federer, who won the tournament in 2014, has enjoyed himself on the fast courts of Shanghai this year, while Nadal will look back on a successful stint in Asia after winning last week’s China Open.

“I want to congratulate Roger and his team for a great year. Today I think you played a fantastic match, so many congratulations,” Nadal said.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Taliban spokesman denied on Sunday accusations by a Canadian man that one of his children had been murdered and his wife raped while they were being held captive by militants who kidnapped them in Afghanistan in 2012.

Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were held by the Haqqani network, a semi-independent wing of the Afghan Taliban, before being rescued by Pakistani troops in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghan border, last week.

Boyle told reporters soon after he, his wife and their three children returned to Canada on Friday that their captors had murdered a fourth child had raped his wife.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that as propaganda by the Western governments that helped rescue the family.

“We strongly reject these fake and fabricated allegations of this Canadian family, now in the hands of the enemy,” he said in a statement sent to media.‎

“Whatever statement the enemy wants to put in their mouth, the family is forced to make it.”

Boyle called on the Taliban to “provide my family with the justice we deserve”.

Mujahid said the couple was intentionally never separated in order to protect their safety.

He also denied that their child had been murdered, but acknowledged that one child became sick and died.

“We were in a remote areas without access to a doctor and medications that led the loss of the child,” he said.

Three children, all born in captivity, were rescued along with Boyle and Coleman.

The U.S. government calls the Haqqani network “the most lethal and sophisticated insurgent group” in Afghanistan.

Its operational chief, Sirajuddin Haqqani, was named deputy to the Taliban’s newly appointed leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in 2015, cementing the ties between the groups.

The Haqqanis previously held U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed in a swap for Taliban prisoners in 2014, and are suspected of holding two professors, an American and an Australian, who were kidnapped outside their university in Kabul in 2016.

A senior Afghan government official told Reuters that American and Afghan special forces launched two unsuccessful raids to try to rescue the professors in Afghanistan, but officials now believe the pair has been taken to Haqqani hideouts over the border in Pakistan.","Afghan Taliban deny former hostage's claims of murder, rape",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CK09T-OCATP

LONDON (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond apologised for describing the European Union as “the enemy” in the Brexit negotiations, an embarrassing stumble for a man who is under fire from within his own party over his approach to the talks.

In an interview with Sky News television on Friday, Hammond tried to quell the anger among some Conservatives who have accused him of taking too soft a line with Brussels. Pro-Brexit newspapers have this week called for him to be sacked.

“I understand that passions are high, I understand that people have very strong views about this, but we are all going to the same place, we all have the same agenda,” he said in the interview on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.

“The enemy, the opponents, are out there on the other side of the table. Those are the people that we have to negotiate with. We have to negotiate hard to get the very best deal for Britain,” Hammond said.

Shortly afterwards, Hammond sought to limit the damage.

“In an interview today I was making the point that we are united at home. I regret I used a poor choice of words,” he wrote on Twitter. “We will work with our friends and partners in the EU on a mutually beneficial Brexit deal.”

Hammond infuriated pro-Brexit newspapers this week and was criticised by some Conservatives, including former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, for not agreeing to spend money now on preparations for the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal.

Speaking to media in Washington on Friday, Hammond declined to say whether he would vote for Brexit if there were a second referendum. Hammond who campaigned for Britain to remain part of the EU ahead of the June 2016 vote.

Echoing Prime Minister Theresa May’s own reticence on the issue, Hammond declined to say how he would vote if another referendum were held now. “We’ve had the referendum,” he told the BBC. “You know how I voted in it.”

Earlier this week May declined to answer a similar question, stoking concerns among Brexit supporters that she is not fully committed to taking Britain out of the EU.

On Thursday May’s spokeswoman said the prime minister had full confidence in her Chancellor.

Hammond was forced into another U-turn earlier this year, when he dropped a plan to increase social security contributions by self-employed workers after uproar among Conservative lawmakers who said it broke a 2015 election promise.","Hammond regrets calling EU ""the enemy"" over Brexit",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-imf-g20-britain/hammond-regrets-calling-eu-the-enemy-over-brexit-idUKKBN1CI1Z0

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

So close to home, and if you compare how our fundraising has dropped off with each one of these successive disasters. We have seen some evidence of donor fatigue, yes."" 14:46:54 World Vision took in $1.1 million in the ten day period after Harvey hit Texas. Ten days after Irma whiplashed Florida, it collected $657,000. Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, pulled in $416,000. And the earthquake, $340,000. In other words, successive collections took in roughly 40 percent less than the one before it. The coffers also got lighter at the American Red Cross and AmeriCares. The Red Cross raised nearly $400 million in donations and pledges for Harvey, $56 million for Irma, and $22 million for Maria. The reduced fundraising could curb the ability of aid organizations to provide longer-term support.

Shadia Bseiso, a Jordanian versed in jiu-jitsu, dreams of encouraging more Arab women to take up sports - and of one day maybe even crashing a metal chair over WWE mega-star John Cena.

“Female athletes are finally getting the credit they deserve. The world is more open to that, and in terms of how the region will react to it, I‘m hoping its going to be very positive,” said Bseiso.

While women exercising in public is rare in the Arab world and the local entertainment industry often relegates them to docile roles, big companies such as Nike have stepped up advertising geared towards female athletes.

Still, the high octane physicality and outrageous storylines of professional wrestling remain a novelty in the region.

Speaking to Reuters in the WWE’s Dubai office, Bseiso said she made sure to tell her parents about her colourful career choice in person.

After announcing she would join the ranks of the WWE, they paused in disbelief for a moment, she said, worried for her safety in the often bruising shows.

They support her fully, she added, as she now heads to the company’s Orlando, Florida, training centre for gruelling in-ring training and what WWE calls “character development” - transformation into one of their trademark big personalities.

She has a Jordan-themed persona in mind, she says, declining to elaborate.

For decades a quintessential if curious emblem of Americana, professional wrestling has now won die-hard fans in the Arab world and beyond, and features widely in apparel and toys.

WWE’s reach deeper into new demographics makes plenty of business sense for the $1.5 billion Connecticut company, which has also recently signed several Indian and Chinese athletes in the hope of snaring millions of potential new devotees.

“Recruiting Shadia to join our developmental system underscores WWE’s ongoing commitment to building a talent roster as diverse as our fan base,” said Paul “Triple H” Levesque, WWE Executive Vice President and himself a popular wrestler.

Bseiso insists the quirky genre has room to expand if only fans could find a hero from home.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Nach mehreren vergeblichen Anläufen hat der Dax am Donnerstagnachmittag zwar die 13.000-Punkte-Marke geknackt.

Doch Euphorie hat er damit bei den Anlegern nicht ausgelöst. “Die politischen Krisen sind ja nicht alle auf einmal verschwunden”, sagte ein Händler. Zudem fürchten einige, die Rally sei übertrieben. Viele Experten rechneten aber damit, dass die gut laufenden Geschäfte der großen Unternehmen den deutschen Leitindex noch weiter in die Höhe hieven werden.

Mit rund 12.983 Punkten schloss der Dax unter dem zeitweise aufgestellten neuen Rekord von 13.002 Zählern. Damit lag das Plus zum Vorabend bei 0,1 Prozent. Der EuroStoxx50 kam ebenfalls kaum vom Fleck. Auch an der Wall Street traten die großen Indizes Dow Jones, S&P500 und Nasdaq zum Handelsschluss in Europa auf der Stelle - das allerdings teils ebenfalls auf höchstem Niveau. Schon seit Wochen hangeln sie sich in kleinen Mini-Schritten von Rekord zu Rekord.

Der Sprung des Dax über die 13.000-Punkte-Hürde kam am Donnerstag für die meisten Börsianer zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend. Denn es fehlte ihrer Ansicht nach an echten neuen Impulsen. “Von Euphorie ist hier keine Spur”, kommentierte ein Händler den Dax-Anstieg. Die enge Handelsspanne der vergangenen Tage deute aber darauf hin, dass der endgültige Ausbruch über 13.000 Punkte in den kommenden Tagen recht dynamisch verlaufen könnte, mutmaßte Jochen Stanzl, Analyst beim Broker CMC Markets.

Auslöser der Käufe am Donnerstag war laut Händlern der etwas nachgebende Euro. Die Gemeinschaftswährung verlor zeitweise nach einem unerwartet starken Anstieg der US-Produzentenpreise etwa einen viertel US-Cent auf 1,1840 Dollar. Die zuletzt rückläufigen Zinserwartungen in den USA seien womöglich verfrüht gewesen, erklärte Helaba-Analyst Ralf Umlauf.

Den Anlegern am deutschen Aktienmarkt nahm dies die Sorgen vor einem hohen Wechselkurs, der die Export-Chancen der Unternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt mindert. Noch Anfang der Woche hatte die Krise in Katalonien den Euro belastet und damit den Dax bis auf wenige Zähler an die 13.000er Marke geschoben. Doch nach dem vorläufigen Verzicht Kataloniens auf die Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit hatte der Euro seinen Aufwärtstrend wieder aufgenommen und noch am Vormittag mit 1,1880 Dollar ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch erreicht.

DUBAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is considering the sale of a stake to a Chinese investor as plans for its highly-anticipated international public offering are pushed beyond its 2018 target, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The initial public offering is expected to be the world’s largest stock sale, and is a key component of the Saudi government’s economic reform program which aims to diversify the desert kingdom away from its reliance on oil exports.

A private placement of shares in the state oil company to a Chinese investor is being evaluated as a precursor to the international IPO, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was not public.

They declined to name the investor or how much of Aramco would be sold.

The move would provide Saudi Arabia with cash to help implement the National Transformation Program (NTP), as the reform package is formally known, according to one of the sources.

The NTP comprises a number of difficult economic adjustments for Saudi Arabia - including removing some state subsidies and raising taxes - that are aimed at taming huge budget deficits caused by lower oil prices.

Concerns about the impact of the austerity measures on the economy are rising. While data earlier this month showed the deficit was shrinking, the Saudi economy entered recession in the second quarter, consumer prices are falling and unemployment among Saudis is at 12.8 percent.

A Saudi Aramco spokesman said: “A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track.”

LISTING

Aramco’s dual listing on the Saudi stock market, Tadawul, and an international exchange had been earmarked for 2018 by the Saudi authorities - with stock markets in New York, London and Asia all vying for the offering.

A decision on which exchange would secure the offering has still not been made, with top members of the Saudi royal family preferring New York and Aramco’s financial and legal advisers advocating London.

Both venues have political issues which have caused the Saudis unease and delayed the location decision, according to a third source familiar with the matter.

The U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), passed in September 2016, allowed lawsuits to proceed against the Saudi government claiming it had helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and should pay damages to victims. Riyadh denies the allegations.

Meanwhile, London’s markets regulator has been criticized for proposing new listing rules aimed at attracting state-controlled companies such as Aramco, which some U.K. industry groups have warned would weaken investor protection.

The third source added an international IPO beyond 2018 was still very much an option, while a Tadawul listing was on track for 2018, pointing to comments from senior Saudi officials, such as those made in Moscow earlier this month.

“These members have shown incredible courage and strength by standing up for good jobs and a secure future for their families and their community,” Jerry Dias, president of Unifor National, the main union leading the contract talks, said in a statement.

“This strike has shown all of Canada why a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement must address the needs of working people first,” he said.

The agreement is subject to member ratification, and Unifor said details of the deal will not be released until after the vote is held. The ratification vote has not yet been scheduled.

This week, the dispute ratcheted up when GM warned the union that it would start winding down production at the CAMI plant and ramp up output of the popular Equinox SUV at two plants in Mexico unless workers called off their strike.

The union had blamed NAFTA and Mexico’s cheaper labor costs for job losses.

GM moved production of the Terrain SUV to Mexico this year, resulting in about 400 layoffs at CAMI.

Dias said on Thursday that GM had ”declared war on Canada,“ and called the labor dispute ”the poster child of what’s wrong with NAFTA.

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Lo riferiscono tre fonti a conoscenza della situazione.

Sull‘entità del possibile ritocco, le fonti ipotizzano un range tra 17,5 e 18 euro rispetto ai 16,5 euro della componente cash dell‘offerta annunciata a maggio. Con un rialzo del prezzo, dice una delle fonti, la parte carta dell‘offerta perderebbe di senso e l‘operazione potrebbe assumere una connotazione prevalentemente cash.

Occorrerà vedere se la contro offerta del gruppo guidato dal madrileno Florentino Peres verrà effettivamente lanciata -- il termine secondo la legge spagnola è giovedì 19 - - e se il prezzo sarà in linea ai 17 euro per azione indicato dalle indiscrezioni.

Secondo alcune fonti sentite da Reuters, l‘offerta Acs sarà circa per metà in contanti e per il resto in azioni di nuova emissione del gruppo tedesco Hochtief, controllato da Acs per oltre il 70%.

Una volta arrivato il rilancio, secondo le norme spagnole la situazione su Abertis verrà congelata fino a che la Cnmv, l‘autorità di mercato spagnola, non avrà approvato l‘operazione concorrente. Solo a quel punto, probabilmente a qualche mese di distanza, Atlantia sarà libera di fare il suo rilancio.

Un prezzo fino a 18 euro, dice una delle fonti, è assolutamente sostenibile per rating e livello debito.

“La sensazione è che l‘offerta di Acs, se si concretizzerà secondo le indiscrezioni, sia stata pensata per guadagnare tempo e cristalizzare la situazione, con eventuali ritocchi migliorativi in un secondo tempo”, osserva una seconda fonte.

Dopo l‘annuncio quasi 5 mesi fa, il via libera della Consob spagnola ad Atlantia risale al 9 ottobre.

L‘offerta, partita il 10, è in corso fino al 24 ottobre. E’ subordinata al raggiungimento almeno del 50% più una azione Abertis con adesioni per un minimo del 10,1% del capitale di Abertis all‘offerta in carta.

Atlantia offre a tutti gli azionisti Abertis 16,50 euro in contanti per il 77% del capitale e per il restante 23% un concambio con titoli Atlantia speciali, non trasferibili fino al 15 febbraio 2019 e da quel momento convertiti automaticamente in azioni ordinarie Atlantia alla pari.

Il consiglio di amministrazione di Abertis, entro un termine massimo di dieci giorni di calendario dall‘inizio dell‘offerta, pubblicherà la propria relazione sull‘Offerta, che Atlantia ha sempre presentato come amichevole.

Il principale azionista di Abertis è Criteria Caixa, braccio finanziario della potente fondazione bancaria che controlla la più grande banca catalana Caixabank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Under the once-vaunted “keiretsu” system of close, trust-based ties between manufacturers and suppliers, “Made-in-Japan” became a byword for industrial quality and reliability.

That reputation has eroded over recent years.

Kobe Steel (5406.T) is just the latest in a string of corporate scandals involving data tampering and other methods of cheating to tarnish the Japan Inc quality stamp.

It may be a sign that the government’s push to improve corporate governance is seeing greater disclosure of wrongdoing.

But the root cause is more likely that Japanese manufacturers are failing modern compliance standards as they grapple with a shrinking domestic market and increased global competition.

As the focus has shifted to market mechanisms instead of cosy relationship-based arrangements, Japanese manufacturers have had to compete on price and expand their client base.

“Growing global competition has forced Japanese manufacturers to cut costs to be more efficient, while fulfilling a production quota which is often difficult to achieve,” said Motokazu Endo, a lawyer at Tokyo Kasumigaseki law office.

The “keiretsu” system was the bedrock of Japan’s automotive industry. As the market has become more competition based, those automakers now invest less money in their suppliers and spend less time checking what those suppliers’ factories are producing, says Hitoshi Kaise, an auto industry consultant and partner at Roland Berger.

Beyond that, Japan’s economy has suffered decades of anaemic growth, bogged down in deflation with its population shrinking and with growing competition from its Asian neighbours.

Those pressures have potentially whittled away at Japanese firms’ ability to compete, says Hideaki Miyajima, a Waseda University professor and corporate governance expert.

“GONE TOO FAR”

The list of manufacturer miscreants is long, and growing.

Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) has had to recall every new car it sold in Japan in the last three years after it falsified safety checks.

Both Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) have faced scandals over fuel economy tests on their vehicles, and there was wrongdoing by the now bankrupt air bag maker Takata, Toyo Tire & Rubber Co (5105.T) and Asahi Kasei Corp (3407.T).

“While focusing on targets was right in the beginning it has gone too far, with companies that can’t hit their targets resorting to deception,” says Hiroshi Osada, a production quality expert and Bunkyo University professor.

Over the last 15 years compliance rules have become stricter but many Japanese companies have carried on with practices common in the past, says Nobuo Gohara, a lawyer specialising in compliance, who took part in an audit of Olympus Corp (7733.T) after its accounting scandal in 2011.

“There are many of these problems lying dormant on the factory floor,” he said.

Japan runs the risk it will “lose out as other Asian economies, including China, progressively raise their standards of quality and reliability,” said Professor Thomas Clarke, a corporate governance expert at the University of Technology in Sydney.

BETTER BOARDS

And it’s not just dodgy data.

Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling an accounting scandal, and there is a litany of wrongdoing at Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) (9501.T), the operator of the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex.

Just this week, Japan’s nuclear regulator said Japan Nuclear Fuel had violated safety rules at its Rokkasho site by fabricating records to say safety checks had been carried out. The plant’s start data has been delayed 23 times.

Even when moves are taken to strengthen external monitoring of companies, “it’s not possible to conduct checks day in, day out,” said Osada at Bunkyo University, who sat on an external panel that audited Toyota during its 2010 recall crisis.

Companies must do more to develop a culture in which workers are able to raise concerns and say ‘no’ to their bosses, and in which teamwork is used to catch wrongdoing by other employees, Osada added.

More attention should be focused on Japan’s board members, who are not active enough in engaging with scandals when they occur, says Shin Ushijima, lawyer and president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network, noting a tendency for companies to be over-reliant on appointing outside panels that are not truly independent.

Corporate governance reforms are having some impact, says Ushijima. At Toshiba, he said, “the board, while not perfect, was improved after it was reshuffled.”",Kobe Steel scandal latest to expose 'Made-in-Japan' fault-lines,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-kobe-steel-scandal-quality-analysis/kobe-steel-scandal-latest-to-expose-made-in-japan-fault-lines-idUKKBN1CI25P

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market’s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P .SPX, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017’s rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

“If it’s just a mean-reversion trade, then it’s probably going to last another few weeks and then we’re back to the old winners,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If it’s something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that.”

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), railroads CSX Corp (CSX.O) and Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) and steel company Nucor Corp (NUE.N) stand to yield insight into the economy’s health.

September’s stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September’s stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

“In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump’s election,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States .CESIUSD, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent.

“We’ve just had better data,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index .BADI.

“Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,” Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials (XLF.P), industrials (XLI.P) and energy (XLE.P), and outflows for technology (XLK.P) and healthcare (XLV.P), according to Lipper data.

“There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth ”hasn’t been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings.”

“For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year,” Warne said.",Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-weekahead/wall-street-weekahead-cyclical-sector-rally-banks-on-global-economic-expansion-idINKBN1CI1D5

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Sunday called for calm less than 24 hours ahead of a deadline from Spain’s central government for him to clarify whether he has declared independence for Catalonia or not.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Politicians from North and South Korea will not hold direct talks in Russia on Monday about Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program despite attending the same event, Russian news agencies said on Sunday.

Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Senate upper house of parliament, is due to discuss the issue in separate talks with a deputy head of North Korea’s legislature and the head of South Korea’s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg on Monday, TASS quoted a senior Russian lawmaker as saying on Saturday.

TASS cited a Russian parliamentarian at the time as saying Moscow would call on the two countries to use the opportunity to have direct talks to try to narrow their differences.

But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Korea’s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an Iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of Kirkuk, which controls the access to some of the region’s main oilfields, a Kurdish security official said on Sunday.

Meanwhile, an Iranian military official arrived in Iraq’s Kurdistan region for talks on the growing crisis between the Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government following last month’s Kurdish independence referendum.

Major General Qassem Soleimani is the commander of foreign operations for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards who provide training and guns to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi‘ite-led government in Baghdad, known as Popular Mobilization.

The top Kurdish leadership met on Sunday to discuss the crisis and rejected the Iraqi government’s demand that it cancels the outcome of the independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute.

The vote delivered an overwhelming ‘Yes’ for independence.

The meeting was attended by Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani, Iraqi President Fuad Masum, a Kurd who hold a largely ceremonial position in the Iraqi federal state, and Hero Talabani, the widow of Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani who died this month, a Barzani aide said.

They rejected what they described as “military threats” and pledged to defend Kurdish-held territory in case of an attack.

Popular Mobilization had given the Peshmerga until midnight local time (2100 GMT Saturday) to leave a position north of the Maktab Khalid junction, a security official from the Kurdistan Regional Government said.

Ali al-Hussaini, a spokesman for the paramilitary groups known as Hashid Shaabi in Arabic, told Reuters the deadline had expired without giving indications about their next move. “We are waiting for new orders. No extension is expected,” he said.

The Kurdish position north of the junction controls the access to an important airbase and Bai Hassan, one of the region’s main crude oil fields, the KRG official said.

The city, the airbase and their immediate surroundings, including the oilfields, are under Kurdish control.

There were no clashes reported 17 hours after the deadline but tension remained high with both sides mobilized.

KURDS SEE IRAQI “THREATS”

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Shi‘ite-led central government in Baghdad are at loggerheads since the Sept. 25 vote and its loud call for Kurdish independence.

Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront Iraqi “threats.” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the Kurds.

Popular Mobilization is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to Abadi. It is deployed alongside the army south and west of Kirkuk.

Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk’s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.

The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its vote for independence, including banning international flights in and out.

Baghdad’s tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbors Turkey and Iran - both with their own sizeable Kurdish minorities, and in Turkey’s case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency.

In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the situation had the full attention of the United States, which was working to ensure it does not escalate.

PÉTROLE ET GAZ NATUREL

* Total est le premier géant pétrolier à avoir signé un accord avec l‘Iran, en novembre 2016, et a accepté de l‘aider à développer son plus grand gisement de gaz naturel, South Pars, dans le Golfe persique.

* L‘anglo-néerlandaise Shell a emboîté le pas à la société française en décembre 2016 en concluant un accord pour développer les gisements pétroliers et gaziers de Yadavaran, South Azadegan et Kish.

* Téhéran a établi une liste de 29 sociétés étrangères autorisées à signer un nouveau type de contrat, moins contraignant, pour des projets d‘exploitations de pétrole et de gaz naturel.

Parmi ces entreprises figurent Total et Shell, mais aussi l‘italienne Eni, la malaisienne Petronas, les russes Gazprom et Lukoil, ainsi que des sociétés en Chine, au Japon, en Autriche et dans d‘autres pays.

Le premier appel d‘offres, portant sur le développement du plus grand gisement pétrolier iranien, Azadegan, a cependant été repoussé à plusieurs reprises, sans explication, et ne devrait pas avoir lieu d‘ici la fin de l‘année.

* Des protocoles d‘accord pour des contrats pétroliers et gaziers, allant de l‘exploitation à la modernisation des oléoducs et des raffineries, ont été signés avec plusieurs sociétés étrangères, dont les norvégiennes Aker Solutions et DNO, l‘autrichienne OMV, l‘allemande BASF, l‘italienne Saipem ou encore la sud-coréenne Daewoo Engineering and Construction.

AVIATION

* L‘Iran a dévoilé un plan de modernisation de sa flotte d‘avions vieillissante et de modernisation des infrastructures aéroportuaires.

* La compagnie nationale IranAir a commandé 100 appareils à Airbus et en a déjà réceptionné trois.

* Boeing a aussi signé un contrat portant sur la livraison de 80 avions.

* Des banquiers avaient déjà émis des doutes sur la capacité de financement de ces contrats en raison du risque de nouvelles sanctions contre l‘Iran, avant même que Donald Trump ne remette en cause l‘accord sur le nucléaire.

* Le constructeur européen ATR, codétenu par Airbus et l‘italien Leonardo, a conclu la vente de 20 avions à IranAir, qui a déjà pris livraison de six appareils pour assurer des liaisons régionales.

“He (Kurz) is an HC Strache impersonator,” Strache said.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria holds a parliamentary election on Sunday in which a young conservative star hopes to beat the far right at its own game with a hard line on refugees and pledging to prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who is just 31, propelled his conservative People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became its leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party from the spot it had held for more than a year. He is now the clear favourite to become Austria’s next leader.

Kurz has pledged to shut down migrants’ main routes into Europe, through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. Many voters now feel the country was overrun when it threw open its borders in 2015 to a wave of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Chancellor Christian Kern’s Social Democrats (SPO) are currently in coalition with Kurz’s OVP, but Kurz called an end to the alliance when he took over the helm of his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Opinion polls have consistently shown the OVP in the lead with around a third of the vote, and second place being a tight race between the Social Democrats and the Freedom Party (FPO), whose candidate came close to winning last year’s presidential election.

“We must stop illegal immigration to Austria because otherwise there will be no more order and security,” Kurz told tabloid daily Oesterreich on Friday night.

Campaigning has been dominated by the immigration issue. Kurz plans to cap benefit payments for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by a coalition between his party and the Social Democrats.

Kurz’s opponents say he is merely a new face on an old party that has been in power in various coalitions for 30 straight years.

As campaigning drew to a close over the weekend, the leaders of all three top parties warned voters to be sceptical about polling in an effort to improve their turnout.

“You should not pay attention to opinion polls. You should instead go by the atmosphere here,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache said in front of cheering supporters at a shopping mall in Vienna on Saturday, adding that only Sunday’s vote counted.

LAST DASH

With little daylight between Kurz and the FPO on immigration, the FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas.

“He (Kurz) is an HC Strache impersonator,” Strache said.

Kern and his Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish, having been sent into a tailspin two weeks ago by a smear scandal that forced their chairman to step down.

“You must go out now, go to your neighbours, go into bars, go to your friends and tell them what is at stake,” Kern told a party rally in Vienna on Saturday, depicting Kurz as the candidate of the rich and powerful.

“If you do that, I guarantee you we will make a success of this election,” he said, warning of a repeat of the coalition between the OVP and Freedom Party in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The winner of the election is traditionally tasked with forming a government, which will most likely require a coalition with one of the two other main parties. With Kurz and Kern at loggerheads, the FPO has a good chance of being kingmaker.

Three smaller parties are polling between 4 percent -- the threshold for entering parliament -- and 6 percent.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT), with the first projections due minutes later. A final count is expected later in the evening.

Any tight margins might not be settled on the night, however, since a record number of postal ballots have been issued -- even more than in the presidential run-off in May of last year, in which they swung the result, though a re-run was later ordered.

The Interior Ministry said more than 889,000 postal ballots had been issued, enough for roughly a seventh of the 6.4 million registered voters.

The counting of those ballots will not begin until Monday. They can also be cast in polling stations, including ones where the voter is not registered.",Europe's migration crisis casts long shadow as Austria votes,https://www.reuters.com/article/austria-election/europes-migration-crisis-casts-long-shadow-as-austria-votes-idINKBN1CK02M?il=0

“I hope it is enough (to win).”Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that is expected to see 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz become chancellor on a pledge to take a hard line on refugees and prevent a repeat of Europe’s migration crisis.

Foreign Minister Kurz propelled his People’s Party (OVP) to the top of opinion polls when he became leader in May, dislodging the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) that had held first place for more than a year.

If Kurz’s OVP wins, the FPO would still have a good chance of entering government for the first time in more than a decade.

The winner will probably need a coalition to govern and the FPO could be kingmaker because the OVP and their current coalition partner, the Social Democrats, are at loggerheads.

Austria, a wealthy country of 8.7 million people that stretches from Slovakia to Switzerland, was a gateway into Germany for more than 1 million people during the migration crisis that began in 2015. Many of them were fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Austria also took in roughly 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015, one of the highest proportions on the continent. Many voters say the country was overrun.

“Immigration policy, which Mr Kurz talked about so often, was decisive,” 58-year-old Kurz supporter Ingrid Regina said outside a polling station in Vienna on a warm, sunny autumn day. “I expect things to improve and order to return.”

The inflow of migrants buoyed the FPO and similar anti-immigration parties across Europe, including the Alternative for Germany party, which secured seats in parliament last month.

The FPO, by contrast, has been in Austria’s parliament for decades and currently holds a fifth of seats there.

“I am hoping for a good result with a greater vote of confidence,” FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters at a polling stating in Vienna. “If we reach 25 percent that would be good, a great success, but perhaps even more is possible.”

Kurz says he will shut the main migrant routes into Europe through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean. He and the FPO have kept immigration at the heart of the campaign, while Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern has touted falling unemployment and the fastest economic growth in six years.

Kurz plans to cap benefits for refugees at well below the general level and bar other foreigners from receiving such payments until they have lived in the country for five years.

He also says he wants to shake up Austrian politics, which for decades has been dominated by coalitions between his party and the Social Democrats. His opponents say he is merely a new face on a party in power in various coalitions for 30 years.

“LAST HOPE”

“He is our last Christian-social hope,” said Kurz supporter Thomas Heine-Geldern, a retired consultant. He was expressing a view that helped Kurz gain control of the OVP, namely that he is its only chance of bringing electoral success to an otherwise ageing and fading party. “I hope it is enough (to win).”

Kurz ended the current alliance with the Social Democrats when he took over his party, forcing Sunday’s snap election.

Opinion polls have for months shown the conservatives ahead with around a third of the vote and a tight race for second between the Social Democrats and the FPO, whose candidate nearly won last year’s presidential election.

The FPO has accused Kurz of copying its ideas and Strache called him an “impersonator.”

The Social Democrats are hoping for a strong finish to make voters forget a scandal that plunged the party into turmoil two weeks ago when their chairman was forced to step down.

The party said it was connected to Facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against Kurz, blaming a political adviser Kern had hired. The party leadership has said it was unaware of the party’s involvement and has launched an internal investigation.

“We are full of optimism. Now the voters have to decide. I think we have led a campaign in the last few days that has gained significant momentum,” Kern told reporters after casting his ballot in Vienna.

He has warned of a repeat of the OVP-Freedom Party coalition in the early 2000s that was marked by financial scandals.

The last polling stations close at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) and the first projections are due minutes later.

The IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook raised its growth forecast for the world economy to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent. But it lowered India’s economic growth for 2017 and 2018, citing the lingering impact of demonetization and Goods and Services Tax (GST).

The World Bank has also lowered its India growth projection and expects FY18 growth rate to be 7 percent. The World Bank noted that the most substantial medium-term risks are associated with private investment recovery, which continues to face several domestic impediments.

On the GST front, the finance minister said that there was a strong case to bring the real estate sector under the ambit of GST as the maximum amount of tax evasion takes place in this sector. Separately, the government said it will review items falling under the highest tax slab of 28 percent after three months with an aim to rationalise rates on goods of mass consumption. The review will be subject to revenue implications any change in rates will have on government finances.

On the macro data front, IIP grew to a 9-month high of 4.3 percent in August as restocking of manufactured items gained momentum after the initial blip caused by GST implementation. A higher-than-expected demand on account of an early festival season also bolstered factory output. September CPI inflation remained static at 3.28 percent. India’s trade deficit narrowed in September as gold imports declined for the first time since January.

Globally, reports suggest that the ECB may reduce its bond purchases to €30 billion per month from January and simultaneously extend the duration of the QE programme by another nine months to at least September 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve released the minutes of its September FOMC meeting and it was the reaffirmation of a widely expected December interest rate hike, despite the Fed’s concerns about low inflation.

GIC IPO, the largest in recent times, got a lukewarm response, despite being reasonably priced. The issue had an overall subscription of 1.37x with QIBs at 2.25x whereas the rest of the categories were under-subscribed. LIC accounted for over 50 percent of the bids.

The coming week is a truncated one as trading will be shut for two days on account of Diwali. The markets on Monday are expected to react to Q2 numbers of Reliance Industries which were a mixed bag. The GRM was lower than expected at $12 although higher than the previous quarter. The EBITDA margins and PetChem margins were much better than expected. A surprise was the meagre loss of 2.71 billion rupees for the Jio business where analysts were expecting a much bigger loss. The result season has picked up steam and the frontline companies set to announce their numbers this week include ACC, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Wipro and UltraTech. Expect some good numbers initially.

On the macro front, the government will announce WPI inflation data for September on Monday. The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister has advised him to stick to the fiscal consolidation route and that no stimulus package should be at the cost of fiscal prudence. With various state polls lined up before the 2019 election, I wonder how the government would provide various goodies as well as shore up the economy without sacrificing fiscal prudence.

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Sunday called for calm less than 24 hours ahead of a deadline from Spain’s central government for him to clarify whether he has declared independence for Catalonia or not.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has not been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Sunday that if article 155 was invoked, the government would replace the Catalan government with a new set-up to manage the region autonomously, which could be run by politicians or technocrats. Within three months, elections would be held.",Catalan leader calls for calm ahead of Madrid deadline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/catalan-leader-calls-for-calm-ahead-of-madrid-deadline-idUSKBN1CK0J3?il=0

Düsseldorf (Reuters) - Der Streit zwischen dem Energiekonzern Uniper und der früheren Mutter E.ON über den Verkauf der restlichen Uniper-Anteile an den finnischen Versorger Fortum eskaliert.

Uniper-Betriebsratschef Harald Seegatz warf E.ON-Chef Johannes Teyssen in der “Bild am Sonntag” Wortbruch vor. “E.ON nimmt für sich in Anspruch, aufrichtig und ehrlich zu handeln. Und nun halten sich die Manager nicht an das, was sie uns allen immer wieder versprochen haben.” E.ON will sein Uniper-Restpaket von 47 Prozent Anfang 2018 für 3,8 Milliarden Euro an Fortum verkaufen. Uniper fürchtet um seine Eigenständigkeit und sieht die Pläne als feindlichen Übernahmeversuch der Finnen.

E.ON wies den Vorwurf zurück. Man habe nie Zweifel daran gelassen, dass die Uniper-Anteile ab Anfang 2018 verkauft werden sollen, hieß es in einer Stellungnahme. Mit Fortum seien als Vorbedingung für die Veräußerung Zusagen für die Mitarbeiter von Uniper vereinbart worden. Fortum habe Uniper zu Gesprächen eingeladen, wie die Zusagen formalisiert werden können. “Es ist bedauerlich, dass Vertreter von Uniper bislang nicht in Gespräche mit Fortum eintreten wollen und stattdessen die eigenen Mitarbeiter verunsichert werden.”

Betriebsratschef Seegatz bezeichnete den Verkauf an Fortum als “überstürzten Deal”. Es falle schwer zu glauben, dass der nichts mit der kürzlich beschlossenen Vertragsverlängerung Teyssens zu tun habe, sagte Seegatz der “Bild am Sonntag”. “Die bekommt er nun für drei Jahre, obwohl er gleichzeitig Tausende Jobs aufs Spiel setzt und uns ins Ungewisse übergibt. Jobs von den Menschen, die ihn groß gemacht haben.” Uniper beschäftigt 13.000 Mitarbeiter, davon rund 5000 in Deutschland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund members gave lukewarm endorsement to a strengthening global economy but conceded they were not out of the woods as they grappled with subdued inflation, low potential growth and an uneven recovery that clouded the outlook.

With central banks left with less firepower and some seeking to exit crisis-mode stimulus measures, the IMF members also renewed calls for fiscal policy and structural reforms to carry more of the burden in solidifying the recovery, now that the worst days of the economic storm had passed.

“Structural reforms that were difficult to do in hard times would be much easier in better times because the outlook is stronger,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Saturday.

“It’s when the sun is shining that you need to fix the roof. That message was received 100 percent (by the policymakers).”

A communique from the IMF’s steering body, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), said a global economic upswing, driven by a pickup in investment, trade and factory output, was brightening the outlook.

But it warned policymakers against complacency, saying that the recovery was “not yet complete” with inflation below target and potential growth weak in many countries.

Financial leaders attending the meeting also warned that while economies had improved in many countries there were people who had been left behind.

“We’re still an economy with our head in the oven and our feet in the freezer. So for the people with their feet in the freezer, that doesn’t resonate with them if you say everything’s on track,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.

PATIENCE NEEDED

The optimism on global growth was overshadowed by tensions on trade, which was in full show in contentious talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) held during the IMF’s autumn meetings.

The communique made no mention of trade, though Lagarde sought to offer a bright note by saying it was “perfectly legitimate” to renew long-standing trade agreements to respond to a changing world.

“Trade is a very powerful engine of growth, innovation, competition and productivity ... Hopefully if it is well done, it can be a win-win for all countries in those negotiations,” she said, when asked about the NAFTA talks.

The communique said member countries agreed to work together to reduce “excessive global imbalances,” and to look more carefully at potential side-effects that prolonged low interest rates could have on asset prices and economic activity.

Policymakers also had less to cheer on inflation and wages, which remain weak despite a strengthening recovery that prompted the IMF to upgrade its global growth forecast.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that while subdued price and wage growth has become a common phenomenon in advanced economies, it was ”only a question of time“ for them to accelerate as the economy gathers momentum.”

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said the key was patience.

“The bottom line in terms of policy is that we are confident that as the conditions will continue to improve, the inflation rate will gradually converge in a self-sustained manner,” he said.

“But together with our confidence, we should also be patient because it’s going to take time.”",Global policymakers grapple with half-baked recovery short of wage growth,https://in.reuters.com/article/imf-g20/global-policymakers-grapple-with-half-baked-recovery-short-of-wage-growth-idINKBN1CK029

For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - British Prime Theresa May’s energy plan has few political merits and even fewer economic ones. Her government said on Thursday it will cap the most commonly used energy prices until 2020 to ensure consumers pay less. The intention is laudable, but the biggest intervention since Britain privatised its energy industry three decades ago may do more harm than good.

Britons pay one of the lowest rates in western Europe per unit of energy consumed, according to Eurostat. Adjust for purchasing power differences, and they pay one of the lowest rates across the whole European Union (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xBuOB2). That may be because Britain has more major energy suppliers than most other EU countries and is one of a minority where the combined market share of the three largest suppliers is below 70 percent, according to Europe’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (see graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xxrTsV).

Many consumers are not benefiting from competition, though. Two-thirds of UK households pay so-called standard variable tariffs even though they could save money by moving to cheaper fixed-rate deals. Inertia, fears that changing providers is complex, and a fuzzy idea of potential savings may explain why regulator Ofgem found that less a fifth of customers switched suppliers last year. May calls the market “broken”.

Putting a limit on standard variable tariffs may not lead to a better outcome, though. Granted, an energy cap will in the short term cut most consumers’ bills. But a 2014 ACER report found that a regulated price acts as a gravitational force around which competing suppliers cluster. A cap therefore risks compressing the range of available tariffs and could push up prices if weaker competitors are squeezed out of the market.

Politics sometimes explain decisions that economics cannot. But May’s plan is politically flawed as well. The opposition Labour Party proposed a cap before the 2015 elections and has since gone further by talking of renationalising the energy industry.

There are better options. For example, regulators could force energy companies to put consumers on the cheapest fixed-rate tariff by default. Suppliers could also be required to inform clients of the cheapest tariff available in the market and savings they could make by switching. The latest intervention may force the industry to change. In the meantime, though, a price cap could hurt those it is supposed to help.",Breakingviews - UK energy cap is bad economics and poor politics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-energy-breakingviews/breakingviews-uk-energy-cap-is-bad-economics-and-poor-politics-idUSKBN1CH22F

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Bob Corker stepped up his public feud with Donald Trump on Friday, saying the U.S. president’s undermining of his top diplomat was like castrating him in public.

Corker told the Washington Post in an interview that Trump had undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s efforts to enlist China in reining in North Korea’s nuclear program by denigrating the diplomat.

“You cannot publicly castrate your own secretary of state” without limiting the options for dealing with North Korea, Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, told the Post.

Tillerson told a news conference in Beijing two weeks ago that the United States was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programs but it had shown no interest in dialogue.

Trump took to Twitter the next day, saying Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

”The greatest diplomatic activities we have are with China, and the most important, and they have come a long, long way,” Corker said.

”Some of the things we are talking about are phenomenal.”

“When you jack the legs out from under your chief diplomat, you cause all that to fall apart,” Corker told the Post, adding that working with China was the key to reaching a peaceful settlement with North Korea.

Clinton also said Britain would be at a “very big disadvantage” if divorce negotiations with the EU failed, and went on to compare the factors behind the Brexit vote to her own election loss.

Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

He accused Iran of “not living up to the spirit” of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon, in effect throwing the fate of the deal to Congress.

He singled out Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of Tehran, which he accused of destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.

“We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said.

Trump’s hardline remarks drew praise from Israel, Iran’s arch-foe, but was criticized by European allies.

The move by Trump was part of his “America First” approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

His Iran strategy angered Tehran and put Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with Iran.

Responding to Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday on television that Tehran was committed to the deal and accused Trump of making baseless accusations.

“The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure,” he said. “Iran and the deal are stronger than ever.”

European allies have warned of a split with the United States over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as Trump has done undermines U.S. credibility abroad, especially as international inspectors say Iran is in compliance with the accord.

The chief of the U.N. atomic watchdog reiterated that Iran was under the world’s “most robust nuclear verification regime.”

“The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,” Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, referring to the deal by its formal name.

U.S. Democrats expressed skepticism at Trump’s decision. Senator Ben Cardin said: “At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners.”

CONGRESS DECIDES

While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker was working on amending the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act law to include “trigger points” that if crossed by Iran would automatically reimpose U.S. sanctions.

Slideshow (10 Images)

The trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections, Iran’s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal’s “sunset clauses” under which some of the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program expire over time.

Trump directed U.S. intelligence agencies to probe whether Iran might be working with North Korea on its weapons programs.

The president, who took office in January, had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as “the worst deal ever.” It was negotiated under his predecessor, former President Barack Obama.

Trump warned that if “we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.”

“We’ll see what happens over the next short period of time and I can do that instantaneously,” he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now.

The Trump administration designated the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under an executive order targeting terrorists. The administration stopped short of labeling the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a list maintained by the State Department.

The Revolutionary Guard is the single most dominant player in Iran’s security, political, and economic systems and wields enormous influence in Iran’s domestic and foreign policies.

It had already previously been sanctioned by the United States under other authorities, and the immediate impact of Friday’s measure is likely to be symbolic.

The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of Trump’s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of U.S. forces.

But U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet, and Iran had not responded to Trump’s announcement with any provocative acts so far.",Trump strikes blow at Iran nuclear deal in major U.S. policy shift,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa/trump-strikes-blow-at-iran-nuclear-deal-in-major-u-s-policy-shift-idUSKBN1CI24I

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The freeing of a hostage U.S.-Canadian family by Pakistan’s army has been hailed by officials as a positive step in mending ties between Washington and Islamabad, but those hoping fresh start in their fraught relationship seem likely to be disappointed.

Pakistan and the United States have for years been - at best - uneasy allies in the war against the Taliban and other Islamist extremists.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the raid that rescued American Caitlan Campbell, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their three young children showed that Pakistan had started to “respect the United States again” in response to his administration’s tough-talking tactics.

But the two countries still have conflicting interests - and the Trump administration’s vow to apply more diplomatic pressure on Pakistan is unlikely to work, given Islamabad’s growing alliance with regional heavyweight China, say analysts.

“This is a small occurrence between Pakistan and the U.S., and it should not be confused with the big issues that separate Pakistan and the U.S.,” said Pakistani security analyst Imtiaz Gul.

On Friday, five years after they were kidnapped in Afghanistan, Campbell and Boyle flew home with the three children born while they were captives of the Haqqani network, a feared Taliban sub-group that Washington particularly accuses Pakistan of failing to do enough to fight.

Some saw the timing as a goodwill gesture ahead of upcoming visits by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this hostage release was announced when you have a parade of top Trump administration officials in Islamabad to deliver strongly worded warnings to Pakistan,” said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center.

He added that no one should take the good news as a definite sign that Pakistan would drastically change its behaviour towards militants such at the Haqqanis.

“Going after hostages is not the same thing as going after the terrorists holding them,” he said.

The United States has repeatedly accused Pakistan of not doing enough to eliminate militant havens on its territory.

COOPERATION, AND MISTRUST

For now, officials on both sides are talking up the cooperation on display in Wednesday’s rescue operation, when Pakistani troops acting on a U.S. intelligence tip-off swooped on a vehicle carrying the hostages.

But tensions remain.

Pakistan is still angry at the unilateral U.S. operations on its soil to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 and last year’s drone strike that killed Taliban supreme leader Akhtar Mansour.

United States officials, for their part, suspect both bin Laden and Mansour were able to live in Pakistan with the tacit support of at least some elements of the powerful military.

Washington also argues that the Taliban - which has been fighting to re-establish its hardline Islamist regime in Kabul since a 2001 U.S.-backed military intervention - would not have been able to gain so much ground against Afghan government forces in recent years without safe havens in Pakistan.

Trump’s administration in August warned aid to Pakistan might be cut and Washington might downgrade its status as a major non-NATO ally, in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to America’s longest-running war.

Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis, saying they have cooperated for years and launched military operations to push out militants from its soil.

Pakistan also says few appreciate that 17,000 Pakistanis have died fighting militants or in bombings and other attacks since 2001.

REGIONAL RIVALS

Pakistan is less vulnerable to threats of U.S. aid cuts because Islamabad has been deepening its relationship in recent years with China, which is financing some $57 billion in infrastructure projects, said Gul.

Critics say the Pakistani military nurtures the Taliban and other Islamist factions because they are seen as potentially useful to Pakistan’s core confrontation with old rival India.

The Trump administration’s recent talk of a “regional strategy” for Afghanistan that would include a bigger role for India has deeply upset Pakistan’s establishment, said Mosharraf Zaidi, an Islamabad-based commentator and former Pakistan Foreign Ministry adviser.

“It seems like for the U.S., and President Trump has said so, that India is going to be a big part of the future of Afghanistan, and for Pakistan that’s not on the table,” Zaidi said.

As a nuclear power, Pakistan could also be offended further at Trump’s implication that it has bowed to his administration’s pressure.

“Given that people understand that respect for America is a big deal for Trump and a big deal for the American people, it shouldn’t be so hard to understand why Pakistan ... also wants to be respected,” said Zaidi.","Analysis: Pakistan's hostage rescue hailed, but tensions with U.S. remain",https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-afghanistan-kidnapping-usa/analysis-pakistans-hostage-rescue-hailed-but-tensions-with-u-s-remain-idINKBN1CI2H2

One day after his administration announced plans to end the payments next week, Trump said he would dismantle Obamacare “step by step.”

His latest action raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets. The subsidies cost $7 billion this year and were estimated at $10 billion for 2018, according to congressional analysts.

“As far as the subsidies are concerned, I don’t want to make the insurance companies rich,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They’re making a fortune by getting that kind of money.”

Trump’s action took aim at a critical element of the 2010 law, his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Frustrated by the failure of his fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump has taken several steps to chip away at it.

Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging the law.

Democratic attorneys general from the 18 states as well as Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit in federal court in California later on Friday. The states include: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington state.

The states will ask the court to force Trump to make the next payment. Legal experts said the states were likely to face an uphill battle in court.

“His effort to gut these subsidies with no warning or even a plan to contain the fallout is breathtakingly reckless,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. “This is an effort simply to blow up the system.”

Related Coverage Trump says Democratic leaders should come to White House to negotiate healthcare deal

The new lawsuit would be separate from a case pending before an appeals court in the District of Columbia in which 16 Democratic state attorneys general are defending the legality of the payments.

If the subsidies vanish, low-income Americans who obtain insurance through Obamacare online marketplaces where insurers can sell policies would face higher insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs. It would particularly hurt lower-middle-class families whose incomes are still too high to qualify for certain government assistance.

About 10 million people are enrolled in Obamacare through its online marketplaces, and most receive subsidies. Trump’s action came just weeks before the period starting on Nov. 1 when individuals have to begin enrolling for 2018 insurance coverage through the law’s marketplaces.

The administration will not make the next payment to insurers, scheduled for Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism about chances for a deal with Republicans to continue the subsidy payments.

“We’re going to have a very good opportunity to get this done in a bipartisan way” during negotiations in December on broad federal spending legislation, “if we can’t get it done sooner,” Schumer told reporters.

Trump offered an invitation for Democratic leaders to come to the White House, while also lashing out at them. “We’ll negotiate some deal that’s good for everybody. But they’re always a bloc vote against everything. They’re like obstructionists,” Trump told reporters.

The Senate failed in both July and September to pass legislation backed by Trump to repeal Obamacare due to opposition by a handful of Republican senators. One of them, Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who had been contemplating running for governor next year, on Friday said she planned to remain in the Senate and would use her voice in reforming the healthcare system.

SHARES OF INSURERS, HOSPITALS FALL

Hospitals, doctors, health insurers, state insurance commissioners and patient advocates decried Trump’s move, saying consumers will ultimately pay the price. They called on Congress to appropriate the funds needed to keep up the subsidy payments.

Shares of U.S. hospital companies and health insurers closed down on Friday after the subsidies announcement. Centene Corp (CNC.N) closed down 3.3 percent and Molina Healthcare (MOH.N) closed down 3.4 percent. Among hospital shares, Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) finished 5.1 percent lower and Community Health Systems (CYH.N) declined 4.0 percent.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that erasing the subsidies would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion over the next decade because the government still would be obligated under other parts of Obamacare to help lower-income people pay for insurance premiums.

Trump, who as a candidate last year promised to roll back the law formally called the Affordable Care Act, received applause for his latest action during an appearance on Friday before a group of conservative voters.

“It’s step by step by step, and that was a very big step yesterday,” Trump said. “And one by one, it’s going to come down, and we’re going to have great healthcare in our country.”

Earlier on Twitter he called Obamacare “a broken mess” that is “imploding,” and referred to the “pet insurance companies” of Democrats.

Republicans for seven years had vowed to get rid of Obamacare, but deep intra-party divisions have scuttled their efforts to get legislation through the Senate, where they hold a slim majority.

Since taking office in January, Trump threatened many times to cut the subsidies. Health insurers that planned to stay in the Obamacare market prepared for the move in many states by submitting two sets of premium rates to regulators: with and without the subsidies.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the change would drive up premium costs for consumers by at least 12 to 15 percent in 2018 and cut more than $1 billion in payments to insurers for 2017.

The White House announced the cut-off just hours after Trump signed an order intended to allow insurers to sell lower-cost, bare-bones policies with limited benefits and consumer protections.

(Reuters) - Australia captain Steve Smith says England’s Ben Stokes is “one of the best players” in the world but he cannot condone the behaviour that led to the all-rounder being arrested for an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub.

Stokes, 26, is England’s vice captain and one of their most important players, but his participation in next month’s Ashes series against Australia has been thrown into doubt after he was released under investigation following the incident.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former soccer star George Weah maintained his lead over Vice President Joseph Boakai as more provisional results from Liberia’s presidential election were announced on Friday.

If current trends hold, they would contest a run-off next month to decide which of them will succeed Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in what would be Liberia’s first democratic transfer of power in decades.

Based on returns from about a third of the country’s more than 5,000 polling stations, Weah has obtained 39.6 percent of votes cast, with Boakai of the ruling Unity Party (UP) at 31.1 percent, the elections commission said.

“We are still confident that there are places that we believe are our strong support ... We are very optimistic that with reports coming in, UP is going to take the lead,” Boakai told Reuters after Friday’s results announcement.

Charles Brumskine, a lawyer, was running third with 9.3 percent.

The final certified results from Tuesday’s poll must be announced by Oct. 25, although the provisional first-round winner is expected to be known in the coming days.

Weah, a striker for Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan who won FIFA’s World Player of the Year in 1995, came second to Johnson Sirleaf in a 2005 election that drew a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians.

He has served in the senate since 2014 for the opposition Congress for Democratic Change.

Boakai, the former head of Liberia’s petroleum refinery company and agriculture minister, has served as vice president since 2006.

Brumskine and the parties of two other candidates have said the vote was marred by fraud and vowed to contest the results. But they have not provided evidence of cheating and international observers said they saw no major problems.

Liberia, Africa’s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer occurred in 1944.

Le bitcoin, introduit il y a moins de neuf ans, reste très volatil et illiquide comparé aux grandes devises et à d‘autres actifs financiers et les motifs de cette nouvelle envolée sont loin d‘être clairs.

La demande croissante dont il fait l‘objet de la part d‘investisseurs qui veulent prendre le train de la hausse en marche pourrait bien être la principale explication de cette nouvelle poussée.

“Les gens veulent juste en être”, a dit Ryan Nettles, responsable du trading et de la stratégie de marché sur les devises de Swissquote, qui s‘est lancée dans le trading de bitcoin il y a deux mois. Il a ajouté que l‘intérêt des investisseurs s‘est révélé bien plus fort qu‘attendu et provient aussi bien de banques, de fonds spéculatifs que de courtiers.

“L‘intérêt découle vraiment du tapage médiatique.”

Le président russe Vladimir Poutine a mis en garde mercredi contre les “graves dangers” liés à ce marché naissant, tandis que la banque centrale russe a dit qu‘elle allait interdire les sites internet de trading de cryptomonnaies, ce qui n‘a pas empêché le bitcoin de gagner environ 10% depuis.

Une étude publiée la semaine dernière par SEMrush, un cabinet spécialisée dans l‘analyse des requêtes sur les moteurs de recherches, a fait ressortir une corrélation de 91% entre les requêtes sur le terme bitcoin sur Google et l‘évolution du prix de la cryptomonnaie, laissant entendre que les nouvelles, bonnes comme mauvaises, la concernant alimentent la demande même si les mauvaises nouvelles peuvent temporairement peser sur le cours.

Le bitcoin avait tutoyé les 5.000 dollars début septembre avant de chuter lourdement après des déclarations du patron de JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, qualifiant la cryptomonnaie de “fraude” qui allait exploser en vol. Les autorités chinoises ont par ailleurs fermé plusieurs plateformes d‘échange et de financement en bitcoin faisant craindre des restrictions plus larges.

Après être retombé sous le seuil des 3.000 dollars, le bitcoin a rebondi gagnant plus de 75% en quatre semaines.

Selon des informations de presse publiées au début du mois, Goldman Sachs étudierait la possibilité de lancer une activité de trading dédiée au bitcoin.

“Le bitcoin a été conçu pour fonctionner en dehors de l‘influence des gouvernements et des banques centrales et c‘est exactement ce qui se passe”, a dit Iqbal Gandham, directeur général de l‘application de trading sur téléphone mobile eToro, qui a enregistré une forte croissance des volumes d‘échange en cryptomonnaies.

Vers 15h00 GMT, le bitcoin était en hausse de près de 8% par rapport à la veille à 5.202,13 dollars sur la plateforme d‘échange luxembourgeoise Bitstamp.

En dépit de nombreuses mises en garde sur la formation d‘une bulle sur le bitcoin, y compris par le vice-président de la Banque centrale européenne Vitor Constancio, les tenants d‘une poursuite de la hausse ne manquent pas, d‘autant qu‘il est difficile d‘en déterminer la valeur.

“Pour la plupart des devises, il y a plusieurs méthodologies reconnues pour estimer la valeur relative, généralement fondées sur les fondamentaux économiques”, relève Daniel Murray, responsable de la recherche chez EFG Asset Management. “Pour le bitcoin, de tels fondamentaux n‘existent pas.”

D‘autres cryptomonnaies, dont les cours sont étroitement corrélés à celui du bitcoin, ont aussi monté. Leur valorisation totale a dépassé 160 milliards de dollars pour la première fois depuis le début du mois de septembre, selon le site internet spécialisé Coinmarketcap.com.","Le Bitcoin à plus de 5.000 dollars, quintuplement depuis fin 2016",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idFRKBN1CH2I8-OFRIN

The academy said in a statement that its 54-member board of governors “voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.”

A representative for Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, had no immediate comment.

The expulsion from the film industry’s most prestigious organization follows allegations reported by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they had been raped.

Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

For Weinstein, who made a name for himself and his studio with the critical and commercial success of a number of small-budget independent films, the expulsion was just the latest fallout - both professional and personal - from allegations that have rocked an industry that has often looked the other way when confronted by reports of sexual misconduct.

In announcing the decision to oust Weinstein, the academy said it was also telegraphing a broader goal.

“We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues, but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over,” the academy said.

“What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society,” it said. “The board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.”

The New York Police Department said this week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

His accusers included the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who told The New York Times that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein more than 20 years ago, and actress and director Angelina Jolie, who told the publication that she “had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth and as a result chose never to work with him again.”

BROTHER ADVOCATED EXPULSION

The academy’s board gathered on Saturday to discuss the allegations against Weinstein and his inclusion in the organization, which comprises 8,000 people from the film industry and invites members to join based on their contributions to film. Governors include such luminaries as director Steven Spielberg and actors Tom Hanks, Laura Dern and Whoopi Goldberg.

Weinstein is a member of the executives’ branch of the academy and is also a member of the Producers Guild of America. The PGA board is to meet on Monday to discuss whether to begin disciplinary proceedings against Weinstein, who would have 15 days to respond to any decision by the board, including an expulsion.

While Weinstein has driven numerous films to success at the Academy Awards over two decades, he has only won one Oscar himself, for producing best picture winner “Shakespeare in Love” in 1999.

The fallout from the allegations has been swift for Weinstein. He was fired at the beginning of this week from The Weinstein Co, the independent studio he co-founded in 2005 with his brother Bob Weinstein.

A spokesman for The Weinstein Co, in an email, cited Bob Weinstein’s interview published on Saturday with The Hollywood Reporter, in which he said the academy should expel his brother. Bob Weinstein said he was aware of his brother’s marital infidelities, but said he had no idea about “the type of predator that he was,” according to the industry publication.

Hachette Book Group, the U.S. publishing house of French group Lagardere, terminated the Weinstein Books imprint on Thursday. People magazine reported on Tuesday that Weinstein’s wife, Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman, was leaving him.

The worst on record for the same period in a year was 9.3 million acres in 2015.","SANTA ROSA (Reuters) - Authorities hope weaker winds will help more than 10,000 firefighters battle the deadliest blazes in California history, which have killed at least 40 people and destroyed thousands of structures in one of the state’s worst natural disasters in years.

Fast-moving fires spread by shifting winds forced thousands more to evacuate their homes on Saturday as the death toll over the week rose to 40, with hundreds missing.

More than 10,000 firefighters supported by air tankers and helicopters battled 16 major wildfires in areas north of San Francisco that have consumed nearly 214,000 acres (86,000 hectares), or roughly 334 square miles (865 sq km) - an area larger than New York City.

The 40 confirmed fatalities, including 22 in Sonoma County, make it California’s deadliest-ever fire event, surpassing the 29 deaths from the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles.

With 235 people still missing on Saturday in Sonoma County alone and rubble from thousands of incinerated dwellings yet to be searched, authorities expect the death toll to climb.

Some 100,000 people have been forced from their homes, including 3,000 on Saturday from the city of Santa Rosa, about 50 miles (80 km) north of San Francisco. The fires have damaged or destroyed about 5,700 structures, reducing homes and businesses to ash.

Some victims were asleep when flames engulfed their homes, while others had only minutes to flee.

“This is truly one of the greatest tragedies that California has ever faced. The devastation is just unbelievable. It is a horror that no one could have imagined,” California Governor Jerry Brown said on a visit to a devastated city.

Janis and Roberto Lucha joined people lining up at a Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Santa Rosa, seeking help after losing their home of 27 years in the city’s Coffey Park neighborhood, where most homes burned to the ground.

Molly Kurland, 63, joined a packed community meeting at the Santa Rosa High School gymnasium.

“Even for people who haven’t lost their house, the uncertainty and anxiety is tremendous,” she said.

But there were heroic stories as well.

Teen-aged twins woke their parents on Sunday night to find fire engulfing the landscape.

The persistent alarms from Benjamin Lasker, 16, gave the family time to escape the conflagration with little more than the clothes on their backs.

Benjamin and his twin sister, Natalie, went on to awaken another eight families in their Fountain Grove neighborhood in Santa Rosa, pounding on doors, yelling “Fire!” and shining lights in windows.

“They asked permission to wake people up,” Howard Lasker told Reuters, adding “I gave it to them.”

GLIMMERS OF HOPE

There were some glimmers of hope as winds weakened and firefighters made progress with blazes such as the Cascade Fire, about 80 miles northeast of Santa Rosa, which was nearly 10,000 acres and 87 percent contained on Saturday, Cal Fire said.

Weakening winds overnight should help but high temperatures and dry conditions were expected to remain through the weekend, forecasters said.

”This is still very much in play. The danger is still very present,” said U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California who accompanied Brown.

At least a dozen Napa Valley and Sonoma County wineries were damaged or destroyed, throwing the state’s wine industry and related tourism into disarray.

For the picturesque Napa Valley town of Calistoga, now evacuated, the winds were a double-edged sword. The town was spared by hazardous winds when they shifted, but Mayor Chris Canning warned a resurgence could pose a new threat.

Fire officials said the Tubbs fire, between Calistoga and Santa Rosa, was about 50 percent contained, while another in wine country, the Atlas fire, was at 45 percent. But the Nuns fire west of Napa was only 15 percent contained.

Others, including the Sulphur and the Redwood Valley fires, were at 70 percent and 30 percent containment, respectively, while the Oakmont was at only 10 percent.

Firefighters from Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Utah are helping battle the blazes.

Aircraft have dropped more than 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) of fire retardant.

Cal Fire estimated the fires would be contained by Oct. 20.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump has been quietly cutting support for halfway houses for federal prisoners, severing contracts with as many as 16 facilities in recent months, prompting concern that some inmates are being forced to stay behind bars longer than necessary.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Justin Long confirmed the cuts in response to an email inquiry from Reuters, and said they only affect areas with small populations or underutilized centers.

“The Bureau remains firmly committed to these practices, but has had to make some modifications to our programs due to our fiscal environment,” Long said.

Halfway houses have been a part of the justice system since the 1960s, with thousands of people moving through them each year. For-profit prison companies such as Geo Group Inc have moved into the halfway house market, though many houses are run directly by government agencies or non-profit organizations.

A Geo spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.

The bureau, which falls under the U.S. Department of Justice, last year had about 180 competitive contracts with “residential reentry centers” run by non-profit and for-profit companies, such as Geo.

The International Community Corrections Association says on its website there were about 249 separate halfway houses in communities nationwide that are covered by the 180 contracts.

Federal judges who spoke to Reuters said the cuts are having an impact in their districts, particularly in states with fewer facilities or larger geographic areas where the nearest center might be several hundred miles away.

Judge Edmund Sargus of the Southern District of Ohio said it was a real “stumper” when in July the government ended its contract with the Alvis facility serving the Dayton area.

Long said that the cuts have not reduced referral rates or placements, and only impact “about 1% of the total number of beds under contract.”

However, the changes coincide with other major criminal justice policy shifts by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has pushed for more aggressive prosecutions of drug offenses and a crackdown on illegal immigrants who commit crimes.

In May, Sessions ordered prosecutors to charge defendants with the highest provable offense, a move that is likely to trigger lengthy prison sentences.

In 2016, of the 43,000 inmates released from federal prison, 79 percent were released into a halfway house or home confinement, according to the trade association.

“We need to improve re-entry services ... This move flies in the face of that consensus,” said Kevin Ring, whose non-profit Families Against Mandatory Minimums has recently launched a Twitter campaign to raise awareness of the problem.

Sessions is scheduled to testify next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ring said he hopes lawmakers will ask Sessions about the changes underway for halfway houses.

“Is cutting re-entry opportunities really going to make us safer? Congress needs to ask the Justice Department if this is part of their strategy,” he said.

LONGER PRISON TIMES

For Kymjetta Carr, the cuts have had a personal impact. The 30-year-old from Cincinnati said she had expected her fiance Anthony Lamar to get out of prison and go to a halfway house in November, after serving seven years on a drug charge.

But she now has to tell their 10-year-old son his father won’t be out for Christmas or his birthday because Lamar’s release to a halfway house will not come until late July.

“It seems like the rug has been pulled out from under us,” she said, in an interview arranged through Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Halfway houses are low-security residences for thousands of convicted prisoners serving alternative sentences or on release from prison into partial freedom programs on the outside. The facilities are meant to help prisoners reenter their communities, find a job and get their lives back on track.

A study commissioned last year by the Justice Department found that centers have come under greater strain in recent years, as more people have been released from prison.

Blair Campmier, executive director of Reality House in Columbia, Missouri, said he was notified in early June that the center’s eight-year-old contract would be terminated.

Some of his clients were sent to halfway houses in Kansas City and Springfield, more than two hours away. “They were not happy, and their families were not happy,” said Campmier.

Ricardo Martinez, the Chief U.S. District Judge in the Western District of Washington and Chairman of the Committee on Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference of the United States, told Reuters he has sent a letter to the Bureau of Prisons’ new Director Mark Inch requesting discussions.

“From our perspective, these facilities are not only useful - they are essential,” Martinez said.",Exclusive: Trump administration reduces support for prisoner halfway houses,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-prisons-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-reduces-support-for-prisoner-halfway-houses-idUSKBN1CI2ZA

Gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines was up 1 percent at C$58.33. Gold futures rose 0.8 percent to above $1,303 an ounce after weak U.S. inflation data dampened the case for interest rate increases. [GOL/]

“There was a little reversal yesterday, things were sent lower by oil prices. We came in this morning and we had gold up through $1,300 and oil up on the day,” said Bruce Latimer, senior equity trader at Eight Capital, adding that the strong commodity prices bode well for the TSX.

“The market opened stronger and basically held that gain all day.”

The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index, which was up 0.5 percent on the week, finished 64.97 points, or 0.41 percent higher, to close at 15,807.17.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was interviewed on Friday by the special counsel investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 U.S. election.

“Mr. Priebus was voluntarily interviewed by Special Counsel Mueller’s team today,” said his lawyer, William Burck. “He was happy to answer all of their questions.”

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators are interviewing a number of White House and other officials as part of the inquiry into any ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.

Mueller’s inquiry includes whether Trump might have obstructed justice by trying to persuade then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser.

Flynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets said its third-quarter profit fell 19 percent, due mostly to a $1 billion mortgage litigation accrual.

But management also revised its outlook on a key expense-related metric, saying the bank expects to spend 61 cents for every dollar of revenue it generates this year, up from a range of 60 to 61 cents. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry suggested Wells Fargo may also face issues hitting next year’s cost-efficiency target.

Management now hopes to spend 59 cents for every dollar of revenue next year, the high end of a target range of 55 to 59 cents, he said.

But much depends on loan growth and interest rates, as well as elevated costs from regulations, technology and “lingering sales practice issues,” Shrewsberry cautioned.

Wells Fargo’s loan balances at the end of the third quarter were $951.9 billion, down $5.6 billion from the second quarter and down $9.4 billion from a year earlier

“We are waiting for the quarter that Wells shows stronger momentum across the business and this was not the quarter,” analysts from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a client note.

The mortgage litigation accrual is for a still-pending lawsuit brought by a U.S. Justice Department-led task force, Shrewsberry told Reuters.

The Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group has reached multi-billion dollar settlements with other banks over pre-financial crisis conduct, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

“They’re working down toward the end of that list and now we’re sort of in discussions with them,” Shrewsberry said in an interview. “The billion dollars is in connection with that activity.”

The bank’s shares were last down 3.3 percent to $53.40.

SCANDAL WOES

Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a sales practices scandal for more than a year. It has acknowledged opening perhaps 3.5 million accounts in customers’ names without their permission, signing others up for unwanted auto insurance, charging some for a mortgage rate-lock feature they did not request and tacking other costly add-ons to accounts.

The bank also has the same underlying challenges as rivals, including a drop in mortgage refinancing, interest income rising slowly after a prolonged period of rock-bottom rates, expensive technology investments and new regulations.

That has made it hard for outsiders to quantify how Wells Fargo’s scandal has influenced results.

On a conference call, analysts asked management whether weak loan growth was attributable to consumers backing away from the bank due to the scandal, or to the bank’s caution about credit risk.

The bank missed consensus revenue expectations for the fourth straight quarter due to the weak loan growth, and its lending profit fell.

Overall earnings fell to $4.6 billion. On an adjusted basis, profit was $1.04 per share, scraping past estimates of $1.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell 2 percent to $21.9 billion, hit by a 37 percent slump in mortgage banking and auto lending. Analysts had forecast revenue of $22.4 billion.

Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, which measures the difference between what banks spend on funds and what they generate from lending those funds, was 2.87 percent, down from 2.9 percent the prior quarter and below some analyst expectations.

The bank spent 65.5 cents per dollar of revenue during the quarter and 63.1 cents per dollar year-to-date.

Shrewsberry said the bank is committed to a previously stated plan to cut costs by $4 billion by the end of 2019, half of which will be reinvested into businesses.

Net income in Wells Fargo’s community banking segment, the largest of its three major businesses and the one most directly impacted by the sales scandal, was $2.2 billion, down 31 percent due to the legal charge.","Wells Fargo revises expense outlook, signaling profit difficulties ahead",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-results/wells-fargo-revises-expense-outlook-signaling-profit-difficulties-ahead-idUSKBN1CI1MC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

Ophelia, the sixth major hurricane of the Atlantic season, is due to make landfall on the south west coast of Ireland at around 0500 GMT on Monday, the Irish weather service said, describing the storm as “unprecedented.”

Hurricane force winds are likely off Ireland’s south coast but they are expected to ease before they reach the coastline, said the weather service, which has declared a Status Red weather alert.

The weather service has warned some gusts may exceed 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour).

The government has also warned of localized coastal flooding and likely disruption to transport and electricity services.

“You should not be out in this storm ... this is an extreme weather event,” the chairman of Ireland’s National Emergency Coordination Group Sean Hogan said at a briefing.

Asked if it was likely to be the worst storm in half a century, he said the “comparable weather event” was Hurricane Debbie, which killed 12 in Ireland in 1961. Ophelia has the potential to be a life-threatening event in Ireland, he said.

The storm is likely to pass close to a west of Ireland golf course owned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has been planning a wall to protect its greens from coastal erosion.

The storm has the potential to reshape stretches of the Irish coast, John Sweeney, a climatologist at Maynooth University,” said.

“It is going to be perhaps an event comparable to Debbie in 1961 which has effectively marked many of the coastlines of the west coast of Ireland to the present day,” Sweeney told state broadcaster RTE.

Members of the armed forces have been sent to Tralee on the south west coast to build coastal defenses with sandbags.

Britain’s meteorological service said in a statement that the weather system may effect road, rail, air and ferry services.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idUKKBN1CK058

En una declaración, la organización que otorga los premios Oscar dijo que en una votación de su Junta de Gobernadores de 54 integrantes se “sobrepasó ampliamente la mayoría requerida de dos tercios para expulsarlo inmediatamente de la Academia”.

La portavoz de Weinstein, Sallie Hofmeister, no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios sobre esta decisión.

La expulsión de Weinstein de la organización más prestigiosa de la industria del cine tiene lugar después de que The New York Times y The New Yorker reportaron acusaciones de varias mujeres que señalan haber sido acosadas o agredidas sexualmente por Weinstein desde la década de 1980.

Reuters no ha conseguido confirmar de manera independiente ninguna de las acusaciones. Weinstein, de 65 años y ganador de un premio Oscar, ha negado mantener sexo no consentido.

Al anunciar la decisión de expulsar a Weinstein, la Academia dijo que también estaba enviando un mensaje más amplio. “No estamos simplemente alejándonos de alguien que no merece el respeto de sus colegas, sino también enviando un mensaje de que la ignorancia deliberada y la complicidad vergonzosa respecto a un comportamiento sexual depredador y el acoso laboral en nuestra industria han terminado”, señaló.

“Lo que está en juego aquí es un problema muy preocupante que no tiene cabida en nuestra sociedad”, añadió la declaración. “La junta continúa trabajando para establecer estándares éticos de conducta que puedan sean ejemplificados por todos los miembros de la Academia”.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market’s rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P .SPX, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017’s rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

“If it’s just a mean-reversion trade, then it’s probably going to last another few weeks and then we’re back to the old winners,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If it’s something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that.”

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric (GE.N) and Honeywell International (HON.N), railroads CSX Corp (CSX.O) and Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) and steel company Nucor Corp (NUE.N) stand to yield insight into the economy’s health.

September’s stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September’s stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

“In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump’s election,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States .CESIUSD, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent.

“We’ve just had better data,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index .BADI.

“Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,” Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials (XLF.P), industrials (XLI.P) and energy (XLE.P), and outflows for technology (XLK.P) and healthcare (XLV.P), according to Lipper data.

“There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth ”hasn’t been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings.”

“For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year,” Warne said.",Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/cyclical-sector-rally-banks-on-global-economic-expansion-idUSKBN1CI1E6?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The new alliance would comprise Merkel’s conservative bloc - her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - along with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens.

Such a tie-up is called a “Jamaica” coalition, because the three parties’ colours of black, yellow and green match those of the Jamaican flag.

To secure a coalition agreement, the unlikely bedfellows must overcome differences on a range of issues including immigration policy, Europe, tax and the environment.

The CDU and CSU have reached an agreement over immigration policy, but it is not clear whether it will pass muster in a full coalition.

Following are remarks on the possible coalition from senior officials:

PROSPECTS FOR A JAMAICA COALITION:

ANGELA MERKEL (CDU)

“We achieved a joint result (with the Bavarian CSU allies) which I think is a very, very good basis to go into exploratory talks with the FDP and Greens.”

“On Friday, October 20th, we will have a first round of exploratory talks with all partners.”

“The parties come from very different starting positions. There will be discussions in a lot of policy areas with the FDP and the Greens.”

“We know that unusual combinations can, of course, bring the opportunity to find some solutions to things that had seemed unsolvable until now. So now we need to put our noses to the grindstone and see what we can do.”

THOMAS DE MAIZIERE (CDU)

“We’d be well advised not to be perfectionists in the upcoming coalition negotiations but rather to be open and to build trust that a government will be formed that acts sensibly, even during unforeseeable crises.”

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“Thoroughness is certainly more important than speed, but I‘m optimistic that everything will be sorted out by Christmas. All four parties are showing goodwill and the will of the voters is clear too: ‘Jamaica’ should be formed.”

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“We all need to just get started now.”

“Compromises always mean everyone needs to give a bit.”

“If the coalition comes off, it must not be a coalition that only agrees on the lowest common denominator. That won’t work.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“We don’t have to govern. There is also the possibility of another grand coalition (between Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats).”

WOLFGANG KUBICKI (FDP)

“It can succeed. The most important thing is that trust needs to be built between participants, and that takes time. That’s why it would be illusory to believe we could conclude negotiations by Christmas.”

IMMIGRATION:

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“No one would understand it if the new government does not pass an immigration law.”

“We need a mix of humanity and order. We Greens also want to secure the EU’s external borders and build a sensible database of fingerprints.”

“There must be a compromise that nonetheless represents everyone.”

SIMONE PETER (GREENS)

“This is an agreement between the CDU and CSU, and far from the result of exploratory talks for a coalition with the FDP and Greens.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“Immigration is not the only issue where the parties have different ideas.”

WOLFGANG KUBICKI (FDP)

“I am certain that, in the end, the solution that the CDU/CSU have found with each other will not be the basis for common work (with us) for the next four years.”

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“No party can expect the others to accept its original wording without changes ... But I believe that a signal about limiting immigration on humanitarian grounds will ultimately make its way into the coalition agreement.”

EURO ZONE FISCAL POLICY:

SIMONE PETER (GREENS)

“Europe’s fiscal policy needs a shift away from austerity toward a common pact for tax collection and investments, which would trigger social and ecological innovations.”

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“A red line for us in coalition talks is the mutualisation of debt in Europe, the creation of new pots of money.”

ENVIRONMENT:

GUENTHER OETTINGER (CDU)

“What we Christian Democrats call ‘preservation of Creation’ overlaps a lot with what the Greens call a sustainable approach to nature.”

CEM OZDEMIR (GREENS)

“A misunderstanding on the part of the chancellor must be cleared up before the exploratory talks begin: We Greens are resolutely against the driving bans of which there is a risk due to the lack of action and ignorance of her Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, Germany’s most incompetent minister.”

TAX:

CHRISTIAN LINDNER (FDP)

“There can only be a Jamaica tax concept if it includes the end of the solidarity surcharge without taking that money out of people’s pockets somewhere else.”",Factbox - German coalition watch: Agreeing on lowest common denominator not enough-Greens,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics-coalition-factbox/factbox-german-coalition-watch-agreeing-on-lowest-common-denominator-not-enough-greens-idUKKBN1CK0HD?il=0

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy.","Protestors against President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed liberalization of French labor laws were on the streets of the country’s cities on Tuesday. The marchers, chanting slogans and brandishing placards, halted traffic as they moved slowly through the streets. A fringe of anarchists broke windows; police responded by firing tear gas. But this was no rerun of the mass marches of past years, let alone the semi-revolutionary eruptions of 1968.

France’s second-largest union, the Conféderation Générale du Travail (CGT) was the only one of the three main workers’ organizations that took part. Another protest, this one organized by the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is scheduled for Sept. 23. This week’s marching columns numbered, nationwide, in the few hundred thousand rather than the many millions hoped for – the police claimed 223,000, the organizers 400,000. There was little effect on production, services or transport.

It was neither victory nor defeat for either side. Instead, Macron’s changes to the vast labor code – hiring and firing will be easier, some workplace issues will be negotiated at company level – hang in the balance. The CGT, the left and the far-right National Front all oppose them, but Macron and his government have a solid, if inexperienced, majority in the Assembly.

More than his predecessors who tried and failed to liberalize France’s labor market – the center-right Nicolas Sarkozy and the center-left Francois Hollande – Macron has pinned the credibility of his presidency on systemic, cultural change, a deliberate jolting of French society and economy out of the rut into which he believes it has fallen. He is contemptuous of both former presidents (he knew Hollande well, having been both his advisor and Finance Minister), believing them to have given up too soon and too easily. When Macron spoke, as he did earlier this month, of “slackers,” he said when challenged that he meant those who retreated from the necessary surgery on France’s body politic The marchers, however, seized on the word and put it on their placards: “Macron, the slackers will kick you out,” read one.

The slackers have a point. Indeed, they have several. Labor productivity in France is relatively good, only a little behind that of the United States and the highest of Europe’s major economies. When French workers work, they work well.

Though both Macron’s labor and economic reforms have won support from the center-right and from many economists, France remains doubtful, even hostile. Perhaps the best-known Frenchman in political and intellectual circles before Macron was the economist Thomas Piketty, whose “Capital in the 21st Century” (2013) is a best seller and who has excoriated his country both for its steeply rising inequality and its hypocrisy in pretending it is egalitarian. Hypocritical it may be, but it clings to the myth, and perfectly bourgeois Frenchmen and -women may recoil from an obvious widening of the income and wealth gaps.

To put major emphasis on labor reforms may, in any case, not be the main point. Germany liberalized its labor market through the so-called Hartz reforms between 2003 and 2005, but unlike France the German unions were relatively moderate, wage bargaining was already localized and investment was rising. In addition, the costs of German unification had already been paid.

If France’s CGT and the left/far-right cannot mobilize enough opposition, the labor reforms will be implemented, and they could be part of a general renaissance of the French economy. That is also dependent on other ifs – if the present improvement in the European Union economy continues (the European Commission, while underscoring that all members are growing, warns of “higher-than-usual uncertainty) and if investment increases, then France could become more like Germany. The German (and EU) leader Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to see that, and Macron wishes to show her he can deliver.

Yet delivery of this kind of economy now comes with an apparently unavoidable cost. Faster growth and even a fall in unemployment produces an ever-larger underclass, composed both of those with few qualifications and the still-increasing numbers of immigrants, often from poor countries. Macron’s opponents like to quote the Cambridge University economist Christopher Bickerton, who argued in a New York Times column that “not since the economic boom of the 1950s and ’60s has capitalism in Europe been dynamic enough to combine high levels of employment with long-term material gains for the masses.” It will not do so, he believes, under Macron.

The deeper movement, about which Macron can do little, is that the greater integration into the global economy that he champions produces huge gains for the top one percent, more modest rises for the well educated and skilled, but a much larger tail of the precarious, insecure and low paid. The leftist German think tank, the Rosa Luxemburg Institute, called this trend “the end of social capitalism.” A sign of this is the general decline of social democratic parties such as the once-mighty German Social Democrats and the shrunken French Socialists. Only in the UK has the main left party, Labour, made substantial political gains with a far-left leadership.

Social democracy depended on, and greatly furthered, “social capitalism.” It did so in France, under socialist governments, did so again in Germany and still does, though with difficulty, in the Scandinavian states. Organized labor had a place, even an honored and at times powerful one. Now, its gains are a hindrance, its ideology no longer attractive. The leaders of the further left – such as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Insoumise in France - gain by being fundamentalists, opposed to capitalism itself, social or not.

In moving France towards the globalist model, Macron echoes the claim made nearly four decades ago by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, that there is no alternative. In this, he may be more right than she: there is presently no popular base, no public assent, no powerful parties able to show that cooperation with capitalism is best for the workers. And that, sooner or later, will be a large problem – for leftists, or course, for the state which must provide some support for the poor and ultimately, for the capitalist system itself.",Commentary: Labor reform in France’s Macron economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-macron-commentary/commentary-labor-reform-in-frances-macron-economy-idUSKCN1BQ2DJ

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

AIN ISSA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they had launched their final assault on Syria’s Raqqa on Sunday after a convoy of Islamic State fighters left the city, leaving only a hardcore of jihadists to mount a last stand.

“The battle will continue until the whole city is clean,” said a statement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias.

SDF spokesman Talal Selo told Reuters that 275 Syrian Islamic State fighters had withdrawn from the city along with civilian family members, leaving “no more than 200-300” foreign militants to fight on.

Under the terms of their withdrawal, all other civilians left in Raqqa were to be allowed safe passage out of the city, Selo said, adding that he believed only a few remained.

Raqqa’s fall to the SDF now looks imminent after four months of battle.

“We still expect there to be difficult fighting,” said Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition backing the SDF in the war against Islamic State.

Raqqa was the first big Syrian city to fall to Islamic State as it declared a “caliphate” and rampaged through Syria and Iraq in 2014, becoming an operations center for attacks abroad and the stage for some of its darkest atrocities.

But Islamic State has been in retreat for two years, losing swathes of territory in both countries and forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley.

“Last night, the final batch of fighters (who had agreed to leave) left the city,” said Mostafa Bali, another SDF spokesman.

There were conflicting accounts as to how many people left in the convoy and who they were.

Selo said 275 Syrian fighters left along with their family members. Laila Mostafa, head of the Raqqa Civil Council, formed under SDF auspices to oversee the city, said that figure included both the fighters and their family members. She said an earlier comment by another council member that some foreign fighters had left in the convoy was wrong.

Before the convoy left, the coalition estimated that about 300-400 fighters remained.

HUMAN SHIELDS

The convoy would head to the remaining Islamic State territory in eastern Syria, Omar Alloush of the Raqqa Civil Council said on Saturday.

It was still in territory held by the SDF on Sunday morning, Selo said. Bali described the civilians who left with Islamic State fighters in the convoy as human shields.

The jihadists had refused to release them once they left the city as agreed, wanting to take them as far as their destination to guarantee their own safety, he said.

Such withdrawals of fighters along with groups of civilians have grown commonplace in Syria’s six-year war, as a way for besieging forces to accelerate the fall of populated areas.

The agreement was brokered by the Raqqa Civil Council and tribal elders to “minimise civilian casualties”, the coalition said on Saturday. Tribal leaders from Raqqa said they sought to prevent bloodshed among civilians still trapped in the city.

“If there are any civilians remaining (in the enclave) they would be the families of those foreigners. The civilians exited completely,” said Selo.

The SDF’s decision to hasten the battle’s end by allowing Islamic State fighters to leave Raqqa was at odds with the stated wishes of the U.S.-led coalition that backs the militias with air strikes and special forces.

Dillon said on Sunday it was not involved in the evacuation but added: “We may not always fully agree with our partners at times. But we have to respect their solutions.”

In August, the coalition spent weeks preventing a convoy of Islamic State fighters evacuated from an enclave on the Syrian-Lebanon border from reaching jihadist territory in eastern Syria.

JIHADIST CAPITAL

The SDF announced the start of the battle for Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign to isolate the city against the north bank of the Euphrates.

Islamic State, then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, had captured the city in January 2014, seizing it from rebel factions which had ousted the Syrian army a few months earlier.

As the group became more entrenched in Syria and Iraq leading up to its capture of Mosul in June that year, Raqqa became its most important center, and it celebrated its series of victories with a massive parade through the city.

Many of its top leaders were at times based there, and former hostages said Mohammed Emwazi, better known as Jihadi John, imprisoned them along with those he later executed, in a building near an oil installation near the city.

The group killed dozens of captured Syrian soldiers there in July 2014 and it was also the site of a slave market for Yazidi women captured in Iraq and given to fighters.

The coalition has said Raqqa was a hub for attacks abroad, and in November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa.

But the group is now in disarray. In Syria it does not only face the U.S.-backed SDF offensive but a rival one by the Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran and allied Shi‘ite militias.

A Syrian military source said on Saturday the army had captured the city of al-Mayadin in the Euphrates valley, leaving Islamic State only a few more towns and villages, and areas of the surrounding desert, in Syria.

But the battle for Raqqa has come at great cost to its people. Much of the city has been pulverized by the intense coalition air strikes and by the months of street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people have fled as refugees and hundreds of civilians have died.",Final assault starts on Syria's Raqqa as some Islamic State fighters quit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/final-assault-starts-on-syrias-raqqa-as-some-islamic-state-fighters-quit-idUSKBN1CK05A

Berlin (Reuters) - Die deutsche Wirtschaft warnt vor der mit Spannung erwarteten Iran-Rede von US-Präsident Donald Trump vor einer Isolierung der Islamischen Republik.

“Die Rückkehr von Sanktionen wäre eine große Gefahr für die Wiedereingliederung des Landes in die Weltgemeinschaft”, sagte der Präsident des Bundesverbandes der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), Dieter Kempf, am Freitag in Berlin. “Die deutsche Wirtschaft ist überzeugt, dass eine wirtschaftliche Isolation des Iran die Sicherheitslage in der Region gerade nicht stabilisiert.” Es wird erwartet, dass Trump das Atomabkommen am Freitagabend nicht erneut bestätigt.

Among many of us in the generations that have done well out of the post-World War Two period, there’s now a feeling of guilt - as there should be.

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

Post-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long. If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster.

Ophelia, the sixth major hurricane of the Atlantic season, is due to make landfall on the south west coast of Ireland at around 0500 GMT on Monday, the Irish weather service said, describing the storm as “unprecedented.”

Hurricane force winds are likely off Ireland’s south coast but they are expected to ease before they reach the coastline, said the weather service, which has declared a Status Red weather alert.

The weather service has warned some gusts may exceed 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour).

The government has also warned of localized coastal flooding and likely disruption to transport and electricity services.

“You should not be out in this storm ... this is an extreme weather event,” the chairman of Ireland’s National Emergency Coordination Group Sean Hogan said at a briefing.

Asked if it was likely to be the worst storm in half a century, he said the “comparable weather event” was Hurricane Debbie, which killed 12 in Ireland in 1961. Ophelia has the potential to be a life-threatening event in Ireland, he said.

The storm is likely to pass close to a west of Ireland golf course owned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has been planning a wall to protect its greens from coastal erosion.

The storm has the potential to reshape stretches of the Irish coast, John Sweeney, a climatologist at Maynooth University,” said.

“It is going to be perhaps an event comparable to Debbie in 1961 which has effectively marked many of the coastlines of the west coast of Ireland to the present day,” Sweeney told state broadcaster RTE.

Members of the armed forces have been sent to Tralee on the south west coast to build coastal defenses with sandbags.

“Ask the Sexpert” follows Dr Mahinder Watsa as he potters about his Mumbai apartment, peers at his computer and reads emails that tells him, among others, about someone with a compulsive habit of adding urine to his tea.

The film, which will be screened at the Mumbai Film Festival this year, was shot over four years by film-maker Vaishali Sinha and is a wonderful peek into the life of a columnist who has increasingly become part of pop culture in India’s financial capital, where his column is published in the Mumbai Mirror newspaper.

The column, a small strip in the inside pages that is featured every day, has three or four questions, mostly revolving around size, girth and how not to get pregnant. Watsa answers even the most outlandish questions with deadpan humour and in doing so, has found fans all over the city and beyond.

In the film, Sinha captures how young girls and their mothers gush over Watsa’s column, tell him how much they appreciate what he is doing and then line up to click selfies with him.

Sinha set out to make a film on Indians talking about sex because “it is the most universally shared experience.”

“While researching a character for a film idea on urban sexuality, I first met Dr. Watsa in early 2013. I pretty much knew immediately after my first meeting with him that I had found the character for my film,” Sinha told Reuters in an email interview.

The anti-thesis to Watsa in the film emerges in the form of Pratibha Naithani, a professor in a top Mumbai college who says she is on a mission to protect Indian culture. Naithani is mortified by Watsa’s matter-of-fact advice to people on all matters sexual, saying he openly encourages promiscuity.

Sinha said she didn’t start off trying to pit Naithani against Watsa, but added the college professor emerged as the “other camp” quite naturally.

“I didn’t choose Pratibha, her work chose me. A lot around the story lines I was exploring had ties to her or led to her and so her name would crop up to a point I couldn’t ignore. The petition for the banning of the 2009 nationwide sex education curriculum was one example. And it felt necessary that I reach out to her,” Sinha said.

The documentary features interviews with Watsa’s friends and family, but the camera mostly follows him as he goes about his day. He peers at his computer with a magnifying glass, attends seminars on sex education and counsels patients who come to him after having read his column.

Sinha said making the film made her aware that Indians are willing to talk about sex even if it was to reveal their lack of experience and knowledge, something that is evident from the kind of questions Watsa gets on a daily basis.

“I found out that for all the paranoia around ‘too much sex’, there are many, many people in between, living within a spectrum of sexual experiences and highs and lows. With that comes questions that are necessary to be talked about and discussed to alleviate stress and anxiety in society,” she said.

To many readers, Watsa is that person –who listens to their deepest, darkest problems without judging; and providing the answers that come without the baggage of all the taboos that still surround sexual behavior in India.",Blue movies: India's 'sexpert' gets a documentary,https://in.reuters.com/article/mumbai-film-festival-mahindra-watsa/blue-movies-indias-sexpert-gets-a-documentary-idINKBN1CI181

Presente em seis cidades brasileiras, o aplicativo FemiTaxi planeja expandir seus serviços para mais municípios no país e na América Latina até o início de 2018, enquanto o Lady Driver, que começou por São Paulo em março deste ano, iniciará operação no Rio de Janeiro em outubro.

O foco no público feminino tem apoiado ambos os aplicativos em um ambiente altamente competitivo, disputado por empresas que têm recebido milhões de dólares em investimentos como Uber, 99 e Cabify, as maiores do setor no país.

Um dos casos de violência contra mulher mais recentes e de grande repercussão nas redes sociais do Brasil ocorreu em agosto. A vítima, a escritora Clara Averbuck, fez um relato em seu Facebook de que foi estuprada por um motorista da Uber [UBER.UL] que a levava para casa depois de uma festa na capital paulista.

“Depois da divulgação da história da Clara (Averbuck), tivemos um aumento de 188 por cento nos downloads do aplicativo”, disse Charles Henry-Calfat, presidente-executivo e fundador do FemiTaxi, em entrevista à Reuters. Ele disse que percebeu o mesmo movimento depois da divulgação de outros casos de violência contra mulheres que usavam aplicativos de transporte urbano.

A Uber baniu do aplicativo o motorista que atacou a escritora e disse em nota à Reuters que “tanto motoristas parceiros quanto usuários estão sujeitos ao mesmo código de conduta e podem ser punidos, até com banimento, caso desrespeitem as regras”.

Procurada pela Reuters, Clara preferiu não se manifestar sobre o assunto.Segundo dados da Secretaria de Segurança Pública do Estado de São Paulo, os registros de casos de estupro de janeiro a agosto subiram 3 por cento sobre o mesmo período de 2016. A conta inclui 326 estupros consumados. As tentativas registradas de estupro dispararam 41 por cento, para 31 casos.

Já no Rio de Janeiro, segundo o Instituto de Segurança Pública do Estado, foram registrados 3.134 estupros de janeiro a agosto de 2017, alta de 2,2 por cento em relação ao mesmo período do ano anterior.

CULTURA MACHISTA

O FemiTaxi conta com 20 mil usuárias por mês e 1.130 motoristas mulheres em São Paulo, Goiânia, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Campinas e Santos. O fundador Calfat disse que planeja expansão para mais duas cidades brasileiras dentro de 2 ou 3 meses, sem revelar quais, e espera lançar seus serviços em outros países da América Latina no primeiro trimestre de 2018, inicialmente na Cidade do México e Buenos Aires. O Lady Driver, que afirma atender mais de 100 mil usuárias com cerca de 8 mil motoristas em São Paulo, se prepara para lançar seu serviço no Rio de Janeiro no final de outubro, afirmou à Reuters Gabriela Corrêa, presidente-executiva e fundadora da empresa. Ela acrescentou que pretende iniciar as operações na capital carioca com pelo menos 1 mil motoristas cadastradas. Gabriela, que morou no Equador, disse que a empresa estuda outras expansões no Brasil e na América Latina, mas ainda não definiu datas. “Peru é um país que todo mundo pede para levar o Lady. Peru, México, Equador são países que têm uma cultura machista, essa cultura latina é muito machista, então a demanda é muito grande.”

Uma pesquisa encomendada pelo Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, realizada pelo Datafolha e divulgada em março deste ano, mostrou que cerca de 66 por cento dos brasileiros presenciaram agressões contra mulheres em 2016. A percepção de 73 por cento da população é de que a violência contra mulheres aumentou, sensação compartilhada por 76 por cento das mulheres.

A insegurança não é receio apenas das passageiras, mas das próprias motoristas. Segundo levantamento realizado pelo FemiTaxi, 75 por cento das motoristas se sentem inseguras em transportar homens à noite e 68,6 por cento já recusaram corridas de homens por medo de serem assediadas. De acordo com o levantamento, realizado em agosto deste ano com 200 mulheres, 47,9 por cento das motoristas já sofreram algum tipo de assédio enquanto trabalhavam.

Única das grandes empresas do setor a ter uma versão de serviço voltada ao público feminino, a 99 afirmou que decidiu implantar a opção “99 Motorista Mulher” depois que uma pesquisa da empresa com 36 mil passageiros mostrou que mais de 70 por cento deles apontaram um serviço dedicado como solução preferida “para aumentar a segurança e comodidade”, disse a empresa à Reuters.

O serviço, lançado em outubro de 2016, permite que mulheres e crianças escolham ser atendidas por uma motorista. Após um ano, o opcional é o segundo mais procurado pelos usuários da 99, perdendo apenas para os pedidos de carro com ar-condicionado, afirmou a companhia, que tem mais de 300 mil motoristas e 14 milhões de usuários registrados no país.

A Uber, que não tem versão do serviço voltada especificamente para o público feminino, afirmou que investiu 200 milhões de reais em janeiro em uma central de atendimento 24 horas que responde às denúncias de má conduta na plataforma, de motoristas e usuários.

A empresa acrescentou que também lançou em março material de treinamento para seus motoristas, desenvolvido em parceria com uma revista feminina e a iniciativa da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) que busca desenvolver igualdade de gênero e direitos das mulheres, ONU Mulheres, sobre como tratar bem as usuárias do serviço.

A Cabify, que também não tem versão feminina da plataforma, informou que também conta com um serviço de atendimento 24 horas dentro do próprio aplicativo para usuários e motoristas e central telefônica para os condutores. A empresa disse à Reuters que além de um “rigoroso processo para o cadastramento de motoristas”, realiza palestras informativas presenciais sobre atendimento de qualidade e segurança.

INVESTIMENTOS

Segundo Calfat, do FemiTaxi, desde o lançamento do aplicativo, em dezembro passado, a empresa recebeu 500 mil reais de investimento e registrou crescimento de 25 por cento ao mês em corridas. O aplicativo deve voltar a buscar recursos em dezembro deste ano e espera levantar 3 milhões de reais, disse o executivo.

Já o Lady Driver, que recebeu 1 milhão de reais em uma rodada de injeção de recursos liderada pela holding de investimentos em startups Kick Ventures, planeja uma segunda captação para este mês.

A estudante de Direito Ana Luiza Procopio, 18 anos, que usa o Lady Driver há dois meses, afirmou que essa é uma forma de usar um serviço mais seguro, e “que o único problema é que, por terem poucas motoristas, geralmente os carros demoram mais para chegar do que em outros aplicativos (em torno de 8 a 10 minutos)”.

Já Luciana Fernandes, estudante de 18 anos, que também começou a usar o serviço para “sentir mais segurança”, acredita que os aplicativos femininos de transporte “empoderam as mulheres” e espera que a oferta de carros cadastrados por eles cresça no futuro.",ESPECIAL-Aplicativos de transporte para mulheres planejam expansão impulsionados por casos de violência,https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idBRKBN1CI1YK-OBRIN

BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate nearly 800 corruption charges filed against Jacob Zuma before he became president.

Zuma, who has faced and denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office, said he was disappointed by the court’s decision and asked the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to “consider representations” before deciding whether to proceed against him.

It was unclear when the NPA would make a decision on the charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s.

The ruling is likely to amplify calls for Zuma, 75, to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 and diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) chooses a new leader in December.

“It is going to make it a lot more difficult for his camp to get their presidential candidate elected,” said Gary van Staden, political analyst with NKC African Economics.

Friday’s unanimous Supreme Court ruling upheld a High Court decision in April 2016 that the charges against Zuma should be reinstated. They had been set aside in April 2009 by the then-head of the prosecuting authority, paving the way for Zuma to run for president later that year.

Rejecting an appeal brought by Zuma and the NPA, Judge Lorimer Leach said it was “irrational” for the NPA to have set the charges aside -- the same word used by the High Court.

“It is difficult to understand why the present regime at the NPA considered that the decision to terminate the prosecution could be defended,” the Supreme Court’s Leach said.

NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said prosecutors would need to consider the judgment but would “at all times do the right thing within the confines of the rule of law and in the interest of proper administration of justice”.

In a separate statement, the NPA said Zuma’s lawyers had asked the state prosecutor “not to serve an indictment on his client nor to re-enrol the matter prior to the representations having been considered”.

The prospect that Zuma’s removal may be inching closer lifted the rand against the dollar.

Zuma is unpopular with many investors after sacking respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March, a move that hit South African financial assets and helped tip the country’s credit ratings into “junk” territory.

Zuma has faced persistent corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the Gupta family may have used their influence to secure lucrative state contracts for their companies.

Reuters has not independently verified the emails, and Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Mmusi Maimane, leader of the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said he would write to the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams, to demand he indict Zuma.

“The charges have been formulated and the evidence is ready. We now await a trial date,” Maimane told reporters.

Asked by reporters whether Zuma should resign, the African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said the party would allow that process to take its course.

“The first thing is whether the NPA will decide to charge the president,” he said. “You’re putting the cart before the horse.”

SPY TAPES

National prosecutor Mokotedi Mpshe’s decision in 2009 to drop the 783 charges against Zuma in what has become known as the Spy Tapes case was based on phone intercepts presented by Zuma’s legal team. They suggested the timing of the charges in late 2007 may have been part of a political plot to stop Zuma, then deputy president, running for the top job.

Zuma was linked to the 1990s arms deal through his former financial adviser, who was jailed for corruption.

Analysts said the credibility of Zuma and the NPA were in question after the ruling. One lawyer, Ulrich Roux, who speaks to media as a legal analyst, said “a private prosecution could be instituted” if charges are not brought.",South African Supreme Court upholds reinstating 783 corruption charges against Zuma,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CI0UN-OZATP

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund members gave lukewarm endorsement to a strengthening global economy but conceded they were not out of the woods as they grappled with subdued inflation, low potential growth and an uneven recovery that clouded the outlook.

With central banks left with less firepower and some seeking to exit crisis-mode stimulus measures, the IMF members also renewed calls for fiscal policy and structural reforms to carry more of the burden in solidifying the recovery, now that the worst days of the economic storm had passed.

“Structural reforms that were difficult to do in hard times would be much easier in better times because the outlook is stronger,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Saturday.

“It’s when the sun is shining that you need to fix the roof. That message was received 100 percent (by the policymakers).”

A communique from the IMF’s steering body, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), said a global economic upswing, driven by a pickup in investment, trade and factory output, was brightening the outlook.

But it warned policymakers against complacency, saying that the recovery was “not yet complete” with inflation below target and potential growth weak in many countries.

Financial leaders attending the meeting also warned that while economies had improved in many countries there were people who had been left behind.

“We’re still an economy with our head in the oven and our feet in the freezer. So for the people with their feet in the freezer, that doesn’t resonate with them if you say everything’s on track,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.

PATIENCE NEEDED

The optimism on global growth was overshadowed by tensions on trade, which was in full show in contentious talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) held during the IMF’s autumn meetings.

The communique made no mention of trade, though Lagarde sought to offer a bright note by saying it was “perfectly legitimate” to renew long-standing trade agreements to respond to a changing world.

“Trade is a very powerful engine of growth, innovation, competition and productivity ... Hopefully if it is well done, it can be a win-win for all countries in those negotiations,” she said, when asked about the NAFTA talks.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The communique said member countries agreed to work together to reduce “excessive global imbalances,” and to look more carefully at potential side-effects that prolonged low interest rates could have on asset prices and economic activity.

Policymakers also had less to cheer on inflation and wages, which remain weak despite a strengthening recovery that prompted the IMF to upgrade its global growth forecast.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that while subdued price and wage growth has become a common phenomenon in advanced economies, it was ”only a question of time“ for them to accelerate as the economy gathers momentum.”

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said the key was patience.

“The bottom line in terms of policy is that we are confident that as the conditions will continue to improve, the inflation rate will gradually converge in a self-sustained manner,” he said.

“But together with our confidence, we should also be patient because it’s going to take time.”",Global policymakers grapple with half-baked recovery short of wage growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-g20/global-policymakers-grapple-with-half-baked-recovery-short-of-wage-growth-idUSKBN1CJ0QX

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Warning signs are flashing after another big quarter at Samsung Electronics. The South Korean group’s top executive, Kwon Oh-hyun, unexpectedly resigned on Friday following record-smashing forecasts for operating profit. An early lead in memory chips has fuelled blistering earnings growth at Samsung despite legal woes. But as rivals circle, a widening leadership vacuum looks worrying.

Kwon says the firm is “confronted with unprecedented crisis inside out” – an incredible admission for a departing leader. And the timing of his surprise retirement is troubling. Since the arrest and conviction of family scion and heir apparent Jay Y. Lee this year, the 64-year old Kwon has emerged as a key leader at the $325 billion tech behemoth. He serves as co-chief executive and vice chairman. Besides coordinating company-wide decisions and leading corporate-governance reform efforts as chairman of the board, the company veteran also oversees Samsung’s all-important semiconductor arm.

Thanks to that division, Samsung expects operating profit for the three months to September to top $13 billion, nearly triple the figure from a year earlier. Increasingly powerful smartphones and the rise of artificial intelligence mean electronic devices require ever-larger amounts of data storage.

That has led to a global shortage of two kinds of memory chips, in particular, known as NAND and DRAM. Samsung’s early bets in this space are paying off: full-year earnings are expected to rise 82 percent to 40.9 trillion won ($32.7 billion), according to analysts polled on Eikon.

Yet even Kwon admits the record earnings are the “fruit of past decisions” and that the company is “not even close to finding new growth engines”. To make matters worse, rivals are aggressively investing to boost supply. Global semiconductor capital spending is forecast to jump 20 percent this year, according to industry tracker IC Insights. In 3-D NAND, one of the memory industry’s hottest sectors, analysts at Bernstein reckon that supply will outstrip demand next year, weighing on prices. A vacuum at the top now bodes ill for Samsung.",Breakingviews - Warning signs flash at Samsung after big quarter,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-electronics-kwon-breakingview/breakingviews-warning-signs-flash-at-samsung-after-big-quarter-idUSKBN1CI0GI

BASF, the world’s third-largest maker of crop chemicals, has so far avoided seed assets and instead pursued research into plant characteristics such as drought tolerance, which it sells or licenses out to seed developers.

But Bayer’s $66 billion deal to buy U.S. seeds group Monsanto, announced in September 2016, has created opportunities for rivals to snatch up assets that need to be sold to satisfy competition authorities.

Bayer said it would use the proceeds to partly refinance the Monsanto acquisition. It plans to raise $19 billion toward the deal by issuing convertible bonds and new shares, and has lined up as much as $57 billion of bridge financing from banks.

Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said a higher-than-expected valuation of the assets up for sale could mean Bayer now needs to raise less than $10 billion from the sale of new shares, which would be a positive surprise.

Bayer had offered to sell assets worth around $2.5 billion. The European Commission said in August that the divestments offered by Bayer so far did not go far enough and started an in-depth investigation of the deal.

Bayer has to sell the LibertyLink-branded seeds and Liberty herbicide businesses, which generated 2016 sales of 1.3 billion euros, because they compete with Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer and Roundup Ready seeds.

Related Coverage BASF CEO says to look at more seed M&A after Bayer deal

LibertyLink seeds, used by soy, cotton and canola growers, are one alternative to Roundup Ready seeds for farmers suffering from weeds that have developed resistance to the Roundup herbicide, also known as glyphosate.

The spread of Roundup-resistant weeds in North America has been a major driver behind Liberty sales.

“BASF’s decision to acquire seeds assets represents something of a change to its prior view on its needs to respond to recent industry consolidation in agriculture,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.

“Nonetheless, the proposed assets for acquisition are high margin and high growth and represent a sensible bolt-on addition,” they added.

BASF Chief Executive Kurt Bock told a conference call he would look at further acquisition opportunities in the seeds sector as well but said it would take “two to tango”.

The group is also expected to look at other assets – such as vegetable seeds – that Bayer may be forced to divest, a person close to the matter said.

Shares in Bayer rose 1.2 percent to the top of Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI by 1230 GMT, while BASF was up 0.2 percent.

POSITIVE SURPRISE

The sale to BASF values Bayer’s assets at around 15 times 2016 operating profit (EBITDA) of 385 million euros, which analysts said was reasonable compared with multiples of 19.3 for ChemChina’s [CNNCC.UL] takeover of Syngenta (SYNN.S) and more than 20 for Dow’s DOW.N tie-up with DuPont DD.N.

BASF will finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and bonds.

It is expected to reap sales synergies in the hundreds of millions of euros. On the cost side, however, savings will be slim at first as there is little overlap with BASF’s existing business and the group has promised to keep all permanent staff at the businesses it is buying for at least three years.

The acquisition will add to its earnings by 2020, it said.

The deal is conditional upon Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto going through. While the European Commission could block that transaction, it has approved others, such as the Dow-DuPont deal and ChemChina’s takeover of Syngenta - although only after securing big concessions.

Bayer said it continued to work with the authorities to close the Monsanto purchase by early 2018.

As part of the asset sale to BASF, more than 1,800 staff, primarily in the United States, Germany, Brazil, Canada and Belgium, will transfer to BASF. It is also acquiring manufacturing sites for glufosinate-ammonium production and formulation, seed breeding facilities and research facilities.

The official cause of the disaster was under investigation, but officials said power lines toppled by gale-force winds on Sunday night may have sparked the conflagration. A resurgence of extreme wind conditions that had been forecast for Wednesday night and early Thursday failed to materialise, giving fire crews a chance to start carving containment lines around the perimeter of some of the blazes.

The animals are fitted with infrared bio-sensors which monitor their heartbeat and movement. Data is analyzed by a computer, and any changes in the animals’ body or behavior flags a change in the purity levels of the water in its tank.

“When three or more crayfish are moving or change their pulse activity, we know that the water parameters have changed. We can react quickly because we have the result within three minutes,” head brewer Michal Voldrich told Reuters.

The water system was developed and patented by scientists at the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Water at South Bohemia University at Vodnany.

“We are using crayfish like a living chemical laboratory – like a bio indicator and bio sensor together,” said Pavel Kozak, Director of the university’s Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology.

“The crayfish react very fast on any non-specific change, which is different than any other detectors, which react fast on a very low concentration (of pollution) but only on one specific agent.”

Researchers aim to upgrade the technology used in the scheme, and plan to use special cameras to monitor the animals’ hearts.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).
This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.
The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.
“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.","ZURICH (Reuters) - While London’s sewers can get clogged with fatbergs made up of grease and diapers, it seems Switzerland’s waste system is flecked with silver and gold.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

Arsenal took a 1-0 first-half lead thanks to Per Mertesacker’s 39th-minute header, but Watford turned the tables in the second period and claimed victory through substitute Deeney’s 71st-minute penalty and Tom Cleverley’s 92nd-minute winner.

Wenger blamed the defeat on what he called a “scandalous” decision to award a penalty for Hector Bellerin’s collision with Watford’s Brazilian forward Richarlison, but Deeney said he should focus on the performance of his own players instead.

”I’ve heard Wenger’s already saying the penalty is the reason they lost,” Deeney told BT Sport. “Well, I‘m not going to be one to tell Mr Wenger about himself, but there’s a reason they lost and it wasn’t because of one penalty.

”Whenever I play against Arsenal, I’ll go up and think, ‘Let me whack the first one and see who wants it’.

Em setembro, o ministro Edson Fachin, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), homologou o acordo de delação premiada do empresário Lúcio Funaro.

A partir da próxima terça-feira, a Comissão de Constituição e Justiça (CCJ) da Câmara inicia o processo de discussão para a votação de parecer sobre a segunda denúncia contra o presidente Temer -- como haverá muitas inscrições para falas de deputados, o votação pode não ocorrer no mesmo dia.

Em nota, a defesa de Temer afirmou que “o vazamento de vídeos com depoimento prestado há quase dois meses pelo delator Lúcio Funaro constitui mais um abjeto golpe ao Estado Democrático de Direito” e que teria o objetivo de causar “estardalhaço” para constranger os parlamentares que votarão o parecer sobre a denúncia na CCJ.

“As afirmações do desqualificado delator não passam de acusações vazias, sem fundamento em nenhum elemento de prova ou indiciário, e baseadas no que ele diz ter ouvido do ex-deputado Eduardo Cunha, que já o desmentiu e o fez de forma inequívoca, assegurando nunca ter feito tais afirmações”, diz a nota, assinada por Eduardo Pizarro Carnelós, advogado de Temer.

Na última terça-feira, o relator do caso na comissão, deputado Bonifácio de Andrada (PSDB-MG), apresentou parecer pela rejeição da acusação contra o presidente.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an Iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of Kirkuk, which controls the access to some of the region’s main oilfields, a Kurdish security official said on Sunday.

Meanwhile, an Iranian military official arrived in Iraq’s Kurdistan region for talks on the growing crisis between the Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government following last month’s Kurdish independence referendum.

Major General Qassem Soleimani is the commander of foreign operations for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards who provide training and guns to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi‘ite-led government in Baghdad, known as Popular Mobilization.

The top Kurdish leadership met on Sunday to discuss the crisis and rejected the Iraqi government’s demand that it cancels the outcome of the independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute.

The vote delivered an overwhelming ‘Yes’ for independence.

The meeting was attended by Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani, Iraqi President Fuad Masum, a Kurd who hold a largely ceremonial position in the Iraqi federal state, and Hero Talabani, the widow of Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani who died this month, a Barzani aide said.

They rejected what they described as “military threats” and pledged to defend Kurdish-held territory in case of an attack.

Popular Mobilization had given the Peshmerga until midnight local time (2100 GMT Saturday) to leave a position north of the Maktab Khalid junction, a security official from the Kurdistan Regional Government said.

Ali al-Hussaini, a spokesman for the paramilitary groups known as Hashid Shaabi in Arabic, told Reuters the deadline had expired without giving indications about their next move. “We are waiting for new orders. No extension is expected,” he said.

The Kurdish position north of the junction controls the access to an important airbase and Bai Hassan, one of the region’s main crude oil fields, the KRG official said.

The city, the airbase and their immediate surroundings, including the oilfields, are under Kurdish control.

There were no clashes reported 17 hours after the deadline but tension remained high with both sides mobilized.

KURDS SEE IRAQI “THREATS”

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Shi‘ite-led central government in Baghdad are at loggerheads since the Sept. 25 vote and its loud call for Kurdish independence.

Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront Iraqi “threats.” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the Kurds.

Popular Mobilization is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to Abadi. It is deployed alongside the army south and west of Kirkuk.

Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk’s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.

The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its vote for independence, including banning international flights in and out.

Baghdad’s tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbors Turkey and Iran - both with their own sizeable Kurdish minorities, and in Turkey’s case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency.

In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the situation had the full attention of the United States, which was working to ensure it does not escalate.

TASS cited a Russian parliamentarian at the time as saying Moscow would call on the two countries to use the opportunity to have direct talks to try to narrow their differences.

But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Korea’s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) said on Friday it would open a new distribution center in Bolton, northwest England, in 2018, stepping up its expansion drive in its third-largest market outside North America.

Amazon has 16 distribution centers in Britain and the new center will be supported by advanced robotics technology to help lift and move products around the plant. It will also employ 1,200 new, full-time permanent people, the company said.

The new jobs mean the online retailer will have created 3,500 jobs in the region, including Bolton and two other centers, one in Manchester set up in 2016 and another in Warrington, which opened this year.

It said that, including operating costs, it had invested 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in Britain since 2010 in logistics, order filling, research and development and head office functions.

Following criticism from politicians about weak worker protection, the company has been increasingly employing its warehouse staff directly, rather than indirectly via contract firms which offer little employment security.

On Friday it set out the levels of pay, stock options, pensions and training that would be available for any new employee. Salaries start at 7.65 pounds per hour, but also include a variety of management, engineering and support roles.

Northwest England received a blow on Tuesday when major employer BAE Systems announced the cut of 750 highly skilled jobs at two aircraft manufacturing plants in Lancashire.

The Bolton center will ship easily sortable items to customers that lend themselves to current robotics technology, including books, toys and kitchenware.

The online retailer has expanded rapidly in Britain in recent years, and is looking for the new distribution plants to expand its product selection and enable more small and medium enterprises to sell their own wares through Amazon Marketplace. Half of all units stocked in British centers are from outside firms.

Separately this week, Booths, a high-end supermarket chain located in the north of England, said it would begin offering a range of its products online through AmazonFresh for home delivery to consumers in London and southeastern England.",Amazon steps up UK expansion drive with new distribution center,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-amazon-jobs/amazon-steps-up-uk-expansion-drive-with-new-distribution-center-idUSKBN1CI0YZ

“We will be paying close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead,” Yellen said in prepared remarks at an international banking seminar in Washington. “My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist.”

Yellen also said she expected the U.S. economy to exceed its long-term trend during the second half of the year and repeated the impact of recent hurricanes on the economy should be temporary.

The U.S. central bank voted to hold interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in September. Since then, Yellen has repeatedly acknowledged rising uncertainty on the path of inflation, which has been retreating from the Fed’s 2 percent target rate for much of the year.

Minutes from the meeting, released last Wednesday, showed policymakers had a broad debate about recent soft inflation and the impact on interest rates if it fails to rebound.

However, Yellen and some other key policymakers have also made plain they expect to continue to gradually raise interest rates given the strength of the overall economy and continued tightening of the labor market.

Fed officials largely shrugged off a weak jobs report for September and pinned the decline in employment on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily displacing workers.

In her speech, Yellen said the most recent wage gains contained in the September jobs report were encouraging and that she expected the central bank to raise interest rates further.

“We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the recovery will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.”

The central bank has raised interest rates four times in its tightening cycle which began in late 2015. The Fed currently predicts one more rate rise this year and three the next.

The Fed has two more scheduled meetings this year, in November and December.

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Sunday called for calm less than 24 hours ahead of a deadline from Spain’s central government for him to clarify whether he has declared independence for Catalonia or not.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Tuesday night, only to suspend it seconds later and call for negotiations with Madrid on the region’s future.

Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has given him until Monday to clarify his position - and then until Thursday to change his mind if he insists on a split - threatening to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy if he chooses independence.

“The (Catalan) Government and I want to reiterate our commitment to peace, civility and serenity, and also to (...) democracy as inspiring the decisions we have to make,” Puigdemont said during at a memorial event at Barcelona’s Montjuic cemetery.

“In these difficult hours of hope in Catalonia, let’s take a clear attitude against violence (...) in favour of civility, hope, serenity and respect.”

Though Puigdemont did not indicate how he would reply to Madrid, public Catalan TV broadcaster TV-3 said he would not give a “yes” or “no” answer, but a more elaborate response.

The Spanish government has said it will take control of Catalonia if Puigdemont give an ambiguous reply.

“The answer must be without any ambiguity. He must say ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told Cope radio on Saturday.

Puigdemont, who is consulting local parties to prepare his answer, faces a dilemma.

If he says he did proclaim independence, the central government will step in. If he says he did not, the far-left Catalan party CUP would probably withdraw its support for his minority government.

The Catalan government says 90 percent of Catalans voted for a breakaway in an Oct. 1 referendum that central authorities in Madrid declared illegal and most opponents of independence boycotted, reducing turnout to around 43 percent.

Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the central government can suspend the political autonomy of a region if it breaks the law.

This article, which enables Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call a regional election, has not been activated since the constitution was adopted in 1978 after the death of dictator Francisco Franco.

Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported on Sunday that if article 155 was invoked, the government would replace the Catalan government with a new set-up to manage the region autonomously, which could be run by politicians or technocrats. Within three months, elections would be held.",Catalan leader calls for calm ahead of Madrid deadline,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CK0J3-OCATP
