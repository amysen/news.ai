But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a “wartime general, not a peacetime general” for institutions facing conflict. That’s not to say the troops are always in agreement.

In interviews with about a dozen league and team executives — all of whom refused to speak on the record — several owners seemed pleased with his approach to addressing the anthem controversy, which was to strive for a way for the N.F.L. to appear patriotic while respectful of its players who were kneeling to raise awareness of racism and police brutality toward African-Americans.

But there has been friction. Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players for kneeling during the anthem. Lockhart told reporters that players talking about police brutality is “what real locker room talk is.”

The statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as “locker room banter” comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.

In a meeting at N.F.L. headquarters the next day, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder confronted Lockhart to tell him his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.

Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.

In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart has helped amplify the league’s message, even if they question whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises. The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that “you can’t dump this at his feet,” one team executive said of Lockhart.

Lockhart said that he understands why the owners are frustrated, but he said his job is to keep pushing the league’s view, and pushing back at those who oppose it.

“That’s why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and it’s a great business,” he said.

The owners’ criticism, he said, “is just part of the job.”

Given the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation whether Lockhart is long for the job. But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.

At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within an arm’s reach of the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts. Goodell is tall, athletic and prim. Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled. He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.

Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart’s links to football are thinner. Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he said he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office. In high school, he played basketball, not football.

On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York. (His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)

His political genes developed early.

Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports. His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News. Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.

His skills in choppy political waters have been put to the test in the month since Trump lashed out at players who did not stand for the national anthem.

From the start of the crisis in late September, Lockhart used tactics he honed in Washington. He has pushed the league’s case repeatedly by reaching out to reporters with statements and near-daily conference calls. Through his bidding, the league has publicized positive things that the players are doing in their communities, promoted the idea that the players and owners are united (despite evidence on the field to the contrary), and tried to avoid addressing the president’s remarks directly.

Some of the tone and messaging of the league’s statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed. They seemed to seek a “third way,” a famously Clintonian way of compromise.

The league’s initial, 87-word statement, issued the day after the president first attacked the league, came after Goodell, Lockhart and other league executives called owners to sound them out. Most N.F.L. statements are bland, but this one was notable for its directness as well as for what it left out.

Goodell’s statement did not explicitly defend the players’ right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.

“Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities,” it said.

Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own. But other owners issued statements lamenting the league getting pulled into political debates.

After weeks of back and forth, and owners flirting with requiring players to stand, fewer players are kneeling during the anthem.

Lockhart has kept his assertive posture. In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L. should force all players to stand for the anthem. “He’s exercising his freedom to speak, and I’m exercising my freedom not to react,” Lockhart replied dryly.

As the N.F.L. and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretches its capacity to control the narrative.

Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiancée in an elevator.

When his predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L. at the end of 2015, Lockhart was a logical choice to replace him. Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L. more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy. (It is unclear what he is paid, but, according to N.F.L. tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)

Lockhart, who worked on political campaigns dating to Jimmy Carter’s re-election bid in 1980, has quickly changed the metabolism in the league’s communications office. When The New York Times published an article last year that compared the N.F.L.’s approach to the concussion crisis to that of the tobacco industry, Lockhart issued a long and detailed rebuttal, and said the league would consider taking legal action. (None has been taken.)

Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed. Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockhart’s assertion that the league has tried to become more transparent. Lockhart’s conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, he said.

“There’s no question they have been more proactive, and that’s part of Joe Lockhart’s approach to it,” Trotter said. “They will respond to things quicker than in the past. Does that mean it’s accurate? No, but it’s their opinion.”

Still, to a certain extent, he is still seen as a political animal, and a few owners, who by and large lean right, have questioned whether a lifelong Democrat like Lockhart (who sold his house in Washington to former President Barack Obama) was the best person to speak on behalf of the league.

Lockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.

“My work is about making sure that people understand what it is we’re doing, why that is and what impact it is having,” he said. “That’s devoid of a political agenda. It doesn’t mean I don’t have political views. But my overriding view when I come to work is, What’s good for the N.F.L.?”",The Battle-Scarred West Wing Veteran Scripting the N.F.L.’s Anthem Message,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/sports/football/nfl-anthem-lockhart.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But here are some tips from design and color experts on how to use dark colors without becoming overwhelmed — or claustrophobic.

START SMALL If you’re nervous about playing with a deep, dark hue, “limit the color to the inside of cabinets, backs of bookshelves or a painted floor,” said Donald Kaufman, who owns the paint company Donald Kaufman Color with his wife, Taffy Dahl. “Dark, bold windows often bring the outside in.”

Ms. Studholme, of Farrow & Ball, suggested starting with a contained space like a powder room, the underside of a claw-foot tub or a hallway. “When you arrive, it creates a sense of drama,” she said. “You come through and go, ‘Wow.’” An added bonus, she noted: “A dark color in the hall makes the rooms off the hall feel really big and light.”

Ellen O’Neill, director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore, recommends starting with a focal point, like a fireplace mantel or the inside of shelves or drawers. “I recently photographed a home where the owner painted the inside of the drawers of an antique Chippendale chest a rich aubergine,” she said. “What a color surprise every time you open a drawer.” And as you become more confident, she said, “you can graduate to painting doors to a room or hallway, window trim or wainscoting.”

TEST IT OUT When you’re ready to tackle a whole room, “start with a color family that is already dominant in the home and select two to three shades that you feel makes a statement,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I’d get quarts of each color and paint large swatches of each, one set next to a window and one set in a corner. Observe how the room’s lighting affects the colors three times a day.”

EMBRACE THE DARKNESS “A deep, rich color goes an especially long way in a room without a lot of natural light, as dim rooms look particularly dull in lighter colors,” said Frances Merrill, the founder of Reath Design in Los Angeles, who painted her children’s room Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon gray. “It makes the small space feel finished and gives definition to the ever-rotating collection of artwork.”

In the playroom, she used Templeton Gray from Benjamin Moore. “Every surface in this room is usually covered in a layer of Legos and half-finished science experiments,” she said. “I find that the deeper colors mask the chaos.”

“Conventional wisdom states that small spaces — especially those facing north — should be lightened to increase the sense of space,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute consultancy. “However, painting trim a lighter color in an area painted with darker hues can actually increase the illusion of space,” she said, because it creates a “greater impression of height or width in the space.”

Whatever your situation, “it’s best to work with what you’ve got, rather than try to fight the light,” said Ms. Studholme of Farrow & Ball, which offers a guide to how light affects color on its website.

PREPARATION IS KEY “Before painting, ensure surfaces are sound, clean, dry and free from dirt, grease and any other contamination,” said Ms. Cosby of Farrow & Ball. “Always sand down surfaces to achieve a smooth base.”

And if you change your mind later, dark colors are just as easy to paint over as light ones, assuming you prep properly. “Start by priming over the bold hue, then apply two coats of the desired color,” said Ms. O’Neill of Benjamin Moore. But “be sure to allow the primer coat to dry completely before applying the first coat of color.”

GO HALFSIES To add “sophistication and spirit” to a client’s “stark, boxy, white rental,” Alex Kalita, a founder of Common Bond Design in Manhattan, painted the bottom half of the bedroom wall in Hague Blue from Farrow & Ball. She calls it “the chair-rail effect” and notes that it serves a few purposes: “It simulates architectural variation in otherwise uniform space; it ties in the building’s teal window frames; and it leverages the cozy, rich, complex and grown-up quality of Hague Blue, while maintaining the practical qualities of white paint, like the illusion of ceiling height.”

Another tip: “If you’re tempted to go dark and bold on the walls, but you prefer a restrained aesthetic, try keeping the furniture neutral,” Ms. Kalita said. “You can even make bulkier pieces recede by camouflaging them in the wall color. We had our client’s Wonk NYC dresser color-matched to Hague Blue, so that the piece could augment the client’s storage without competing for attention with the room’s more deliberate and sculptural design elements. Dark walls do a good job of visually absorbing things.”

FINALLY, BE BRAVE “I encourage people to be brave with color and unleash their inner artist,” said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Experiment with color, have fun with it, allow yourself to live with it for a while. It is, after all, just one or two cans of paint. And when, and if, you tire of it, move on to another color and treat yourself to another creative exercise.”",Scared of Dark Paint?

One reason is that as humans we’ve evolved to survive in groups, not alone. Rallying together makes us feel less alone in the experience, explained the sociologist Christine Carter, a fellow at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley.

“When our survival is threatened, we are going to reach out and strengthen our connections with people around us. We show generosity. We show compassion. We show gratitude. These are all emotions that function to connect us with each other,” Dr. Carter said.

Scientific evidence supports the idea that acts of generosity can be beneficial when we volunteer and give back regularly — and not just after a natural disaster. Volunteering is linked to health benefits like lower blood pressure and decreased mortality rates.

Dr. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has been studying the effects of positive emotions, such as compassion and kindness, on the brain since the 1990s. He said the brain behaves differently during an act of generosity than it does during a hedonistic activity.

“When we do things for ourselves, those experiences of positive emotions are more fleeting. They are dependent on external circumstances,” he said. “When we engage in acts of generosity, those experiences of positive emotion may be more enduring and outlast the specific episode in which we are engaged.”

Helping others also gives us a sense of purpose. Dr. Linda Fried co-founded Experience Corps, a program that engages retirees as literacy tutors, after she discovered a strong association between a sense of purpose and well-being throughout life. Older adults who volunteered to help children with reading and writing tended to experience less memory loss and maintain greater physical mobility, one study suggested.

Giving back is a fundamental teaching of many religions. Jesus had the Golden Rule. Buddha said in order to brighten one’s own path, one must light the path of others.

During a trip to India in 2016, I experienced firsthand how the benefits of doing good are well established in Indian society. I paid a visit to a Vedic astrologer because I was anxious about an uncertain future, my own personal crisis, and received a list of prescriptions to help others to get through it. The first task was to buy a black-and-white checkered blanket, then visit a local leper colony and donate it to the first person I saw. My next task was to buy a six-pound bag of lentils, circle it around my head, chant a Sanskrit mantra and give it to a homeless person.

Certainly, many Westerners would roll their eyes at these unconventional “prescriptions,” but they were familiar to my Indian friends, who believe they hold real power.

Later, to better understand the significance of the rituals, I reached out to Dr. Deepak Chopra, author of “You Are the Universe.” He said the philosophical underpinnings in India come from the Vedas and Buddhist traditions, where “all human suffering is a result of the hallucination of the separate self.”

Dr. Chopra explained: “The moment you identify yourself as separate from other beings, or other people, or separate from life in general then you will suffer. And it all begins with initial anxiety because when you’re disconnected from people and life, you feel fear, and that creates the beginning of suffering.”

Would Western doctors ever prescribe acts of generosity? Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, doesn’t rule it out.

“We have sufficient scientific information to justify a very significant public health initiative,” he said. “If there were a retiree in my office I would ask them, ‘Do you smoke? Do you exercise?

Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human “trolls” and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.

Now the Silicon Valley companies — long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington — face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance. Twitter’s general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.

Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform. Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads’ sponsors.

But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter’s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.

Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities’ use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company’s decision on Thursday — but cautioned that it would not be enough.

“I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter’s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. “What I hope is we’ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.”

Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.

“Twitter’s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets — RT and Sputnik — from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute” for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.

Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability. In September, the company’s vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RT’s three principal Twitter accounts. In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.

On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.

Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter’s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human “trolls” on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.

“I think it’s only a drop in the bucket,” said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “What’s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik’s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn’t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.”

Moreover, Twitter’s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter — and rival social media companies — treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.

A Twitter spokeswoman said the company’s decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.

“This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. “It’s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.”",Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia-today-sputnik.html

Donald Trump is not a problem solver.
“Donald Trump, the president.
Donald Trump, the salesperson.
Donald Trump, the troll.","A few weeks after Trump took office, The New York Post reported that Steve Bannon had identified Cuban as the No. 1 threat for 2020 because he could appeal to Republicans and independents.

“Bannon is a smart man,” smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.

I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautéed frogs’ legs.

But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”

When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent. I mean, I’d rather do it as an independent.” But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban’s neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)

Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?

The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”

He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”

He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.

“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’

“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”

He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.

“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”

Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”

Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.

But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.

He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”

In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.

But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”

I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”

“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)

Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.

Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?

“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.

“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”

He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”

Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.

His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.

Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”

Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.

He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.

“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”

Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.",Mark Cuban’s Not Done Trolling Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/mark-cubans-not-done-trolling-donald-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Confronted with traffic on Interstate 95, he and Mr. Ge decided to take a different route.
Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.
Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.
Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.","“Even today,” Gary R. Brown, the magistrate judge who oversaw the settlement of that crash, wrote in June, the victims were still grappling with “getting on with the difficult process of healing.”

The 50 passengers were from all over: India, Romania, Turkey, Ecuador, Australia as well as New York, New Jersey and California. They included students and sisters-in-law, single friends and married couples. Among them were newlyweds from Algeria.

The three-day excursion, arranged by E-World Travel & Tours, began in Manhattan with a stop planned in Niagara Falls. The tour was meant to head on to Washington and then to Philadelphia, but the bus broke down in upstate New York, forcing the passengers to wait for hours at a shopping mall until a replacement, a 1996 Setra, showed up.

The whirlwind nature of the trip was magnified by the tight schedule set by E-World and the breakneck pace kept by the Setra’s driver, Jinli Zhao, whose erratic driving had unnerved many passengers.

Mr. Zhao seemed irritated, angry, even rude, often rushing the passengers at rest stops, some of them later reported. At least once when a passenger returned late to the bus, Mr. Zhao began to drive away, as though he meant to leave them, one passenger told the police.

Mr. Zhao also seemed distracted behind the wheel. He would eat while driving, passengers recalled. He argued frequently with the tour guide and constantly downed energy drinks. And he was frequently on his cellphone, they said.

He veered near cars in adjacent lanes, accelerated dangerously and then stepped on the brakes, passengers said, cutting off other vehicles. He shifted lanes at such high speed that one passenger said he felt the bus swaying back and forth.

The tour guide, Allan Ge, told the passengers that Mr. Zhao had not slept in a while, Melis Seker, a Turkish college student who was then 19, later told the police. Mr. Ge told the group that “if the police ever stopped the bus and found that the driver had not had enough sleep, then they would be forced to stay and rest,” Ms. Seker said.

The crash occurred on a stretch of roadway in Delaware that investigators said the driver was unfamiliar with. Confronted with traffic on Interstate 95, he and Mr. Ge decided to take a different route. Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.

As they pulled onto the ramp, several people stood up and shouted for the driver to slow down, one passenger told the police. When the bus began to tip, luggage tumbled from the overhead racks. People started screaming.

An Algerian man, Karim Fellahi, who was with his wife, Ihssene Kerchouche, on their honeymoon, remembered seeing the driver lose control.

“I just had the time to say to Ihssene, ‘Be ready for the impact,’” Mr. Fellahi, 36, testified, “because we were sure that we are going to die. We closed our eyes and we waited to die.”

The bus was off the road now, careening into a sloping area of bushes. It went upside-down, turned on its roof and skidded partway down a grassy embankment, rolling again and landing with a shudder on the driver’s side.

Moments later, Mr. Fellahi said, he opened his eyes to a barely identifiable structure. “I couldn’t recognize the roof,” he said. Ms. Kerchouche, 29, had disappeared; even her seat was gone.

“I heard her screaming my name,” Mr. Fellahi said. “It was like she was far, very far, from me.”

He found his wife outside the bus, facedown in the dirt and covered by other passengers. Her mangled right forearm was dangling, connected to the rest of her arm by a piece of skin.

Another passenger testified that she and her sister were propelled through the air at the moment of the crash, flying forward and slamming into people and broken bus parts.

She could not move her arms or legs and felt an unbearable pain in her pelvis, which had been fractured by a large piece of metal.

The Delaware State Police arrived to a scene of carnage: a twisted metal shell and dozens of bodies strewn around it. A 400-foot-long trail of tire marks streaked across the road.

As passengers struggled to escape, Eyup Bahsi, a 30-year-old Turkish man, looked in vain for his wife, Idil. Also 30, she had been sitting in the window seat beside him. Mr. Bahsi finally found her, conscious and seated with her legs pinned underneath the bus. She was trying to pull herself free.

Ms. Bahsi was also having trouble breathing, Mr. Bahsi said, and he gently helped her lie on her back. He tried to clear her mouth of dirt.

She squeezed his hand, opened and closed her eyes and tried to speak, but Mr. Bahsi said that he could not make out the words. He sought to reassure his wife, telling her to just stay calm, that an ambulance was on its way. Ms. Bahsi eventually reached a hospital, where she underwent several operations. She died later that night.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the crash was excessive speed. Mr. Zhao, the driver, claimed that he was feeling ill before the crash and had “blacked out.” But the safety board said that the evidence suggested he was not incapacitated.

The board eventually determined that Mr. Zhao had driven a total of 14¾ hours that Saturday, exceeding the 10-hour federal limit. He also did not have the requisite eight hours off before he set out on the road again.

The board found that the driver’s cellphone records showed he was routinely making and receiving calls and was using his voice mail when the bus was moving, although not when it crashed.

Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.

This month, when a reporter visited his apartment in Queens, Mr. Zhao loomed silently in the background as a young man, who did not give his name but said he was Mr. Zhao’s son, stood in the doorway. He said his father was so “scarred” by the crash that he hardly spoke of it, even to his family.

“What’s past is past,” the son added.

During the litigation, Mr. Zhao was deposed by victims’ lawyers. He testified that when he arrived from New York to fetch the tour group in the Setra, he informed the guide, Mr. Ge, that he was already “very tired.” Mr. Zhao said he had explained to Mr. Ge that if they kept to their plan, his hours would be “a lot over the limit.” He said that Mr. Ge responded there was “nothing he could do.”

In an interview, Mr. Ge said that he did not recall Mr. Zhao looking “really tired.” An E-World supervisor, David Lo, described the travel agency as “an innocent victim” in the crash. “We cannot control the driver,” Mr. Lo said. “We cannot control the bus company.”

The bus was insured for $5 million — the minimum required by law. The insurers filed court papers saying they anticipated that the claims from the crash would exceed their policies, and they ultimately deposited the full $5 million with the court and left Judge Brown to allocate it.

Lawyers for the victims said that this approach, while hardly ideal, was nonetheless their best chance to compensate their clients. The lawyers had learned that AM USA Express had sold its remaining three buses and gone out of business; E-World, they said, also had few assets.

The process was designed to avoid a lengthy court fight, but because the pool of money was limited, it meant that if some passengers got more, others would get less. “On a certain level, it’s a zero-sum game,” said Brian M. Levy, a lawyer for 21 of the claimants.

In order to understand the impact of the crash, Judge Brown held two days of investigative hearings in April. What had previously been a dry legal matter suddenly became excruciatingly human.

Around 10:30 a.m. on April 26, several of the victims — some having traveled from continents away — filed into the courtroom in Central Islip, N.Y. Judge Brown had set out boxes of tissues, and as the day went on, he stopped the proceedings several times to apologize.

“I understand this was a horrific event,” he said, “and we’re going to do everything we can to get you through this as painlessly as possible.”

The first witness was Shilpa Lagishetty, who told the judge that she had suffered a traumatic injury to her right eye socket. Even after surgery, Ms. Lagishetty said, she had constant headaches and could no longer see things that were more than two feet away.

There had also been an emotional toll. “I still have sleepless nights,” she said. On the morning of the crash, she recounted, a woman had asked her to swap seats; she did. The woman died in the crash, she said, beginning to cry.

“I’m so depressed,” she added. “That lady had a son. I can’t imagine me in that position.”

Addressing the judge next was Mr. Bahsi, who had flown to New York from Turkey. He spoke through an interpreter, recounting how his wife had been trapped beneath the bus and died that night in the hospital.

“She was my everything,” he said, “and she was my best friend and she was my best companion.” He added: “It’s difficult. It’s — you know, to come as two individuals and to go back basically with a coffin.”

The next to testify were the Algerian honeymooners, Ms. Kerchouche and Mr. Fellahi. After the crash, Ms. Kerchouche had numerous surgeries as doctors struggled to repair her right arm, which had suffered extensive nerve and vascular damage, and her other injuries. She ultimately faced several hundred thousand dollars in medical bills. Unable to travel, she and Mr. Fellahi had to stay in the United States for more than four months as she recovered. Ms. Kerchouche, who worked for a bank, could not return to work.

Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy. But she could not hold her child, she testified, because one of her arms was permanently locked at a 90-degree angle. Nor could she write, drive a car or turn a door handle, she said. In time, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic-stress disorder.

“She’s like living, but dead in the same time,” her husband told the judge.

Ms. Seker, the Turkish college student, was unable to come to court, but she sent a letter to her lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, who read it to the judge. In the letter, Ms. Seker said the crash’s impact on her life had been endless. She was in constant pain — the crash broke both of her shoulders and some of her ribs, and she was left with a collapsed lung and other fractures. She had nightmares and was now afraid to sleep.

“Sometimes,” she wrote, “I wake up and feel like I am being thrown, like I was on the bus.”

In a recent interview, Ms. Seker said that before the crash, she had been training to be a competitive swimmer and also loved playing volleyball. Now she cannot engage in either sport.

“They said probably I will never be able to do them again,” she said. Like Ms. Kerchouche, she had also stayed in the United States for more than a month to recover, in her case forcing her to miss a semester of school.

In the courtroom, Judge Brown appeared perplexed by the challenge of comparing these cases.

“How do I do this?” he asked Ms. Seker’s lawyer, Mr. Merson. The judge cited Ms. Kerchouche’s case, mentioning her damaged arm. “She can’t hold her baby,” he said. “She can’t feel anything.”",‘Everyone Lost Something’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/bus-crash-underinsured-victims-compensation.html

In “Parents,” Ms. Chiang wrote about her father:

hey! That dude was some snappy dresser.

during the war, they let him work

the navy yards as an apprentice steelwelder

but when the soldiers came home

laundry customers called him Charlie.

(“Charlie” was almost certainly a reference to the fictional detective Charlie Chan, who was considered by many a racist Chinese stereotype.)

Fay Ping Chiang was born in the Bronx on Jan. 27, 1952. While attending Hunter College in Manhattan, she became active in the movement against the Vietnam War and worked with student groups to establish Asian-American studies courses and programs at Hunter and other colleges in the City University of New York system.

But she left college; as the eldest daughter, she was expected to care for her father, who was dying of cancer, and run the laundry. She eventually graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan with a degree in illustration.

In the mid-1970s, Ms. Chiang took the first of what would be a series of jobs with nonprofit groups when she became executive director of the Basement Workshop in Chinatown, a social and cultural organization that mainly served the Asian-American arts community.

“She was a steadfast believer that cultural and educational work was the key to activism,” John Kuo Wei Tchen, a historian at New York University and founding director of the university’s Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute, wrote in an email. “She always talked about people needing to realize they had choices and could get unstuck in their lives.”

After a dozen years with the Basement Workshop, Ms. Chiang worked at the Henry Street Settlement’s outreach program; in New York Newsday’s public affairs department; at Project Reach, a youth program based in Chinatown; and Poets & Writers, a readings and workshop program.

In recent years she had painted dozens of portraits of people, many of them youngsters, who were killed by law enforcement.

“I think people need to see the faces of these young people,” Ms. Chiang told the news website DNAinfo in 2015 when she exhibited the portraits at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts on West 39th Street in Manhattan.

In addition to her daughter, Ms. Chiang is survived by her sisters, Jean and Janice Chiang. She never married. Her brother, Peter, died in 1982.

Ms. Chiang documented the toll that metastatic breast cancer had taken on her in “Landmarks and Geography,” a 2012 poem that opens with a list of each surgery and each tumor, node and breast that had been removed from her. Despite three tumors still in one lung, sciatica coursing from her spine to her toes and pain from scars, she wrote that she felt joy at still standing and

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

But I was one once, as were most of my female friends. In recent weeks, we’ve started to look back at our early career experiences in a new light. There are the painful memories of unwanted advances and hotel room invitations. And then there are the smaller moments that make up a larger narrative, one that can be hard to see when you’re just trying to live through it: the supervisor who stands too close at happy hour and peers down your shirt; the boss who grills you for questions about your romantic life; the promise of mentorship that, you realize only in retrospect, was imbued with something less innocent.

Stories of sexual harassment are almost always more complicated than the way they are represented in news coverage, and they don’t exist in a vacuum but as part of a broader culture. The incidents themselves don’t have to be traumatizing in the moment for them to accrue, over time, into a toxic pattern that hobbles a woman’s career.

A sexual harasser can do untold damage to woman’s self-esteem, forcing her to leave her job or even her profession. But that’s not the only pernicious outcome: She might tolerate the sexual harasser because at least he has been nice to her or taken an interest in her career. His offenses may seem minor amid the other frustrations that she suspects might have something to do with sexism but can’t ever be sure of, like the boss who’s casually dismissive of her every idea, or the mentor who feels he must tear her apart to bring out her true genius.

It can be hard sometimes, for both men and women, to fully understand what the right professional distance should be. But the problem is only compounded by the lack of more experienced women in positions of power to mentor their young counterparts.

In the days since the accusations against Mr. Wieseltier have gone public, I have been talking with former colleagues and replaying years of uncomfortable moments in my head, not just with him, but of everything from unwanted kisses to inappropriate comments and looks. None of it seemed worth reporting at the time. But now I am thinking about how those situations might have shaped the decisions I made, and the way I viewed myself as a professional. I know I am not the only one.

These small events have a way of adding up to a sense of displacement. It becomes harder and harder for a woman to look into the power structures she aspires to join and see herself as belonging — especially when there are so few women there to serve as examples. Even when there are other women at a similar level, being at the bottom rung of these organizations can be a very lonely place.

When a young woman is in a workplace where she feels replaceable, it is particularly dangerous for her to work with someone who is treated as utterly irreplaceable. Politics, like the arts, is full of men like this — so powerful that they become both synonymous with institutions and above them. In that kind of environment, it is not surprising that a man might feel entitled to take advantage, and a woman might feel there’s no recourse.

Lately, we are seeing something of a self-reckoning among well-meaning men. Speaking about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, his longtime collaborator, the director Quentin Tarantino, confessed, “I knew enough to do more than I did.” In Slate, the “Parts Unknown” host Anthony Bourdain wondered, “Why was I not the sort of person, or why was I not seen as the sort of person, that these women could feel comfortable confiding in?” Of Mr. Wieseltier, one former editor told HuffPost, “I accept I was blind and complicit and just, like, did nothing.”

All of this self-flagellation is heartening, particularly to women not accustomed to being believed or who have been told to just get over it. But it is not enough.

Real change will require the willingness of men to promote women and share power. It will mean more than promoting one woman and encouraging the other female employees to be more like her. It will mean investing in and promoting the women you work with and realizing that while many employees are talented yet also complicated and flawed, women are usually the only ones who suffer for it.

Granted, not all chief executives are fonts of wisdom. And some of them, as headlines regularly remind us, are deeply challenged people.

That said, there’s no arguing that C.E.O.s have a rare vantage point for spotting patterns about management, leadership and human behavior.

After almost a decade of writing the Corner Office column, this will be my final one — and from all the interviews, and the five million words of transcripts from those conversations, I have learned valuable leadership lessons and heard some great stories. Here are some standouts.

So You Want to Be a C.E.O.?

It’s a natural impulse. In this age of Moneyball and big data, why not look for patterns?

The problem is that the world doesn’t really work that way. There are too many variables, many of them beyond your control, including luck, timing and personal chemistry.

The career trajectories of the C.E.O.s I’ve interviewed are so varied that spotting trends is difficult, and a surprising number of the executives do not fit the stereotype of the straight-A student and class president who seemed destined to run a big company someday. I’ve met C.E.O.s who started out in theater, music and teaching. Others had surprisingly low grades in school.

So what explains it? Are there some qualities — beyond the obvious, like hard work and perseverance — that explain why these people ultimately got the top jobs?

I’ve noticed three recurring themes.

First, they share a habit of mind that is best described as “applied curiosity.” They tend to question everything. They want to know how things work, and wonder how they can be made to work better. They’re curious about people and their back stories.

And rather than wondering if they are on the right career path, they make the most of whatever path they’re on, wringing lessons from all their experiences.

“I can find interest in a lot of different things and try to put that to work in a positive way, connecting the dots and considering how the pieces fit together,” said Gregory Maffei, whose background includes a college degree in religious studies, and is now the chief executive of Liberty Media, the giant company with interests in everything from SiriusXM to Formula One racing.

Second, C.E.O.s seem to love a challenge. Discomfort is their comfort zone.

“Usually, I really like whatever the problem is. I like to get close to the fire,” said Arkadi Kuhlmann, a veteran banking chief. “Some people have a desire for that, I’ve noticed, and some people don’t. I just naturally gravitate to the fire. So I think that’s a characteristic that you have, that’s in your DNA.”

The third theme is how they managed their own careers on their way to the top. They focus on doing their current job well, and that earns them promotions.

That may sound obvious. But many people can seem more concerned about the job they want than the job they’re doing.

That doesn’t mean keeping ambition in check. By all means, have career goals, share them with your bosses, and learn everything you can about how the broader business works. And yes, be savvy about company politics (watch out in particular for the show ponies who try to take credit for everything).

But focus on building a track record of success, and people will keep betting on you. “You shouldn’t be looking just to climb the ladder, but be open to opportunities that let you climb that ladder,” said Kim Lubel, the former chief executive of CST Brands, a big operator of convenience stores.

Ms. Lubel’s career twists embody that mind-set in an unusual way. She told me a remarkable story of applying for a job with the Central Intelligence Agency, and then — thinking she didn’t get the job — going to grad school instead. Only later did Ms. Lubel (whose maiden name was Smith) learn that the C.I.A. did try to hire her, but that they had offered the job to a different Kim Smith.

The Most Important Thing About Leadership, Part I

Earl Wilson/The New York Times ‘You shouldn’t be looking just to climb the ladder, but be open to opportunities that let you climb that ladder.’ Kim Lubel, former C.E.O. of CST Brands Read the original interview »

Because leadership is so hard, there is a boundless appetite for somebody to come along and say, “Here’s the one thing you need to know.” Such headlines are the clickbait of business websites.

If only it were that simple. But one thing isn’t necessarily more important than another. And people are, well, complicated. Better to understand leadership as a series of paradoxes.

Leaders, for example, need humility to know what they don’t know, but have the confidence to make a decision amid the ambiguity. A bit of chaos can help foster creativity and innovation, but too much can feel like anarchy. You need to be empathetic and care about people, but also be willing to let them go if they’re dragging down the team. You have to create a sense of urgency, but also have the patience to bring everybody on the team along.

“We think about our values in pairs, and there is a tension or a balance between them,” said Jacqueline Novogratz, chief executive of Acumen Fund, a venture philanthropy organization that focuses on the world’s poor. “We talk about listening and leadership; accountability and generosity; humility and audacity. You’ve got to have the humility to see the world as it is — and in our world, working with poor communities, that’s not easy to do — but have the audacity to know why you are trying to make it be different, to imagine the way it could be.”

The Most Important Thing About Leadership, Part II

Go ahead. Twist my arm.

Despite what I just wrote, if you were to force me to rank the most important qualities of effective leadership, I would put trustworthiness at the top.

We all have a gut sense of our bosses, based on our observations and experiences: Do we trust them to do the right thing? Will they be straight with us and not shave corners of truth? Do they own their mistakes; give credit where credit is due; care about their employees as people as opposed to assets? Do they manage down as well as up?

“If you want to lead others, you’ve got to have their trust, and you can’t have their trust without integrity,” said James Hackett, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company, who ran Steelcase when I spoke with him.

A close cousin of trustworthiness is how much you respect the people who work for you. It’s hard to argue with this logic from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood executive:

“By definition if there’s leadership, it means there are followers, and you’re only as good as the followers,” he said. “I believe the quality of the followers is in direct correlation to the respect you hold them in. It’s not how much they respect you that is most important. It’s actually how much you respect them. It’s everything.”

Discussions about different aspects of leadership sometimes remind me of Russian nesting dolls, because many of the qualities can feel like subsets of one another. But I keep going back to first principles of how we’re wired as human beings — we can sense at a kind of lizard-brain level whether we trust someone.

“Human beings are incredibly perceptive,” Pedro J. Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, a public utility holding company. “And they seem to be more perceptive when they look at people above them than when they look down.”

‘Culture Is Almost Like a Religion’

Earl Wilson/The New York Times ‘People seeing who succeeds and fails in the company defines culture. The people who succeed become role models for what’s valued in the organization, and that defines culture.’ Tae Hea Nahm, managing director of Storm Ventures Read the original interview »

It’s a predictable rite of passage as many companies evolve. At some point, the leadership team will go through the exercise of defining a set of values to shape the culture of their company. These lists can be all over the place — lengthy or brief, predictable or quirky.

But the exercise raises an obvious question: Are there some best practices? I have noticed some patterns.

Shorter is generally better than longer. In fact, when I ask chief executives about their companies’ values, it’s not unusual for them to struggle to remember them all if there are more than five bullet points. And if the boss can’t remember them, will anyone else?

Granted, others might disagree with me on this point, including Ray Dalio, founder of the massive Bridgewater Associates hedge fund, who has hundreds of principles for working at his firm. But here’s a thought experiment: What if every company that has codified its values conducted a pop quiz with employees to see if they know them all?

Values need reinforcement beyond repetition. Many companies, for example, make their values part of the hiring and firing process, and hand out awards to people who bring the values to life. “The culture is almost like a religion,” said Robert L. Johnson, chairman of the RLJ Companies, an investment firm. “People buy into it and they believe in it. And you can tolerate a little bit of heresy, but not a lot.”

Michel Feaster, the chief of Usermind, a customer-engagement software firm, shared an insight about the importance of specificity in the values exercise.

“The best cultural lists are the behaviors you want to cultivate,” she said. “The problem with values like respect and courage is that everybody interprets them differently. They’re too ambiguous and open to interpretation. Instead of uniting us, they can create friction.”

At the end of the day, does the values exercise even matter? Many chief executives don’t believe in them. And Tae Hea Nahm, managing director of Storm Ventures, a venture capital firm, thinks other signals are more powerful.

“No matter what people say about culture, it’s all tied to who gets promoted, who gets raises and who gets fired,” he said. “You can have your stated culture, but the real culture is defined by compensation, promotions and terminations. Basically, people seeing who succeeds and fails in the company defines culture. The people who succeed become role models for what’s valued in the organization, and that defines culture.”

Men vs. Women (Sigh)

Librado Romero/The New York Times ‘You have to be open and alert at every turn to the possibility that you’re about to learn the most important lesson of your life.’ Ruth Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University Read the original interview »

Are there differences in the way men and women lead? I’ve been asked this question countless times. Early on, I looked hard to spot differences. But any generalizations never held up.

Sure, there are differences in the way people lead. But in my experience interviewing executives for the past decade, they are more likely to be driven by other factors, like whether they are introverts or extroverts, more analytical or creative, and even whether they grew up in a large or small family.

That said, there is no doubt that women face much stronger headwinds than men to get the top jobs. And many of those headwinds remain once they become C.E.O.s.

But the actual work of leadership? It’s the same, regardless of whether a man or a woman is in charge. You have to set a vision, build cultural guardrails, foster a sense of teamwork, and make tough calls. All of that requires balancing the endless paradoxes of leadership, and doing it in a way that inspires trust.

A suggestion: I believe it’s time to give the narrative about whether men and women lead differently a rest. Yes, we need to keep talking and writing about why there are so few women in the top ranks. But this trope about different styles of leadership among men and women seems past its expiration date.

And while we’re at it, could everyone agree to drop the predictable questions about how female chief executives juggle family and work? Or start asking men the same questions, too?

I Have Just One Question for You

Ruby Washington/The New York Times ‘By definition if there’s leadership, it means there are followers, and you’re only as good as the followers. I believe the quality of the followers is in direct correlation to the respect you hold them in. It’s not how much they respect you that is most important. It’s actually how much you respect them. It’s everything.’ Jeffrey Katzenberg, Hollywood executive Read the original interview »

A big surprise has been all the different answers I’ve heard to the simple question I’ve posed to each leader: How do you hire? Even in recent weeks, I was still hearing job-interview questions I had never heard before.

Just last month, for instance, Daniel Schwartz, the chief executive of the parent company of Burger King, told me that he likes to ask candidates, “Are you smart or do you work hard?” (Yes, there is a right answer, he said: “You want hard workers. You’d be surprised how many people tell me, ‘I don’t need to work hard, I’m smart.’ Really? Humility is important.”)

Their creativity is no doubt born of necessity. Candidates are so trained to anticipate the usual questions — “What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?” — that C.E.O.s have to come up with bank-shot questions to get around the polished facades.

This has inspired a kind of running game I’ve played with many chief executives: If you could ask somebody only one question, and you had to decide on the spot whether to hire them based on their answer, what would it be?

I’d nominate a question that surfaced during my interview with Bob Brennan, an executive director at CA Technologies, a software firm, who was the chief of Iron Mountain, the records-management company, when I spoke with him.

“I want to know how willing people are to really talk about themselves,” Mr. Brennan said. “So if I ask you, ‘What are the qualities you like least and most in your parents?’ you might bristle at that, or you might be very curious about it, or you’ll just literally open up to me. And obviously if you bristle at that, it’s too vulnerable an environment for you.”

I’ll let the human resources professionals debate whether such a question is out of bounds.

But I’m hard pressed to think of a better crystal ball for predicting how somebody is likely to behave in the weeks, months and years after you hire them. After all, people often adopt the qualities of their parents that they like, and work hard to do the opposite of what they don’t like.

The point is reinforced time and again in my interviews. When I ask executives how their parents have influenced their leadership style, I often hear powerful themes that carry through their lives and careers.

“I grew up in a big Italian family,” said Sharon Napier, the chief executive of Partners + Napier, an ad agency. “Fighting and being loud at the kitchen table was normal. I didn’t realize when you went to somebody else’s house they didn’t argue about something. So I love what I always call creative tension in the agency.”

She added: “I like having a good debate. At first, people think that’s combative. I really want to hear if you have a different opinion. There has to be enough trust to do that.”

My Favorite Story

Earl Wilson/The New York Times ‘I just naturally gravitate to the fire. So I think that’s a characteristic that you have, that’s in your DNA.’ Arkadi Kuhlmann, a veteran banking C.E.O. Read the original interview »

I heard it from Bill Green, who was the chief executive of Accenture, the consulting firm, at the time of our interview. I asked him about his approach to hiring, and near the end of our conversation, he shared this anecdote:

“I was recruiting at Babson College. This was in 1991. The last recruit of the day — I get this résumé. I get the blue sheet attached to it, which is the form I’m supposed to fill out with all this stuff and his résumé attached to the top. His résumé is very light — no clubs, no sports, no nothing. Babson, 3.2. Studied finance. Work experience: Sam’s Diner, references on request.

“It’s the last one of the day, and I’ve seen all these people come through strutting their stuff and they’ve got their portfolios and semester studying abroad. Here comes this guy. He sits. His name is Sam, and I say: ‘Sam, let me just ask you. What else were you doing while you were here?’ He says: Well, Sam’s Diner. That’s our family business, and I leave on Friday after classes, and I go and work till closing. I work all day Saturday till closing, and then I work Sunday until I close, and then I drive back to Babson.’ I wrote, ‘Hire him,’ on the blue sheet. He had character. He faced a set of challenges. He figured out how to do both.”

Mr. Green elaborated on the quality he had just described.

“It’s work ethic,” he said. “You could see the guy had charted a path for himself to make it work with the situation he had. He didn’t ask for any help. He wasn’t victimized by the thing. He just said, ‘That’s my dad’s business, and I work there.’ Confident. Proud.”

Mr. Green added: “You sacrifice and you’re a victim, or you sacrifice because it’s the right thing to do and you have pride in it. Huge difference. Simple thing. Huge difference.”

The story captures a quality I’ve always admired in some people. They own their job, whatever it is.

Best Career and Life Advice

My vote for career advice goes to something I heard from Joseph Plumeri, the vice chairman of First Data, a payments-processing company, and former chief executive of Willis Group Holdings. His biggest career inflection points, he told me, came from chance meetings, giving rise to his advice: “Play in traffic.”

“It means that if you go push yourself out there and you see people and do things and participate and get involved, something happens,” he said. “Both of my great occasions in life happened by accident simply because I showed up.”

Mr. Plumeri learned this lesson firsthand when he was looking for a job while in law school. He was knocking on doors of various firms, including one called Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt. He managed to get an audience with one of the partners, Sandy Weill, who informed the young Mr. Plumeri that this was a brokerage firm, not a law firm.

Despite the awkward moment, something clicked, and Mr. Weill gave him a part-time job. And Mr. Plumeri moved up as the firm evolved into Citigroup, and he spent 32 years there, many of them in top jobs.

“I tell people, just show up, get in the game, go play in traffic,” Mr. Plumeri said. “Something good will come of it, but you’ve got to show up.”

As for life advice, my favorite insight came from Ruth Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University. Her suggestion to students:

“They should never assume that they can predict what experiences will teach them the most about what they value, or about what their life should be,” she said. “You have to be open and alert at every turn to the possibility that you’re about to learn the most important lesson of your life.”

Thanks to everyone who followed Corner Office over the years. I hope you found useful lessons in the interviews — I sure did. And thanks to all the executives who were so candid with me about the challenges they’ve faced and the mistakes they’ve made along the way.

Perhaps their stories will inspire others to learn how to be better leaders. It’s not easy, but the ripple effects of thoughtful leadership are worth the effort.","How to Be a C.E.O., From a Decade’s Worth of Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/how-to-be-a-ceo.html

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

Flake, with Christian (specifically, Mormon) ideals, is giving up his fight for conservative ideals because the behavior he’s seeing on ‘his side’ is contrary to his Christian principles, to common decency.

Horrifying that the atmosphere in our nation has gotten so bad that even a conservative politician whose party is in power is leaving for this reason.

Matters like Lee Harvey Oswald being assassinated in public view by a man with loose mob ties certainly raised suspicions. Over the years many misconceptions have been cleared up, many of those misconceptions put forth by Oliver Stone.

Modern, data-driven testing and continued research of many aspects of the event have pointed to one reasonable conclusion: Oswald acted alone. Probably the only cover-ups were to protect the Secret Service, which absolutely blew it.

And sushi, which is about as endemic to Burmese cuisine as Texas chili, has become their livelihood.

“Sometimes one immigrant breaks through in a big way and creates opportunity for a lot of other people,” said David Dyssegaard Kallick, who studies immigrant entrepreneurship at the Fiscal Policy Institute in New York.

For the Burmese in the sushi business, Philip Maung may have been the one who broke through.

He arrived in the United States in 1989 as a 22-year-old with big ambitions but no money. After the early ’90s recession crippled his dreams of making it big in real estate, Mr. Maung joined Advanced Fresh Concepts, a Southern California company started by a Japanese immigrant who pioneered the supermarket-sushi concept. The formula: The store provides a display case, refrigerator and storage. The company supplies the ingredients and chefs to prepare the rolls on-site.

After a few years running Advanced Fresh stations, Mr. Maung struck out on his own, betting on untapped markets. In 1998, he started Hissho Sushi in Charlotte, N.C., a financial center where he figured he would get a loan.

But Hissho, which means “certain victory” in Japanese, was no easy win.

Banks shunned him. He borrowed $100,000 from friends and family, and maxed out his credit cards. To save money, he slept in his car when he traveled from retailer to retailer pitching the idea of fresh sushi inside their supermarkets, next to deli salads or cupcakes.

It was a tough sell. “Sushi? Give me a break,” he recalled being told. “Americans like pizza and fried chicken.”

But he gradually won over some independent grocers, and by 2001 had sushi bars in 15 stores in Midwestern and Southern states ringing up $2.5 million in sales.

Photo

Hissho grew as the number of Burmese settling in the United States jumped more than tenfold, to about 1,300 in 2004 from just 113 two years earlier. They had fled bloody clashes that for decades pitted the national armed forces against ethnic groups in rural areas fighting for self-determination. In 2007, arrivals rocketed to 14,225 as refugees parked in Malaysia and Thailand were approved for resettlement in the United States.

Hissho swept up many of the newcomers as it expanded. It turned the counters over to the workers once they gained expertise, with the company and the supermarket receiving a cut of the sales.

“It was all by word of mouth,” Mr. Maung said of how he attracted workers from Myanmar.

Today, Hissho has counters in more than 1,100 locations in 41 states, including in national chains like Kroger, university food halls and medical plazas. Mr. Maung projects sales will surpass $140 million this year.

About 95 percent of Mr. Maung’s franchisees, like Mr. Aung in Southern California, are Burmese. They must commit $10,000 in start-up capital and complete a two-week course at the Hissho headquarters before taking over a sushi counter.

On a recent Tuesday in a Hissho classroom, Thant Zin Oo, an instructor, led a discussion in English peppered with Burmese about “how to reconcile the chef’s mind and the business mind.”

Among the 10 pupils planning to run franchises in Colorado, Maryland, Texas and other states, several, like Mr. Aung, had never encountered sushi, let alone Western-style rolls with names like Sriracha Party and Blazing California, before reaching the United States.

“Most of the students are very nervous when they hold sushi rice in their hands” for the first time, said Zhao Zhao Dongmen, another instructor. They press it too hard, and it gets mashed. She advises them to handle the grains “gently, like you are planting grass on the nori,” the dried seaweed sheets that hold the rolls together. Novices are also prone to splurge on fillings, prompting Ms. Dongmen to remind them, “We are making sushi here, not pizza or burrito.”

After leaving Myanmar, Mr. Aung eked out a living for five years peddling garments in Malaysia. He arrived in Kent, Wash., in February 2014, and within a week he was learning the sushi business from his cousin, Nang Moe, a Hissho franchisee, working his bamboo rolling mat until the motions were muscle memory.

A year later, the company invited Mr. Aung to work at its sushi counter in a Sprouts grocery store in Carlsbad, Calif., north of San Diego. He made $11 an hour. Then Hissho offered him a franchise inside the Sprouts in Oceanside, where sales quickly jumped 50 percent, said Pyie Thu, Hissho’s regional manager. Last year, Mr. Thu offered him two more Sprouts stores, the one in Carlsbad where Mr. Aung had worked and another in nearby San Marcos.

He lured fellow Burmese to California, training them to slice salmon and tuna at just the right angle and make perfectly round rolls stuffed with avocado, cucumber and other ingredients. Every one of Mr. Aung’s Burmese protégés has become a franchisee.

Many customers assume that the sushi they are buying is prepared by Japanese chefs, Mr. Aung said, adding that he always tells them the truth if they ask. High quality for value matters much more to them, he said.

From his three counters, Mr. Aung nets $17,000 a month.

A few months ago, his high school sweetheart arrived in the United States — and she promptly began working at his Carlsbad counter. They plan to marry soon and start a family.

His only challenge is that “all the time I am training new people,” he said. “Because when Burmese know sushi, they want their own store.”",Ever Heard of Burmese Sushi Counters? You’ve Probably Been to One,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/burmese-refugees-sushi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Dozens of other Catalan officials were expected to be fired, but Enric Millo, the current representative of the central government in Catalonia, told Catalunya Radio on Saturday that he expected Madrid to make “the minimum possible” staff changes.

Mr. Puigdemont, speaking from the Catalan capital, Barcelona, insisted that Mr. Rajoy was removing a democratically elected government.

“These are decisions contrary to the will expressed by the citizens of our country at the ballot boxes,” he said. He added that the central government in Madrid “knows perfectly well that, in a democratic society, it is the Parliaments that choose or remove presidents.”

Madrid also took control of the regional police force and fired the regional police chief, Maj. Josep Lluís Trapero.

Pere Soler, the ousted director general of the Catalan police force and Major Trapero’s boss, sent a letter to his officers, expressing regret over his removal and thanking them for their work.

Major Trapero, who is facing possible sedition charges after he was accused of failing to stop protesters last month from encircling national police officers, also wrote to his colleagues. He reminded them that their task was to “guarantee the safety of everybody” in the coming days, should the political crisis spur more unrest.

As Mr. Puigdemont spoke on Saturday, throngs of Spaniards gathered in central Madrid — many of them waving flags, some wrapped in them — to protest Catalonia’s unilateral declaration of independence.

“We are resisting xenophobia,” one man said into a microphone, before shouting, “Long live Catalonia, long live the king, long live Spain.”

The crowd chanted: “Don’t lie to us, Catalonia. You are part of Spain.”

Many protesters said that Madrid had to enforce its decision to invoke Article 155. Some said that, if necessary, the army should be sent in, though most said it would not come to that.

“They need to apply the law,” said Chema Martinez, 22, who described himself as a patriot and a Catholic and wore a Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart of Jesus stamped on its center.

“The army is there to defend Spain,” he said. “They should send in the army to Catalonia; that’s what needs to be done.”

At one point, the Spanish national anthem began to play, and many who had been quietly listening as they sat on the curb silently stood up.

Agueda Rivera, 77, tears streaming down her face, said: “I’m crying. I’m crying for my Spain.”

On Friday, Mr. Rajoy announced that new Catalan elections would be held on Dec. 21, the earliest possible date, in an apparent bid to show frustrated Catalans that Madrid wanted to avoid prolonging a constitutional crisis.

By limiting Madrid’s control over Catalonia to 55 days, analysts said, Mr. Rajoy and his allies were hoping to quickly turn the tables on the separatists, who staged an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

“It’s Rajoy’s attempt to regain the democratic initiative, but also a surprisingly risky bet that he can really beat the independence movement,” said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher.

“Whether it works will depend on the level of resistance to Madrid in the coming weeks, which perhaps won’t be that high given that people are exhausted and need a break.”

Albert Rivera, the national leader of Ciudadanos, the party that has been Mr. Rajoy’s main ally in fighting secessionism, told a party conference on Saturday morning, “We will now come out to beat them, but by voting.”

The December elections, he said, were an opportunity for “all the Catalans who have been silenced by nationalism,” after opponents of independence mostly boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum.

“We will now claim the right to vote in freedom,” Mr. Rivera added, “to show the world that this is a free and democratic country.”

Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of the Catalan public television station, TV3, said that it remained to be seen how much practical control Mr. Rajoy could exert over Catalan institutions.

“We live in an uncertain moment,” Mr. Sanchis said in his office. “We now have two parallel legitimacies and we still don’t know which one controls the Catalan institutions.”

“The key thing now is to discover what pressure the Madrid government will now exert,” he added. “In the coming days, we’ll find out.”

Jordi Borda, the deputy director of Catalunya Radio, said a crucial test would come on Monday.

“If the Catalan ministers go to work on Monday and manage to work normally, it will be a strong step towards consolidating what the Catalan Parliament voted on yesterday,” Mr. Borda said.

“If Monday is a normal day,” he said, “it will be a victory for the independence movement.”

Spain’s attorney general is expected to take legal action against Mr. Puigdemont and other leading separatists on Monday, possibly on grounds of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of as long as 30 years.

Joan Queralt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Barcelona, said he expected the attorney general to act forcefully.

“One thing is what the law says and another is how far the government can act,” Professor Queralt said. “I’ve got the feeling that the attorney general will do whatever he wants, just as happens when governments deal with terrorists.”",Catalonia’s Ousted Leader Calls for Peaceful Defiance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html

Several lawmakers and witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in June on whether to replace the 9/11 war authorization law criticized his claim as stretching the 2001 law too far.","Previous efforts collapsed under disagreements between lawmakers opposed to restricting the executive branch’s interpretation of its current wartime powers and those unwilling to vote for a new blank check for a forever war. Among the disputes: whether a replacement should have an expiration date, constrain the use of ground forces, limit the war’s geographic scope and permit the government to start attacking other militant groups merely associated with the major enemies it would name.

Adding to the political headwinds, two of the Republican lawmakers most interested in drafting a new war authorization law are lame ducks and estranged from the White House: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has proposed a new war authorization bill with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Both Republican senators, who have announced that they will not seek re-election, have publicly denounced Mr. Trump in recent weeks as dangerously unfit to be the commander in chief.

But as the 9/11 war enters its 17th year, questions about the scope and limits of presidential war-making powers are taking on new urgency.

Mr. Trump is giving the Pentagon and the C.I.A. broader latitude to pursue counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids away from traditional battlefields. Two government officials said Mr. Trump had recently signed his new rules for such kill-or-capture counterterrorism operations, without major changes to an interagency agreement first described last month by The New York Times.

Under the Obama-era rules, there was individualized high-level vetting of proposed strikes, and targets had to pose a specific threat, as individuals, to Americans. Under the new Trump rules, the administration will instead approve a “persistent campaign of direct action” for various countries where Islamist militants are operating, without higher-level review of particular strikes, and targets may include any suspected member of a group deemed covered by the 9/11 war authorization.

And while the Trump administration decided to keep an Obama-era requirement of “near certainty” that no civilians would be killed, it reduced the required level of confidence that the intended target was present in a strike zone from “near certainty” to “reasonable certainty,” one official said — further lowering constraints on attacks.

Moreover, NBC News reported this past week that the Trump administration was exploring arming the surveillance drones that now fly over Niger and Mali in search of suspected Islamist militants. The new rules could also permit the Pentagon to carry out offensive ground combat operations in North and West Africa, escalating deployments that key lawmakers seem to have been only dimly aware of before the deaths of the four soldiers this month.

“I didn’t know there was a thousand troops in Niger,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Mr. Graham opposes rewriting the 9/11 war authorization law but wanted more information about what the government is doing with it, saying: “This is an endless war without boundaries, no limitation on time and geography. You got to tell us more.”

The questions about Mr. Trump’s interpretation of his war powers range beyond conventional counterterrorism operations.

For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that he may abandon diplomatic efforts to curb North Korea’s testing of nuclear bombs and longer-range missiles and order an attack. But he and his administration have said nothing suggesting that they would seek prior authorization from Congress and the United Nations Security Council.

On April 6, Mr. Trump ordered airstrikes against Syrian government forces as punishment for using chemical weapons, without going to Congress or the United Nations for permission. His administration refused to answer questions about why it thought he had lawful authority to carry out such an act of war unilaterally, especially as a matter of international law, leaving it unclear whether it had first considered potential legal constraints.

A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently revealed that Mr. Trump’s legal team did draft and internally circulate a seven-page, unsigned memo analyzing a legal basis for potential military action against Syria. While the memo is undated, Justice Department lawyers said it was probably produced on April 6, the day of the strikes.

But the administration is keeping the memo’s contents secret, so it is not clear what, if anything, it says about international law. The United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United States, forbids attacking another sovereign country without Security Council permission or a self-defense claim.

View all New York Times newsletters.

It is also not clear whether the memo’s analysis of domestic law claimed constitutional power for Mr. Trump to lawfully attack Syria merely because he decided that it would be in the national interest — as a set of leaked administration talking points maintained — or whether it invoked the 9/11 war authorization law as purported congressional sanction.

But in June, after the United States military shot down a Syrian government fighter jet — prompting Russia to threaten to shoot down any American aircraft that flew west of the Euphrates River — the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., asserted that the executive branch’s legal authority to attack the Syrian jet came from the 9/11 war authorization law.

General Dunford’s rationale was that the American presence in Syria stemmed from its fight against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State under that law, and that the jet had been menacing a rebel militia the United States was supporting. Several lawmakers and witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in June on whether to replace the 9/11 war authorization law criticized his claim as stretching the 2001 law too far.

The existence of the April 6 memo came to light via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group founded by former Obama administration lawyers. On Thursday, the group filed a new lawsuit for documents that could similarly reveal whether the Trump administration has developed any analysis about a legal basis for a potential pre-emptive attack on North Korea.

Protect Democracy’s executive director, Ian Bassin, said the Senate should ask the top Trump administration witnesses on Monday to explain their understanding of Mr. Trump’s powers to unilaterally start or expand wars beyond those linked to the much-stretched 9/11 war authorization law.

“Senator Corker may be worried about the lack of adult day care in the White House, but the framers actually assigned those duties to Congress,” Mr. Bassin said, invoking the chairman’s rejoinder to Mr. Trump’s insults on Twitter earlier this month. “With a commander in chief unilaterally launching missiles at Syria and threatening nuclear war against North Korea, Corker needs to focus on more than an Islamic State A.U.M.F. He needs to put safety bumpers around the president.”",Will Congress Ever Limit the Forever-Expanding 9/11 War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/aumf-congress-niger.html

Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for. I’m afraid you’d better bite down and pay up.",My Wife Found My Sexy Phone Pics and Won’t Let It Go,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/my-wife-found-my-sexy-phone-pics-and-wont-let-it-go.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They stay in motel rooms, often far enough from the events to avoid detection, or on campgrounds after trading suggestions on Facebook, Gab and Twitter.

Alt-right supporters headed on Saturday morning to a “White Lives Matter” rally in Shelbyville, in Central Tennessee. Another rally had been planned for the afternoon in nearby Murfreesboro, but was canceled. Organizers chose the region to protest the resettlement of refugees in the area, and to call attention to the shooting last month at a predominantly white church that killed one person and injured several others. The man jailed in the shooting, who is black, left a note that referred to Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

In preparation for the rallies, Occidental Dissent, a website popular among white nationalists, offered recommendations and guidelines on topics including attire (white or black polo shirts and khakis “to make a good impression”) and chants (“Blood and Soil!”), as well as a preview of a private event described as “a time to relax, socialize and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people in our movement after two hours of pro-White activism.”

On Friday, about 20 demonstrators, including Harry Hughes from Arizona, had dinner together at an Olive Garden.

“I come to these events routinely because I think we have a message, and we also look for reaction from the public,” said Mr. Hughes, a member of a neo-Nazi group, adding that he often includes sightseeing on his trips.

Zaine Deal, a Traditional Workers Party member from Ohio who was making a quicker trip to the South, said he and 10 other men had driven to Tennessee on Friday for the weekend’s events and planned to leave on Sunday. They split two hotel rooms.

“We’re guys,” a helmet-wearing Mr. Deal, 18, said at the Shelbyville rally on Saturday. “We’re usually arguing about who gets to sleep on the floor.”

Mr. Deal said he planned to travel for more events to advance the same strains of ideology that apparently led the three men from Texas this month to Florida, where they remained jailed on bonds of at least $1 million each.

The Texas men had growing histories as activists who were willing to travel from their homes in the Houston area to support the alt-right, and all three attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly when, according to the police, a white nationalist from Ohio drove his car into a crowd. One of the men arrested in Florida, William H. Fears, had also surfaced at other events, including at least three in Texas, according to news and social media accounts of the events.

A few hours before the shooting, Mr. Fears, who faces a charge of attempted homicide, spoke to The Gainesville Sun about what he depicted as the movement’s newfound aggression.

“We’re starting to push back, we’re starting to want to intimidate back,” he told the newspaper. “We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we’re not to be taken lightly. We don’t want violence, we don’t want harm, but at the end of the day, we’re not opposed to defending ourselves.”

On Friday, asked about the charges against Mr. Fears and the other men, Mr. Spencer said: “If the allegations are correct, then they really did a bad thing. It’s not defensible, to be honest.”

But Mr. Spencer and his allies have no plans to abandon the events that prompt controversy and turmoil. Brad Griffin, the publisher of Occidental Dissent, estimated that up to 90 percent of people at the alt-right’s public events are regulars who travel from afar, a figure Mr. Spencer agreed with. Mr. Griffin said that the movement struggled to attract more local support because of the promise of public condemnation.

“We’re breaking a taboo,” said Mr. Griffin, who also oversees public relations for the League of the South, which describes itself as a “Southern nationalist” organization, and who helped promote Saturday’s rallies. “We might have supporters in the area, we might have supporters in the state, but the number of people who are willing to take those risks always reduces turnout.”

The movement’s most fervent activists are often met by left-wing opponents, like those in the Antifa movement, who have a similar, if more extensive, history of traveling. They normally benefit, observers said, from long-established networks that support liberal protesters, sometimes offering meals and couches to crash on.

Starting with the street clashes in Seattle during the World Trade Organization conference in 1999, “you just see this roving band that was at everything,” said Scott Crow, a longtime liberal activist and author who lives in Texas. “You’re probably not seeing the same Antifa people at every Richard Spencer rally, but there are people who are probably at many of those things or the big ones.”

Federal officials have long paid close attention to activists all along the political spectrum, sometimes infiltrating groups they consider extreme. Yet traveling demonstrators, no matter their ideological alignment, often pose particular challenges for the local authorities, who may have little experience handling volatile protests and limited knowledge about people who come from afar.

Social media platforms and the internet only add to the challenge, experts said. While technology yields greater opportunities for intelligence gathering, it also allows for greater coordination among some extremists who, until recently, would have probably stayed close to home.

“They were geographically isolated, they would interact with others and, on occasion, they would travel,” said John D. Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. “What’s different today than, say, five years ago is that more and more people seem to be self-connecting with the cause of white supremacy versus joining a white supremacist group.”

And experts said a blend of easy access and coordination, as well as perceptions of a hands-off approach to policing past rallies, sometimes draws outspoken activists who ordinarily would have remained “underground.”

On the web page with instructions and guidelines for the demonstrations in Tennessee, Mr. Griffin included an admonishment that “another Charlottesville” is “not in our interest.” Rather, one of the weekend’s stated objectives was to “foster greater unity and cohesion within our own movement.”

Mr. Griffin, despite his movement’s record of failing to attract many local supporters, said he was hoping Tennesseans would be more open to their beliefs than Charlottesville residents were.

But in Shelbyville, outside the small area designated for the demonstrators, the streets seemed to be dotted only by police officers, journalists and counter-demonstrators. Mr. Deal, the helmeted Traditional Workers Party member, surveyed the crowd and pointed at his political opponents.

The late Dodgers outburst came after an unlikely pitcher’s duel between the teams’ No. 4 starters, Alex Wood of the Dodgers and Charlie Morton of the Astros. Wood carried a no-hitter into the sixth on Saturday, when Springer produced the game’s first run with his homer. Morton was only slightly less flawless, facing the minimum number of batters through five innings.

Thus far, each game has delivered an unexpected element. Game 1 came with extreme 103-degree heat. Game 2 brought a rare blown save by Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and late, no-quit, home run-fueled comebacks by both teams. And Game 3 was marred by a racist gesture by Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel.

Gurriel’s act, in which he stretched the side of his eyes after hitting a home run off the Dodgers’ Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, provided the backdrop for Game 4.

On Saturday afternoon, Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended Gurriel for five games at the start of the 2018 season, but chose not to discipline him for this Series, in part because he did not want to penalize the rest of the Astros. His decision drew support from Roberts, whose mother is Japanese.

“I think that it gives us all some closure in the sense that it was something that happened,” Roberts said. “The way that it was dealt with, I support.”

Gurriel, who received modest cheers from Astros fans when he came to the plate for his first at-bat on Saturday, was not a factor as Game 4 proceeded. But Bellinger was.

Bellinger, who made his Dodgers debut when veteran Adrian Gonzalez was injured this season, generally carries himself well beyond his years, owing to a reserved personality and the preparation provided by his father, Clay, who won two World Series rings with the Yankees.

“He’s got no pulse; he really doesn’t have a memory, either,” said Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who is 23 and in his third postseason. “He forgets things. Things go away. That’s what you have to do in baseball — you have to forget the past, forget your last AB and move onto the next one. That’s what he did tonight.”

But Bellinger’s breakout night did come with a thought process on his part.

He was hitless in 13 at-bats, including eight strikeouts — four in Game 3 — as he came to the plate with one out in the seventh inning against Morton, who was nursing a 1-0 lead. Earlier, an insight had came to Bellinger when he went out to take batting practice: His teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe regularly hit the ball the opposite way when taking their pregame swings. So why not do the same?

“I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in B.P., and I had never done it and I wanted to try it,” said the left-handed hitting Bellinger, who proceeded to hit every ball to left field during the practice session.

The struggles Bellinger endured in the Series were not unlike those of another ballyhooed rookie — the Yankees’ Aaron Judge — who emerged from a postseason slump midway through the American League Championship Series against the same Astros team Bellinger was now facing.

“I watched and we were identical, striking out a lot, swinging at a lot of off-speed pitches that we don’t normally swing at,” Bellinger said of Judge. “I think that’s the pressure of the postseason sometimes.”

The Astros had put Bellinger in a funk by throwing him back-foot breaking balls and fastballs away — pitches that are difficult to pull. But when Morton threw a 3-2 curveball to him in the seventh, he left it over the plate and Bellinger drove it the opposite way. Left fielder Marwin Gonzalez gave chase, but could not track it down.

As Bellinger coasted into second with a double, he raised his hands and gazed upward as if to give thanks for his first hit of the series.

It was also enough to chase Morton. He had survived the top of the sixth after Astros third baseman Alex Bregman threw Barnes out at home to keep the game scoreless. It was almost identical to a pivotal play Bregman made in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down the Yankees’ Greg Bird at home to preserve a 1-0 lead.

But after Bellinger’s double an inning later, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch had a brief conversation with Morton on the mound and then called on his rested bullpen. Will Harris came on to retire Yasiel Puig on a deep fly to right field, but Forsythe followed by lining a 2-0 fastball for a single that easily scored Bellinger.

The Dodgers weren’t done. In the ninth, Giles — who surrendered a two-run lead in Game 2 — gave up a single to Seager and a walk to Justin Turner. Bellinger followed by driving a 1-0 fastball into the left-center gap for a double that scored Seager and sent Turner to third.

“The double he hit to left-center, he stayed on that curveball pretty good,” Astros catcher Brian McCann said of the first double. “And the one in the ninth, he cheated on the heater.”

They were not the swings of an overmatched youngster, or of someone weighed down by the moment. Instead, they were taken by someone who understood what to remember and what to forget, and the result was a World Series that might end up going the distance.","Cody Bellinger Breaks Through, Leading the Dodgers Past the Astros",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/sports/baseball/world-series-dodgers-astros.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Last Sunday, he won a commanding majority in parliamentary elections, fueling his hopes of revising the nation’s pacifist Constitution.

This brutal calculus over how to respond to North Korea is taking place in a region where several nations have the material, the technology, the expertise and the money to produce nuclear weapons.

Beyond South Korea and Japan, there is already talk in Australia, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam about whether it makes sense to remain nuclear-free if others arm themselves — heightening fears that North Korea could set off a chain reaction in which one nation after another feels threatened and builds the bomb.

In a recent interview, Henry A. Kissinger, one of the few nuclear strategists from the early days of the Cold War still living, said he had little doubt where things were headed.

“If they continue to have nuclear weapons,” he said of North Korea, “nuclear weapons must spread in the rest of Asia.”

“It cannot be that North Korea is the only Korean country in the world that has nuclear weapons, without the South Koreans trying to match it. Nor can it be that Japan will sit there,” he added. “So therefore we’re talking about nuclear proliferation.”

Such fears have been raised before, in Asia and elsewhere, without materializing, and the global consensus against the spread of nuclear weapons is arguably stronger than ever.

But North Korea is testing America’s nuclear umbrella — its commitment to defend its allies with nuclear weapons if necessary — in a way no nation has in decades. Similar fears of abandonment in the face of the Soviet Union’s growing arsenal helped lead Britain and France to go nuclear in the 1950s.

President Trump, who leaves Nov. 3 for a visit to Asia, has intensified these insecurities in the region. During his presidential campaign, he spoke openly of letting Japan and South Korea build nuclear arms even as he argued they should pay more to support the American military bases there.

“There is going to be a point at which we just can’t do this anymore,” he told The New York Times in March 2016. Events, he insisted, were pushing both nations toward their own nuclear arsenals anyway.

Mr. Trump has not raised that possibility in public since taking office. But he has rattled the region by engaging in bellicose rhetoric against North Korea and dismissing talks as a “waste of time.”

In Seoul and Tokyo, many have already concluded that North Korea will keep its nuclear arsenal, because the cost of stopping it will be too great — and they are weighing their options.

Capability to Build the Bomb

Long before North Korea detonated its first nuclear device, several of its neighbors secretly explored going nuclear themselves.

Japan briefly considered building a “defensive” nuclear arsenal in the 1960s despite its pacifist Constitution. South Korea twice pursued the bomb in the 1970s and 1980s, and twice backed down under American pressure. Even Taiwan ran a covert nuclear program before the United States shut it down.

Today, there is no question that both South Korea and Japan have the material and expertise to build a weapon.

All that is stopping them is political sentiment and the risk of international sanctions. Both nations signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but it is unclear how severely other countries would punish two of the world’s largest economies for violating the agreement.

South Korea has 24 nuclear reactors and a huge stockpile of spent fuel from which it can extract plutonium — enough for more than 4,300 bombs, according to a 2015 paper by Charles D. Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists.

Japan once pledged never to stockpile more nuclear fuel than it can burn off. But it has never completed the necessary recycling and has 10 tons of plutonium stored domestically and another 37 tons overseas.

“We keep reminding the Japanese of their pledge,” said Ernest J. Moniz, chief executive of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and an energy secretary in the Obama administration, noting that it would take years if not decades for Japan to consume its fissile material because almost all its nuclear plants have remained offline since the 2011 Fukushima accident.

China, in particular, has objected to Japan’s stockpile, warning that its traditional rival is so advanced technologically that it could use the material to quickly build a large arsenal.

Analysts often describe Japan as a “de facto” nuclear state, capable of building a weapon within a year or two. “Building a physical device is not that difficult anymore,” said Tatsujiro Suzuki, former deputy chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission.

Japan already possesses long-range missile technology, he added, but would need some time to develop more sophisticated communications and control systems.

South Korea may be even further along, with a fleet of advanced missiles that carry conventional warheads. In 2004, the government disclosed that its scientists had dabbled in reprocessing and enriching nuclear material without first informing the International Atomic Energy Agency as required by treaty.

“If we decide to stand on our own feet and put our resources together, we can build nuclear weapons in six months,” said Suh Kune-yull, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University. “The question is whether the president has the political will.”

In Seoul, a Rising Call for Arms

President Moon Jae-in has been firm in his opposition to nuclear weapons. He insists that building them or reintroducing American ones to South Korea would make it even more difficult to persuade North Korea to scrap its own.

Though Mr. Moon has received high approval ratings since his election in May, his view is increasingly a minority one.

Calls for nuclear armament used to be dismissed as chatter from South Korea’s nationalist fringe. Not anymore. Now people often complain that South Korea cannot depend on the United States, its protector of seven decades.

The opposition Liberty Korea party called on the United States to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea in August after the North tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of reaching the mainland United States.

“If the U.N. Security Council can’t rein in North Korea with its sanctions, we will have no option but to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty,” Won Yoo-chul, a party leader, said in September.

Given the failure of sanctions, threats and negotiations to stop North Korea, South Koreans are increasingly convinced the North will never give up its nuclear weapons. But they also oppose risking a war with a military solution.

Most believe the Trump administration, despite its tough talk, will ultimately acquiesce, perhaps settling for a freeze that allows the North to keep a small arsenal. And many fear that would mean giving the North the ultimate blackmail tool — and a way to keep the United States at bay.

“The reason North Korea is developing a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles is not to go to war with the United States,” said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “It’s to stop the Americans from intervening in armed skirmishes or full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula.”

The closer the North gets to showing it can strike the United States, the more nervous South Koreans become about being abandoned. Some have asked whether Washington will risk the destruction of an American city by intervening, for example, if the North attempts to occupy a border island, as its soldiers have practiced.

For many in South Korea, the solution is a homegrown nuclear deterrent.

“If we don’t respond with our own nuclear deterrence of some kind, our people will live like nuclear hostages of North Korea,” said Cheon Seong-whun, a former presidential secretary for security strategy.

With nuclear weapons of its own, the South would gain leverage and could force North Korea back to the bargaining table, where the two sides could whittle down their arsenals through negotiations, some hawks argue.

But given the risks of going nuclear, others say Seoul should focus on persuading Washington to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons.

“The redeployment of American tactical nuclear weapons would be the surest way” to deter North Korea, Defense Minister Song Young-moo said last month, but he added that it would be difficult to get Washington to agree to that.

In Tokyo, Cautious Debate

The discussion in Japan has been more subdued than in South Korea, no surprise after 70 years of public education about the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

But Japan has periodically considered developing nuclear weapons every decade since the 1960s.

In 2002, a top aide to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister then, caused a furor by suggesting Japan might one day break with its policy of never building, possessing or allowing nuclear arms on its territory.

North Korea has reopened that question.

Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister seen as a potential challenger to Prime Minister Abe, has argued that Japan needs to debate its nuclear policy given the threat from North Korea.

Mr. Abe has stopped short of calling for a re-evaluation of the country’s position on nuclear weapons. But he has increased military spending and echoed Mr. Trump’s hawkish position against the North.

Mr. Abe’s administration has already determined that nuclear weapons would not be prohibited under the Constitution if maintained only for self-defense.

The Japanese public is largely opposed to nuclear weapons with polls indicating fewer than one in 10 support nuclear armament.

But Japan’s relations with South Korea have long been strained, and if Seoul armed itself, those numbers could shift.

Some analysts say the discussion is aimed at getting additional reassurance from Washington. “We always do that when we become a little upset about the credibility of the extended U.S. deterrence,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.

Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy, said Japan would rethink its position on nuclear weapons if it suspects the United States would let it down.

“We’re kind of in uncharted waters as far as this goes,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly what the threshold is that will lead the Japanese public’s switch to flip.”",North Korea Rouses Neighbors to Reconsider Nuclear Weapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-japan-south-korea.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The dinner parties started years ago in an unfinished loft in industrial Brooklyn: chickens cooked in a balky oven and served on a banged-up old table someone found on the street. My wife and I were unmarried then, childless, but already, it seemed, in the process of building a sort of home, the sort we wanted to live in, where there’s always something happening in the kitchen, always a lot of people bustling about and always an extra seat for whoever’s around: friends from college, from work, from the bar. We’d put the call out on a weekend morning: You free for dinner? Then make a salad to go with the meat, roast some potatoes with onions and rosemary, slide a few baguettes onto the table, serve a lot of wine. We did this often enough that the eating became not just simple sustenance but instead a kind of rolling weekly party of six people, eight, 10, informal and slightly disorganized, our room filled with conversation and good cheer. Eventually the calls started coming in rather than going out: You cooking tonight?

Later we cooked in an airy apartment a few miles north, next to a candle factory that filled the air with strange vanilla scents: big feeds of shredded pork or brisket and heaps of steamed greens, as babies slept in their car seats next to their parents’ chairs. We were a family by then, in fact as much as spirit. We moved the babies east, to a tiny old house on the end of Long Island where we would put a dozen or more people around a table for eight to eat epic meals of clams and corn, ribs and rice. Arms got tangled as people who sometimes hardly knew one another reached for the food. Someone put a name to that, to the way you’d have to snake your arm under someone else’s just to get to the butter, the salad, a bottle, the salt: the boardinghouse reach.

Table Talk Go for empathy when you talk politics. Showing how a political issue affects you intimately is more important than data and statistics. Try leading with a personal story.

We took the boardinghouse reach to dinners in Connecticut after that, where we simmered chili and cooked fragrant roast lamb and served it outside on a picnic table under towering oaks after picking up friends at the train. We took it to Maine, where we cooked on a wood stove and ate over a plywood table lighted with kerosene lamps: cod cakes, slaw, chicken paprikash. We reached across tables on sticky urban roofs under the night sky, in suburban yards under string lights, in rooms that were small and dingy, large and luxurious. We cooked for family real and imagined, usually casually, occasionally formally, ideally somewhere between the two. The point was just to cook — or, more accurate, the point was just to get people to gather around a table and eat, and to do so regularly enough that they knew that it would happen again soon.

Is that a proper dinner party, to eat that way? It is when the company’s good and you can have ice-cream sandwiches for dessert. There won’t be coasters for the cocktails, and you’ll need to hold on to your fork between courses — if indeed there are courses. Coats will be piled on a bed or draped over a banister in the hall. You may need to sit on a stool or a box. But there will always be candles set out and hot dogs in the back of the fridge if someone’s kid doesn’t like the mushrooms in the lasagna or the oxtails in the stew. A dinner party to me is just dinner, served to a crowd that can ebb or flood depending on the season or the weather, on whether a call went out or a work schedule changed.

This sort of entertaining requires flexibility in planning. When all are welcome, people bring other people. So you will want to ask your guests to bring beverages and flowers and other markers of good cheer. Asking helps underscore the message of the night: We’re all in this together. (I always ask for dessert.) To that end as well, don’t cook food that’s portioned as single servings — go with things that can easily be spread across more portions than you’d planned, in case someone brings a new girlfriend, some kid’s friends, somebody’s mom or dad. I like tacos for that, huge salads, lots of potatoes.

Table Talk To ensure a guest’s story becomes truly interesting, just ask two questions over and over: what and why. What exactly happened? What did that feel like? Seek emotional specifics. And then: Why? Why is this anecdote important? This is where the guest’s most thoughtful connection to a story lies.

For much the same reason, a dinner party of the sort I enjoy demands a casual approach to setting the table and to setting a time when you’re actually going to eat. You want to edge into the evenings slowly, engaging in a kind of hospitality that encourages repose rather than nervousness that you’re not going to know which fork to use when you eventually sit down. That takes a kind of confidence, the sort you gain only by practice. It requires that you act as a host. Make sure there is music playing, though not so loudly that you can’t hear people talk. Then, as people arrive, make sure they get a glass of wine or a beer or a rather larger cocktail than they’d make for themselves. Introduce the outgoing ones to people they don’t know; lead the shy to their friends or put them to work in the kitchen, peeling vegetables or stirring a pot. And soon enough it happens, right in front of you: Conversation burbles, runs to fishing and novels, to politics and farming, nearly always to real estate, always to laughs. I watch the energy build. It always builds.

And then, when there’s a good, convivial buzz in the air, I call everyone to attention and serve shellfish in the kitchen or out in the yard, steamed clams or shucked oysters or peel-your-own shrimp, meant to be consumed standing up, as if we were animals at a trough, though the sort of animals who drink prosecco with their feed. I do that because it’s delicious and different (we’re not sitting down?) and special, but also because I believe it acts as a kind of dinner bell in the universe, a dog whistle heard by only my knucklehead friends who said they’d be coming at 6 but then got caught up in replacing a water filter on the boat until well after 7.

Dinner at last! The candles are flickering, and everyone’s ready to eat, and you may find yourself nervous that you haven’t made enough food, particularly because you’ve seen the damage that the big fellow who came with Jim’s sister put on the clams. Never worry. Put everything out as a buffet, or arrange platters family-style at the table, and let your guests have at the feast. The modern parable of the loaves and fishes does not require a miracle, merely adherence to a social contract that makes everyone responsible for ensuring there’s enough food for all. I have served these meals for more than 20 years. There is almost always enough food for all. Indeed, and particularly for those just starting out, there are usually leftovers. The best dinner parties offer memories that last a long time, and a few extra meals besides.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Pere Soler, the ousted director general of the Catalan police force and Major Trapero’s boss, sent a letter to his officers, expressing regret over his removal and thanking them for their work.

Major Trapero, who is facing possible sedition charges after he was accused of failing to stop protesters last month from encircling national police officers, also wrote to his colleagues. He reminded them that their task was to “guarantee the safety of everybody” in the coming days, should the political crisis spur more unrest.

Many protesters said that Madrid had to enforce its decision to invoke Article 155. Some said that, if necessary, the army should be sent in, though most said it would not come to that.

“They need to apply the law,” said Chema Martinez, 22, who described himself as a patriot and a Catholic and wore a Spanish flag with the Sacred Heart of Jesus stamped on its center.

“The army is there to defend Spain,” he said. “They should send in the army to Catalonia; that’s what needs to be done.”

At one point, the Spanish national anthem began to play, and many who had been quietly listening as they sat on the curb silently stood up.

Agueda Rivera, 77, tears streaming down her face, said: “I’m crying. I’m crying for my Spain.”

On Friday, Mr. Rajoy announced that new Catalan elections would be held on Dec. 21, the earliest possible date, in an apparent bid to show frustrated Catalans that Madrid wanted to avoid prolonging a constitutional crisis.

By limiting Madrid’s control over Catalonia to 55 days, analysts said, Mr. Rajoy and his allies were hoping to quickly turn the tables on the separatists, who staged an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by Spain’s government and courts.

“It’s Rajoy’s attempt to regain the democratic initiative, but also a surprisingly risky bet that he can really beat the independence movement,” said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher.

“Whether it works will depend on the level of resistance to Madrid in the coming weeks, which perhaps won’t be that high given that people are exhausted and need a break.”

Albert Rivera, the national leader of Ciudadanos, the party that has been Mr. Rajoy’s main ally in fighting secessionism, told a party conference on Saturday morning, “We will now come out to beat them, but by voting.”

The December elections, he said, were an opportunity for “all the Catalans who have been silenced by nationalism,” after opponents of independence mostly boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum.

“We will now claim the right to vote in freedom,” Mr. Rivera added, “to show the world that this is a free and democratic country.”

Vicent Sanchis, the general manager of the Catalan public television station, TV3, said that it remained to be seen how much practical control Mr. Rajoy could exert over Catalan institutions.

“We live in an uncertain moment,” Mr. Sanchis said in his office. “We now have two parallel legitimacies and we still don’t know which one controls the Catalan institutions.”

“The key thing now is to discover what pressure the Madrid government will now exert,” he added. “In the coming days, we’ll find out.”

Jordi Borda, the deputy director of Catalunya Radio, said a crucial test would come on Monday.

“If the Catalan ministers go to work on Monday and manage to work normally, it will be a strong step towards consolidating what the Catalan Parliament voted on yesterday,” Mr. Borda said.

“If Monday is a normal day,” he said, “it will be a victory for the independence movement.”

Spain’s attorney general is expected to take legal action against Mr. Puigdemont and other leading separatists on Monday, possibly on grounds of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of as long as 30 years.

Joan Queralt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Barcelona, said he expected the attorney general to act forcefully.

“One thing is what the law says and another is how far the government can act,” Professor Queralt said. “I’ve got the feeling that the attorney general will do whatever he wants, just as happens when governments deal with terrorists.”",Catalonia’s Ousted Leader Calls for Peaceful Defiance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/europe/spain-catalonia-independence.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours. When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter. Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that “a store should be a social center.” To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.

During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space — and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.","Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/lord-taylor-wework-and-the-death-of-leisure.html

2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horror’s rise at the box office over the decades. This year, led by “It” and “Get Out,” really has outpaced all others. Image Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) in ""It,"" which has been a smash success at the box office. Credit Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros.

This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves. Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror. Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo . The runaway success of “ It ” (more than $300 million and counting) and “ Get Out ” ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally. “Happy Death Day” was No. 1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit “Saw” franchise, “Jigsaw” (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.

How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades? Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genre’s rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade. Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie. He tried to bring some clarity with a new list. “When ‘It’ came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo,” he wrote in an email. “That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.”

We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror. Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn “The Exorcist” into a $983 million earner).

The 1970s

Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million

In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of “The Exorcist” in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade. (This figure includes box office receipts from the film’s later rereleases. We went with lifetime grosses in this analysis for consistency’s sake.) That movie aside, horror didn’t make much of an impression that year. And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal. The popularity of “Halloween” in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force. And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of “The Amityville Horror” ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of “Alien” ($80.9 million). That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.

The 1980s

Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million

The slasher genre came into its own in the ’80s, with the introduction of Jason in “Friday the 13th” (1980) and Freddy in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for “Friday” and $370.5 million for “Elm Street”). 1987 was one of the decade’s most profitable. “Elm Street” was in its third installment ($44 million), “The Lost Boys” added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of “Predator” (a movie that probably wouldn’t have existed without the success of “Alien”) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).

The 1990s

Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million

The early part of the ’90s saw few major horror blockbusters. Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late ’80s as the reason for the dip. In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video. “A B-side horror film like ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’ might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late ’80s or early ’90s,” he said. “It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.” Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the “Scream” franchise ($331.7 million). And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via “The Blair Witch Project,” a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.

The Aughts

Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million

The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of “Scream” popularity. While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody “Scary Movie” pulled in $157 million. (It ranked No. 9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama “What Lies Beneath” at No. 10.) Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the “Saw” films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far. And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend. 2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of “Friday the 13th,” a sequel to a reboot of “Halloween” and the sixth entry in the “Saw” series. But the jaw-dropper that year was“Paranormal Activity.” A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.

The 2010s

2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (“Get Out,” “Split,” “Happy Death Day”). But the biggest story is the tremendous run of “It.” That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform. Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend. The real number was $123 million. He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title. “When it came to ‘It,’” Mr. Loria said, “it was just really difficult to track the word ‘It’ across social media to get the snapshot we needed.”

After Secretary of State Dean Rusk learned from the Canadians, on New Year’s Day 1967, that a “disturbing” Polish-inspired account of Marigold was circulating, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized a round of quiet counterleaks to the pope, Thant, the Canadians and the British. Word of the failed peace bid spread to chancelleries around the globe — and, inevitably, also seeped out to reporters.

Robert H. Estabrook, the Washington Post’s United Nations correspondent, broke the story in early February, making banner front-page headlines. The insinuation that Washington had squandered an authentic peace chance infuriated American officials; the United Nations ambassador Arthur Goldberg fingered the “tendentious” Poles for the leak. (Decades later, Estabrook revealed that his source was actually a Danish diplomat, supplemented, his notes show, by Thant and Canadian and Yugoslav sources.)

In response, the Johnson administration, led by Rusk and the national security adviser, Walt Rostow, plotted to leak a more sympathetic story, and found an ideal conduit: John M. Hightower, the veteran national security specialist at The Associated Press. Hightower even received guidance from administration officials, notably Rusk himself, in meetings and phone calls to “tidy up” his draft: “Sec. told H. to write the story that takes into account some of the things Sec. has said privately and then Sec. will go over certain points with H.”

Hightower’s article, reflecting the American view that the Communists, not Washington, had destroyed any peace prospects, was featured by The New York Times (which never published its own inquiry) atop its front page on May 9; it quoted unnamed “high officials” as being “skeptical that Warsaw ever had a firm commitment or Hanoi a serious intention to open secret talks.” A State Department spokesman quickly endorsed the story’s accuracy.

In other words, the first account of the Polish peace affair, with an anti-administration spin, appeared in The Washington Post, whose editorial page strongly supported the war (and basically told readers to ignore the scoop on the front page), while The New York Times, editorially a trenchant antiwar critic, trumpeted a report with a strong pro-Administration tilt, shaped backstage by Rusk.

The administration’s victory proved pyrrhic, however. The exculpatory A.P. article aroused the suspicions of the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau chief, David Kraslow, whose paper remained staunchly Republican but was keen to enhance its journalistic stature. Sensing an important tale behind the classified veil, Kraslow and the bureau’s White House reporter, Stuart H. Loory, took a leave from their usual duties to chase a blockbuster exposé.

Over the summer they made scant progress quizzing reticent officials, yet were tantalized by a conversation with one figure they would describe only as a “close associate of the President” but whom notes identify as Bill Moyers, code-named “Source M.”

Johnson’s former press secretary, who had left the White House just as the secret peace gambit withered, said the reporters would “never get the inside story” of “Marigold” — the first time they heard the still-secret code-name — because none of the 10 or so officials who knew the truth would talk to them.

Why not?

“Because it makes our government look so bad,” Mr. Moyers said.

The reporters sensed progress in October, when, on a tip from Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who had soured on the war — Kraslow visited Cambridge, Mass., to interview Henry A. Kissinger. The Harvard historian, a State Department consultant, was rumored (correctly) to be involved in a secret scheme to communicate with Hanoi via “French channels,” but he deftly deflected the reporter’s grilling. Exasperated, Kraslow threw a Hail Mary.

“We were chatting and chatting, and he was being very coy and very tight-lipped,” Kraslow remembered. “I said, ‘Henry, what do you know about Marigold?’ He turned beet-red and said, ‘How do you know about Marigold?’ And that told me everything I needed to know.”

Convinced they had a story, even a book, the reporters intensified their interviewing. They found sources — some of whom sent memos to higher-ups insisting they had intoned only the official line — who, notes indicate, actually spoke more candidly, admitting that failures to coordinate military and diplomatic tracks may have derailed multiple peace overtures.

Some top officials reacted angrily. McNamara told the reporters that anyone who spoke to them about “the most delicate subject confronting the United States government today,” other than the president or secretary of state (both refused interview requests), “should have his head cut off.” Rostow yelled that The Los Angeles Times’ probe was “as bad as giving away war secrets.” After Kraslow and Loory had fanned out to Western and Communist Eastern Europe to interview sources, the national security adviser scoffed: “Everybody and his brother knows what you’re doing. You remind me of Laurel and Hardy trying to play sleuths.”

At a late November meeting at the White House, Johnson and his aides plotted to undermine the duo. The president suggested that Rusk’s top Vietnam aide, William P. Bundy, disclose titillating tidbits on a Sunday TV talk show, while McNamara, afraid “the Canadians, the Italians and the Poles have ‘spilled their guts’” to them, proposed to “torpedo” their impending reports by leaking a more favorable version, including the “Marigold” code name, to a friendly reporter, The Washington Post’s Chalmers M. Roberts.

But again, the administration leak boomeranged. Warsaw’s ambassador in Washington, who had already spread a Polish version of Marigold, correctly inferred that Roberts’s article was intended “to take away the wind from the sails of the California journalists” and urged retaliation. In this situation, he cabled Rapacki, “we especially need to leak out information to them.” From Lewandowski in Warsaw, and D’Orlandi in Rome, Loory confirmed that both Communist Poland and the NATO member Italy had urged Washington against the Hanoi attacks that had spoiled the initiative.

In early 1968, as Kraslow and Loory wrapped up their interviews and began writing, the administration made one last thrust to steal their thunder: Bundy fed inside dope to enliven a Life magazine cover story (“Behind the Peace Feelers”), trotting out a ringer — a Hungarian diplomat who had defected the previous May but remained reclusive ever since — to back the argument that East European Vietnam diplomacy was fraudulent.

By the time the reporters published their findings, in the spring — first in a Los Angeles Times series, then a book, “The Secret Search for Peace in Vietnam” — Johnson had already dropped out of the presidential race. Historians still dispute whether Johnson missed any real opportunities for peace. But the drip-drip-drip of leaks that he had done so, both foreign and domestic, had already widened his “credibility gap,” generating charges that his peace efforts were insincere, incompetent, or both, and leaving him vulnerable to an insurgency from within his own party.",The War of Leaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/the-war-of-leaks-vietnam.html

Researchers found that the less knowledge consumers had about something before a purchase, the better they expected it to be — and the more they convinced themselves that they liked it afterward.

This reduction of cognitive dissonance is easier inside and after leaving a store, which never reveals anything negative about its products and doesn’t typically burden the consumer with an onslaught of information that might impede an impulse purchase. But the sprawling internet bazaar is filled with scathing critiques, and every pertinent spec exists somewhere online for the diligent buyer to seek out. That one-star rating is hard to forget when your product is failing in the exact way the unhappy reviewer described.

The most obvious difference between brick-and-mortar and online shopping is physicality, both of the item itself and the consumer’s presence in the store. Beyond the potential pitfall of not getting exactly what you thought you were buying online, a problem that is minimized when you can assess the product in person, the lack of tactile interaction may reduce our connection to the object.

Martin Lindstrom, the author of several books on branding, has conducted studies on what makes consumers buy a product and how they feel about it after. In one, 34 percent of people who asked an employee for a product in a supermarket and were made to touch it ended up buying it; just 21 percent did if the employee merely pointed it out to them.

In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20 subjects, when the senses of smell and touch were paired with pictures of a product, the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in the perception of pleasantness, was activated more strongly than when those senses were independently engaged. (On its own, smell was the most important sense.)

The tactile experience doesn’t end in the checkout line. After purchasing an item, the consumer typically takes it home. This act of carrying it into one’s domestic space can bolster one’s proprietary pride: You are now responsible for its existence in your world. That act, plus roaming through aisles beforehand and going from shop to shop, can also be physically and mentally tiring.

But ordering online for an anonymous deliveryman to leave the item at one’s doorstep — or, with the help of Amazon Key, just inside — is impersonal and not enervating. It’s the difference between the estrangement of ordering takeout and the intimacy of cooking for oneself. And a pavement-pounding, shop-till-you-drop marathon may recall an even more primal method for acquiring nutrients.

“You’re coming back to hunters and gatherers,” Mr. Lindstrom said of in-store purchases. “Dopamine kicks in when we’re buying stuff — there’s a reptile brain that tells us we need to gather things before winter happens. The more we have to fight for things, the less likely we are to return it after. When it’s delivered on Amazon Prime, you forget it was so hard to get this product.”

The tactility of how one finalizes the transaction itself can have an effect on remorse, too. Mr. Lindstrom found that 93 percent of consumers feel a stronger connection to cash than to credit cards and are more careful when spending with it. Likewise, for the least tactile connection he studied, Amazon’s 1-Click Ordering, 70 percent of respondents said it made them spend more money than even with a credit card.

But whereas cash-based transactions lead to more immediate remorse, 89 percent of shoppers said they feel guiltier when they receive their credit card statements after 1-Click orders than when they pay in cash. The remorse still exists with online shopping; it’s just deferred, with extra pain later.

Shopping on a website featuring attractive models or beautiful homes may engender the same sense of inadequacy that leafing through catalogs can, unlike picking them up in person, and that visual memory may linger when the object has been delivered, leading to remorse. Buying something online can also lead quickly to a social-media search after the fact for friends’ and strangers’ superior products (or “better” use of the same product).

The sneakers I bought in this troublesomely bottomless marketplace were for casual wear, but I also needed a new pair of running shoes, a purchase that I undertook with more serious online research: reading reviews from specialized publications and individual users, comparing models from different years, taking quizzes to determine what was best for my particular stride.

But even the highest-rated sneakers had their detractors, and those damning, all-caps review headlines (“SHODDILY MADE,” “THEY RUINED IT”) made me hesitate whenever I was on the verge of adding them to my virtual shopping cart.

A week after searching in vain and the ensuing deluge of targeted ads, I visited a nearby running store. I tried on a few pairs and solicited opinions from one employee, then picked the sneakers that felt best.

Within 20 minutes I was walking out with them, glad to have given my money to a local business over a soulless national chain. There is undoubtedly a better running shoe out there for me, and I could probably find it if I spent enough time scouring the internet. But je ne regrette rien.",Amazon Key Is a Lot Less Scary Than My Post-1-Click Remorse,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/amazon-key-1-click-buyers-remorse.html

5 Bargain Destinations for Fall Travel

Fall isn’t just about pretty leaves for travelers. Those willing to venture overseas could end up with some major savings, according to Hipmunk, the website and app that studies itineraries and other data to reveal affordable travel deals.

Hipmunk recently looked at a year’s worth of flight bookings to determine some of the best off-season bargain destinations for the fall season. It analyzed roundtrip flights departing from the United States to international cities between Oct 1. of last year through Sept. 30 of this year. The savings percentage is based on maximum monthly pricing for that destination.

Here are selections from our coverage of some of those recommendations, including the percentage of savings for that destination.

Brussels, Belgium

Average November Fare: $824 (-63 percent)

“There is literally nothing to do here,” the British musician Noel Gallagher once said of Brussels, that hotbed of policy directives. Clearly he didn’t have a chance to admire the graffiti, avant-garde installations or conceptual creations in the city’s new art spaces. Or shop for vintage items in the many retro and antique boutiques. Or taste the innovative dishes in the city’s neo-Belgian and Belgian-fusion restaurants.

Cape Town, South Africa

Average November Fare: $1,875 (-55 percent)

Heralded as one of the world’s most beautiful cities — few destinations can mimic the scale of its mountain-ocean convergence — Cape Town doesn’t need to be as accommodating as it is; it could, in theory, sit pretty on the merits of its natural bounties alone. And yet it remains a singularly inviting place.

Berlin

Average November Fare: $991 (-42 percent)

There are few cities in the world that transform themselves as profoundly from season to season as Berlin. It remains a place for the strange and libertine, where the radical left still nips at the heels of neoliberalism, where snapping photos in public is often more taboo than smoking a joint, and where people seldom ask what it is you “do.”

Hong Kong

Average November Fare: $752 (-42 percent)

As impressive as Hong Kong’s skyline is, the city never seems to stop building. With all this attention on infrastructure, though, Hong Kong hasn’t sacrificed its soul. It remains one of Asia’s most passionately creative cities, a playground for artists and designers, chefs and entrepreneurs.

Tokyo

Average November Fare: $1,050 (-21 percent)

Contemplating the physical sprawl of Tokyo is dizzying. The Japanese megalopolis has no discernible center, and clusters of skyscrapers miles apart defy the idea of a downtown core. But when time is limited, don’t be distracted by the hypnotic, multistory video screens. Instead, focus on a diverse cross-section of neighborhoods, from peaceful Nakameguro to eclectic Koenji, for a taste of this capital that will leave you hungry for more.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at New York’s Leica Gallery. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

A woman stands inside a subway car, her face bisected by a pole. Commuters at Grand Central are rendered as dreamlike silhouettes. Cars, pedestrians and buildings come at you at crazy angles. A man stepping into a Checker cab pauses to look at a dog, which stares back.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

Newspaper articles detailed the killing effects of Soviet nuclear weapons. Children learned to “duck and cover” in schools. Homeowners built shelters in basements and backyards, and the morality of private shelters accessible to privileged families became a raging national debate.

Photo

On television, “The Twilight Zone” depicted friends and neighbors in fear of an imminent nuclear attack fighting over access to one family’s shelter. A Life magazine cover featured the alarming image of a man in a “civilian fallout suit” and the headline “How You Can Survive Fallout: 97 of 100 People Can Be Saved.” The government issued a 46-page pamphlet, “Fallout Protection: What to Know and Do About Nuclear Attack.”

President John F. Kennedy’s public fallout shelter program was intended to ease the nation’s anxieties, but its very announcement terrified many Americans. “We have another sober responsibility,” the president told the nation on July 25, 1961, “to recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age, without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if the bombs begin to fall.”

Photo

The program began with a nationwide survey by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify shelter sites. But signs for the public to find the sites apparently occurred to no one at the White House, the Pentagon or the Corps of Engineers. Almost as an afterthought, Maj. Gen. Keith R. Barney, the deputy chief of engineers, posed the matter to Mr. Blakeley, the director of administrative logistics support function.

In plainer language, Mr. Blakeley was one of those important but anonymous civil servants down the chain of command where the buck really stops. He had been a civilian manager for the corps for five years, in charge of administrative work for some 60 harbor, river and other military construction projects.

And in a lifetime of memorable experiences — he was a combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War, and would eventually meet Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter in the course of his duties and become president of Toastmasters International — the shelter signs seemed, as he put it, “no big deal.”

“Like so many other things in life, you solve a problem and go on to the next thing,” he said in a telephone interview for this obituary from his home in Jacksonville in 2014. “I must have just wiped it out of my mind.”

Robert Wilson Blakeley was born in Ogden, Utah, on Aug. 30, 1922, one of four children of Robert G. and Elsie Jean Wilson Blakeley. He attended public schools and Weber Junior College (now Weber State University) in Ogden, and studied for a year at Utah State University.

He joined the Marine Corps in 1943 and was a sergeant major in the Fourth Marine Division invasion of Iwo Jima in 1945, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. He was recalled to duty in the Korean War in 1951 and 1952.

His first marriage, to Jean Brown in the 1940s, ended in divorce. In 1952 he married Dorothy McArthur. She died in 1992. Besides their daughter, Dorothy, they had a son, Robert, who died at age 36. In 2003, he married Irene Allan Davis. In addition to her and his daughter, Mr. Blakeley is survived by three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Mr. Blakeley studied landscape architecture at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1954. After two years with the Veterans Administration, he joined the Army Corps of Engineers in 1956. To improve his speaking, he joined Toastmasters in 1958. He became its international president for 1976-77.

Given responsibility for the fallout shelter project, he decided that for durability, the signs would be made of metal, and that the colors and design would be simple and eye-catching, even in the dark chaos of a city under attack.

“It would have to be usable in downtown New York City, Manhattan, when all the lights are out and people are on the street and don’t know where to go,” Mr. Blakeley told Bill Geerhart, a blogger on Cold War topics, for an oral history that appeared on the website Conelrad Adjacent in 2006. The sign, he said, “had to be something that would get people’s attention and give them direction to the location.”

After experimenting with reflective paint in the basement of his Virginia home, he chose orange-yellow and black for the primary colors, and drew the sign as his children watched over his shoulder. The graphic design was suggested by Blair Inc., of Fairfax, Va., and was probably inspired by “Hornung’s Handbook of Designs and Devices,” published in 1932 and updated in 1946.

What he came up with entailed three bright, inverted equilateral triangles joined at the center on a round black background, with shelter capacity circled near the base, followed by the words “Fallout Shelter” in large block capitals and directional arrows .

The details were approved by Powell Pierpoint, special assistant to the secretary of the Army. Mr. Blakeley recommended that the Army accept bids by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, for 400,000 large exterior signs, and Alfray Products of Coshocton, Ohio, for a million smaller interior signs. The total cost was $700,000.

They were put into production, and Mr. Blakeley unveiled the first prototype (capacity 1,730) at the Westchester County Office Building in White Plains on Oct. 4, 1961. Over decades, the signs proliferated as commercial and apartment buildings joined government sites as shelters — 230,000 sites in New York City alone, civil defense officials estimated.

And as the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam War and the buildup of nuclear arsenals raised the stakes, the Blakeley signs became counterculture icons of the Cold War, mock symbols of apocalypse bobbing in antiwar protests, featured in films and television dramas and plastered on campaign buttons, refrigerator magnets and album covers, like Bob Dylan’s 1965 classic “Bringing It All Back Home.”

But as the Cold War passed without nuclear calamity, federal funding and interest in the shelters faded, their signs rusted and, in 1980, Mr. Blakeley retired from government service, his omens of Armageddon all but forgotten or, where they still remained on buildings, ignored.

When his children were young, he told Mr. Geerhart, “We’d go down the street, and one of the kids would say, ‘Hey, Dad, there’s one of your signs.’ But, you know, other than that it’s just like many of the other things that happen in life. It’s just one of those routine things.”","Robert Blakeley, Whose Fallout Shelter Sign Symbolized the Cold War, Dies at 95",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/robert-blakeley-whose-fallout-shelter-sign-symbolized-the-cold-war-dies-at-95.html

Mike Noble, a Republican pollster, called it “bedlam out here in Arizona.”

“Everyone’s phones are blowing up,” he said. “This is essentially a free-for-all.”

For Democrats to narrow the Republican hold on the Senate, they will have to take aim at two Republican seats, Mr. Flake’s and Senator Dean Heller’s in Nevada. No other Republican up for re-election next year comes from a generally competitive state.

But while they have talked a big game in Arizona, hoping for a demographic and political shift, so far, Democrats have little to show for their efforts. The party does not hold a single statewide office. In 2012, the last time the state had an open Senate seat, Democrats recruited Richard H. Carmona, a tough-talking Vietnam War hero and former surgeon general in the administration of George W. Bush. Despite Mr. Carmona’s conservative credentials, Mr. Flake won the seat, 49 percent to 46 percent.

Next year could be different. The challenge for Republican Party officials will be to find a candidate who is aligned closely enough with Mr. Trump to appeal to his populist wing of the party — and to beat Ms. Ward in a primary dominated by the hard right — but not so closely that he or she would lose to Ms. Sinema.

The party needs “an acceptable ‘not Kelli’ choice who can surf the policy divides that are besieging our party right now,” said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in Arizona. He and other strategists say they have been inundated with text messages and phone calls since Mr. Flake’s surprise decision to leave the race.

Mr. Flake, who lost support with Trump supporters in Arizona after publishing a book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” that took aim at the president, announced his retirement this past week with a blistering indictment of Mr. Trump and the Republicans who embrace him.

But while he framed his decision as a matter of principle, polling in the state showed just how difficult it would be for an anti-Trump Republican to win an Arizona primary. One recent poll showed Mr. Flake with an 18 percent approval rating, and a survey in August by Arizona High Ground, Mr. Coughlin’s firm, found Mr. Flake trailing both Ms. Ward and Ms. Sinema.

Ms. Ward has the backing of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, who has vowed to wage war on establishment Republicans, chief among them Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Ed Rollins, a veteran strategist who is the co-chairman of Great America, a Trump-aligned political action committee, recently signed on as her campaign manager.

And Robert Mercer, the deep-pocketed New York investor who helped finance Mr. Trump’s campaign, has donated $300,000 to Ms. Ward’s political action committee this year, according to Federal Election Commission records.

But Steven Law, the chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee aligned with Mr. McConnell, vowed that Mr. Bannon and his allies would be the losers.

“Senator Flake’s decision to exit the race gives everyone a chance — the White House and Republicans in Arizona — to work together to find a strong candidate who can hold this seat,” Mr. Law said in an email. “That’s not going to be Kelli Ward.”

Arizona House Republicans met privately in Washington on Thursday morning to discuss who might challenge Ms. Ward. At least one potential candidate, Representative David Schweikert, told reporters last week that he lacked “the burning passion” to run. No consensus was reached on an alternative.

Speculation has centered on State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, an early and enthusiastic Trump backer who was the chief operating officer of the president’s 2016 campaign, and Representative Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and the first American woman to fly in combat.

Photo

But it is unclear whether Mr. DeWit is interested. And with Mr. McCain battling brain cancer, party operatives say Ms. McSally — who has long expressed a desire to serve in the Senate — may be betting that his seat will open up, and that she could ascend to the Senate by appointment of the governor.

Ms. McSally has also drawn opposition from a coalition of conservative advocacy groups, led by the Club for Growth. On Friday, the Club for Growth released a letter urging Matt Salmon, a former representative from Arizona, to jump into the race, calling Mr. Salmon “a proven, principled conservative.” Mr. Salmon, who is now the chief lobbyist for Arizona State University, is considering it, a person close to him said.

Whoever wins the Republican primary will almost certainly face Ms. Sinema, who is pitching herself to voters as a consensus builder with a compelling life story: She was homeless as a child, and her family lived for a time in an abandoned gas station.

In a brief interview while taking a break from fund-raising phone calls, the congresswoman described herself as “really committed to finding a bipartisan solution” to the nation’s problems, and said she subscribed to both liberal and conservative values — a philosophy she said had roots in her childhood.

“We got help from both family and my parents’ church, but we also got help from the government,” she said, adding that she believed in “the conservative concept of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and working really hard every day,” and in the liberal notion that “you’ve got to help people in need.”

Ms. Sinema, 41, is also the first openly bisexual member of the House, and has the strong backing of gay rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the powerful Washington advocacy organization, which has vowed to make “significant investments” in Arizona races this year.

But some of her positions have rankled party progressives. Besides her Benghazi vote, she also voted against Representative Nancy Pelosi of California for Democratic leader.

There is “still a lot of resentment” toward Ms. Sinema over her Benghazi vote, said Mr. Grijalva, who added that he would withhold his endorsement until he learned more about how she would vote on issues including tax cuts, immigration and the environment.

“Given how Kyrsten Sinema defines herself in the next few months, she could solidify her position with a real chance to win,” Mr. Grijalva said.

One potential challenger to Ms. Sinema is Mark Kelly, the retired astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly wounded in a 2011 massacre in Tucson. This past spring, some grass-roots Democratic groups in Arizona drafted a petition encouraging Mr. Kelly, who now advocates gun safety, to enter the race, and they are said to be renewing that effort.",‘Bedlam Out Here in Arizona’ After Jeff Flake Departs Senate Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/politics/arizona-senate-race-flake-sinema-ward-bannon.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The number who die each year from...

The opioid epidemic has not fallen equally on all races or regions. Like an infectious disease, drug overdoses have emerged in clusters around the country.

Among those 15 to 44 — the age group in which drug overdose accounts for the greatest share of deaths — there are vast differences across racial categories and between urban and rural places. Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.

The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.

“It just blew through all the measures we’d been taking,” said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn’t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there’s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug’s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.

The illicit fentanyls being added to the heroin supply also vary widely in purity and quality. This unpredictability kills: Users often don’t realize the strength of what they’re taking until it’s too late.

An evolving epidemic

The country's struggles with opioids go back centuries, but the current epidemic has roots in the 1980s, when a few studies made doctors less wary of prescribing opioids for pain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers began aggressively marketing them for many ailments, particularly after OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid, hit the market in 1996. Soon, narcotics that had been reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care found their way into medicine cabinets across the country.

Michael Botticelli, the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and former White House drug czar, said that rampant over-prescription of painkillers had actually been decreasing in the last few years. “We’d turned a corner on that,” Mr. Botticelli said, “but we’ve seen the continued escalation of overdose deaths in many states.”

Some experts argue that the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, undertaken when addiction treatment was insufficient, pushed people toward heroin and inadvertently drove up the rate of overdose deaths. Mr. Botticelli said that theory isn’t supported by the data.

Regardless of the cause, there is little disagreement that heroin addiction has evolved into a full-fledged crisis of its own. “Young people are flocking to heroin,” Dr. Ciccarone said. Halting prescription opioid abuse will probably not be enough to stop the growing number of deaths.

What can be done

The Trump administration has established a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study responses to the epidemic. The commission’s final report is expected in November.

Among public health researchers, there is broad agreement about what's needed: access to addiction treatment and medications; tighter regulation of prescription opioids; widespread distribution of naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote; needle exchanges or supervised injection centers; and law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, the bulk of which is thought to come from China and Mexico.

“This is not a hopeless situation,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., describing interdiction as a critical piece of the strategy. “If law enforcement can substantially interfere with the supply of illicit opioids, it will save a lot of lives.”

He and other experts expressed hope for new partnerships between law enforcement and public health. Cooperation would, for example, allow public health workers to pinpoint groups of drug users who may be amenable to treatment or identify particularly deadly batches of drugs before they kill.",You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html

But it’s hardly universal, partly because there is and always has been disagreement about the very mission of higher education. Should it grapple with the world as it is or point the way to the world as it should be?

Even before Trump’s election, there was welling discussion about the ideological uniformity of many colleges, where the left holds bold and sometimes imperious sway.

In 2013 the University of Colorado, Boulder, welcomed its first “visiting scholar in conservative thought,” a teaching position created to bring someone from the right to the school each year. In 2015 Jonathan Haidt, a justly celebrated social psychologist at New York University, helped to found the Heterodox Academy, an organization that promotes intellectual diversity in higher education.

And a growing number of educators have been wondering aloud if there should be “affirmative action” for conservative professors, given the hugely disproportionate percentage of liberal faculty in the humanities and social sciences. They often conclude that outright preferences are a bad idea but that creating an extra position in, say, military history rather than gender studies would probably up the odds of adding a Republican to the lineup.

Trump’s election at once imperiled and emboldened this movement. To some college administrators and instructors, it was proof that the barbarians were at the gate and that students needed safe spaces more than ever. Understanding what happened on Nov. 8 was less important than fighting furiously against it.

“The idea that the only people who voted for Trump have missing front teeth is really so extraordinary, and yet I think that’s largely what people in the academy think,” said Jean Yarbrough, a conservative professor of political science at Bowdoin College who voted for him herself. These faculty members, she added, consider 2016 “an illegitimate election, so they’re not worried about their being out of touch with America.”

But others are rightly concerned, and that includes parents. Inside Higher Ed published an article recently in which college-placement advisers said that some clients wanted to steer clear of certain elite schools — Yale and Brown were singled out — that struck them as overzealously progressive.

Lynn Morton, the president of Warren Wilson College, publicly expressed dissatisfaction with its reputation as a bohemian enclave and made an explicit appeal for conservative students.

Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that “to create deeper intellectual and political diversity, we need an affirmative-action program for the full range of conservative ideas and traditions, because on too many of our campuses they seldom get the sustained, scholarly attention that they deserve.” He said that in addition to Wesleyan’s commitment to admitting at least 10 military veterans to every freshman class, it would welcome senior military officials as instructors and would tweak its curriculum to offer, for example, a course on the philosophical underpinnings of free enterprise.

For educators open to such changes, the election was both an illustration and a consequence of how polarized our country had become and how poorly Americans in separate cultural and ideological camps communicated with one another. And they aren’t content simply to put “Hillbilly Elegy” on the summer reading list for incoming students (which many colleges have done).

Hence the Inside Higher Ed survey’s discovery of a heightened interest in applicants whose demographic and geographic profiles dovetail with those of Trump voters. If colleges are serious about the educational benefits of diversity, the thinking goes, they need to factor in those students, and they can’t promote respectful, elevated debate if the campus is one big blissful love-in of like-minded liberals. Affluent teenagers from Brooklyn Heights, Brookline and Bethesda need to hear from evangelicals, from young men and women who did tours of duty in Afghanistan, from those whose relatives thrilled to Trump.

Bowdoin’s Yarbrough stressed that college is when you have the energy for “staying up through the night to argue with people in your dorm.” But to do that, those dorm mates must have different opinions and an invitation to express them. Most colleges like hers aren’t creating that atmosphere, she said, adding, “I think it’s a dereliction of duty.”

I see scattered signs that colleges are owning up to that. Johns Hopkins University recently announced an initiative, backed by a $150 million gift, to “address the deterioration of civic engagement” and promote “inclusive discourse.” The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is nurturing a new Institute of Politics with similar goals.

Public schools like U.N.C. have an additional incentive to accommodate a full range of viewpoints. “If colleges are seen as disconnected,” Jaschik noted, “why would Joe Taxpayer in Raleigh care about what happens in Chapel Hill?” Indeed, some state universities have already felt the sting of conservative lawmakers’ disapproval, and a Pew Research Center poll in June showed that a significant majority of Republicans and conservative-leaning independents now believe that colleges have a negative impact on America.

I don’t agree, and I’m not suggesting that colleges normalize Trump, validate everyone who backed him or make room for the viciously bigoted sentiments he often stoked. But there’s inquisitive, constructive territory short of that.

And colleges should be places where we learn to persuade people not to take paths that we consider dangerous instead of simply gaping and yelling at them. That requires putting them and their ideas into the mix.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

Extreme Measures

Photo

In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.

The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade. A new cartel, La Familia Michoacána, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence. Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.

That same year, Felipe Calderón won the presidency by a hair. Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Calderón left him without a strong mandate.

Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.

Critics say Mr. Calderón sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.

Defenders say he had little alternative. Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption. When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges. Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.

This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people. But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.

Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems

Photo

Mr. Calderón adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders. This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.

But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.

In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexico’s pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.

And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.

Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016

Reforms, desperately needed to fix outdated practices — 24-hour police shifts, poor evidentiary standards, a rule that forbids most police officers from conducting investigations — drifted.

As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.

Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, “there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.”

Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion. Predatory crimes spiked.

Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.

“In the process of that fragmentation, we didn’t do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces,” said Mr. Valdés, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding. “So we have the worst of the worst.”

‘The Key Point of Failure’

The solution to the problem would seem obvious. Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.

Instead, disorder and violence have risen.

Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the country’s woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.

All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.

During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership. Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.

Democracy, as intended, undercut the party’s once all-encompassing power. But the old system built around the assumption of a strong central authority remains in place.

This has weakened the state while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a “nightmare scenario” in which “the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.”

For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms. And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants — often providing the wrong kind of incentives.

“At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability,” Mr. Hope said. “That is the key point of failure in Mexico.”

“Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work,” he added. “Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement. Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services. Nothing happens.”

A Frail State Recedes

Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.

As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.

“I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out” on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.

“There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary — in the press,” Mr. Lagunes said.

But, he added, “Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.”

The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable. In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded. Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.

The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderón’s drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses. But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.

State and Society Atomize

This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Calderón did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.

Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers. But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.

Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice “relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.”

Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed “self-defense” militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.

Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced. Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.

In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.

Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism “represent a disempowerment of the state.”

Paralysis Amid Disaster

Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous. Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.

“We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there,” said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.

Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan. Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.

When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the country’s “social decomposition.”

Mr. Valdés, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.

“We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police,” he said. “We spent years trying to convince the political class.”

But he found those institutions — dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term — unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.

While virtual-reality pornography may feel like something out of a science fiction movie, it already has a formidable, if underground, presence. According to website Pornhub, views of VR porn are up 275 percent since it debuted in the summer of 2016. Now the site is averaging about 500,000 views (on Christmas Day in 2016, this number shot up to 900,000.)

By 2025 pornography will be the third-largest VR sector, according to estimates prepared by Piper Jaffray, an investment and management firm. Only video games and N.F.L.-related content will be larger, it predicted, and the market will be worth $1 billion.

“We’re getting more and more of it every day,” said Mark Kernes, a senior editor at AVN Media Network, which covers the industry. “We are leading the technology in this area. Sex sells, and where there is money to be made, there will be entrepreneurs who want to adopt it and make money from it,” some by offering it for free to increase clicks.

Pornography is what rushed along the first printing press, and spurred developments in the internet, online payment systems and other technology. Now it’s time for virtual reality, Mr. Kernes said: “I’m pretty sure there is more porn VR out there than regular VR.”

Headsets Are Just the Beginning

Ms. Darling first experienced regular old VR at E3, a conference for the video-game industry. Excited by the pornography possibilities, she found a college student on Reddit who knew the technology but lacked a star. Before long, Ms. Darling started streaming weekly VR segments live from her bedroom in Los Angeles.

She was one of the first VR webcam women, according to Mr. Kernes. She then started a company named VRTube.xxx, which now employs over 40 performers.

Though the pornography industry as a whole is challenging to regulate, considering the potential for abuse, disease and exploitation, the virtual kind comes with extra moral and maybe legal issues. For example, can you use someone’s likeness to have sex with them in virtual reality?

“Virtual reality is like the Wild Wild West,” said Bryony Cole, the host of “Future of Sex,” a podcast that explores technology and sexuality.

At this year’s AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a convention and trade show held each January in Las Vegas, the latest advancements in virtual reality pornography were on display.

CamSoda, a website that specializes in live sex videos, had an exhibit featuring pornography stars dressed in plunging bathing suits and waving visitors into the booth. They were showing off OhRama, a small canister that attaches to virtual reality headsets and releases scent during the action. “Believe it or not, the scents were created by the girls,” said Mr. Kernes, who was there. “It’s sweet and musty. They know what they like.”

There are also companies that are adding taste and touch to the experience.

Another big player is CamasutraVR, a start-up using 142 cameras that all look at one person, or one body part. “They are creating images from that, which they are hoping will be indistinguishable from an actual person,” Mr. Kernes said. “I’m sure those people wished they had been using that VR system at home.”

Still other virtual reality companies were showing off their partnerships with sex toy companies to create vibrators or penis pumps that link to VR material. “As the action ramps up so does the vibrations of the vibrator,” he said.

One of the most buzzed-about inventions has been the sex robot. The first one, Harmony, was introduced in May by a company named Realbotix. In seductive videos posted on YouTube, Harmony shows off her long legs, her firm breasts, her full lips, her lifelike hand gestures, even her intellect.

“How do you feel about sex?” an unknown presenter asks her in one video.

“Sex is one of the most fascinating things in the world,” she responds in a raspy voice. “I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Harmony can connect with virtual reality so the user can interact with her in that space; she can perform all the acts the viewer is watching.

“It’s a little bit of a video game combined with sci-fi,” said Matt McMullen, the C.E.O. and creative director of Realbotix. The company has been making dolls for 20 years that were linked to artificial intelligence but not virtual reality. “Based on our experiences with thousands of clients,” Mr. McMullen said, “people do use them for sex, but there is something more that exists. We focus on companionship.”

Virtual reality has been nicknamed the empathy machine because it allows people to feel like they are truly connected to the action. “It’s neurological,” said Holly Richmond, a somatic psychologist based in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. “You aren’t just watching and thinking about it. You are feeling it, and it’s not just your genitals. There is literally a mind-body connection.”

When Ms. Darling does live X-rated performances, users can leave comments and chat to one another on the side of the screen. “The people who are in virtual reality tell the other people watching me in 2-D to stop being jerks and knock it off,” she said. “They feel like they know me and are in the bedroom with me.”

Many sex therapists and educators are interested in the new technology, just as a dentist might be with the latest plaque-detection gizmos. Ms. Richmond worked with BaDoinkVR, a virtual-reality company in Rochester, N.Y., to create Virtual Sexology, a series of free videos that help men and women overcome common sex problems.

A recent video, updated in June, takes women into the bedroom where they see how one blond, busty woman arouses herself before sex. She sits in front of her partner massaging her arms, her legs, her breasts. As her breathing heats up, a voice-over says that some women need to be physically touched before feeling any desire for sex. The first video, aimed at men, was the most downloaded video on BaDointVR.com in 2016 — an impressive feat considering it was competing with noneducational pornography.

Ms. Cole, the podcast host, is most excited about how virtual reality can be used in sex education.

“What if we had young people watch videos where they practice consent or practice identifying at-risk behaviors?” she said. “Or they can be in a room with someone who said, ‘I contacted herpes and this is my experience.’ That is way more informative than a gonorrhea slide.”

Indeed.

Barbara Rothbaum, a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Emory’s Veterans Program, is studying how virtual reality can help treat people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by military sexual trauma.

The program is building scenes that take victims to barracks, tents, private living quarters, latrines, offices or remote buildings and vehicles, where the trauma may have taken place. The idea is that going back to these places virtually will help victims confront their memories so they can move forward with more internal peace.

But for virtual reality to work, the scenes have to be so lifelike that users get lost in them and take them for reality. They have to feel like they are participants, not just observers. “We can create 3-D bodies in virtual reality and do whatever we want with them,” Ms. Cole said. As the technology becomes good enough to make that happen, issues are bound to arise.

Mr. McCullen said an issue his company has is clients commissioning dolls that look exactly like people they know in real life, maybe an ex-girlfriend they never got over or someone about whom they fantasize. His company requires written consent from the model for his or her likeness to be used.

Ms. Cole said VR companies are going to have to address this same problem as they get better at customizing avatars to look exactly like what their customers desire. “What are the lines between reality and fantasy and what can we do in this space?” she said. “What does consent mean in virtual reality? Can you do something to your girlfriend in virtual reality that you wouldn’t do in real life? If you are using someone’s likeness in virtual reality, do you require their permission? And what about revenge porn? That will be even harsher in virtual reality.”

She is worried about the technology assimilating into the culture as easily as dating apps, drawing people away from flesh-and-blood encounters.

Certainly partners will also have to negotiate whether virtual-reality sex constitutes cheating. It is, after all, much more lifelike than traditional pornography.

But Mr. McCullen said a lot of people accuse his sex robot of doing that, but he believes he is helping alleviate a bad situation, not causing it. “There are people who are already lonely, and people who live their lives being alone. They work all day and come home to an empty house,” he said. “This is just offering an alternative to those types of people. They don’t have anyone else.”",Virtual Reality Gets Naughty,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/style/virtual-reality-porn.html

It was the only matchup in World Series history in which both starters allowed four or fewer base runners.

Yet despite efficient pitch counts — 84 for Wood, 76 for Morton — both starters were gone by the seventh-inning stretch.

“It’s always in your best interest to take the pitcher out a hitter too early rather than a hitter too late, and I’ve always tried to give the reliever a little bit of a leash,” Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. “I always try to give the starter a ‘job well done’ when he walks off the mound. But the context of the game is always going to shift and change.”

Since the Mets’ Matt Harvey faltered in the ninth inning of the final game of 2015, managers have refused to let starters go deep in the World Series. The starters in Game 3 of the Series last fall — the Chicago Cubs’ Kyle Hendricks and the Cleveland Indians’ Josh Tomlin — were both removed in the fifth inning of a scoreless tie.

No starter recorded an out past the sixth inning of that World Series, and through four games of this one, the only starter to complete seven was the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw in Game 1. Kershaw, who threw just 83 pitches that night, was scheduled for a rematch with Dallas Keuchel in Game 5 here on Sunday.

The idea, Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said, is to predict when trouble might happen and avoid it, upending the traditional notion of riding a starter until he gets tired.

“Baseball’s very reactionary,” Roberts said, explaining that he tries “to be proactive and get ahead of something that potentially might happen — and to go a direction that might increase your chances marginally.”

The Dodgers have done this all year. In the regular season, they had the fewest starts in the majors of at least 100 pitches, with their pitchers reaching that threshold just 24 times — half by Kershaw. In the 12 games the Dodgers have played in this postseason, only Kershaw has thrown 85 pitches in a start.

“We’re very into analytics here, and numbers say the third time through the order, things kind of fall apart sometimes,” Morrow said.

“I don’t think we necessarily anticipated that with Woody throwing the ball as well as he was. Even though he gave up a home run there, he’s more than able to come back and throw two or three more innings, I’m sure. Games like this, you make the decision.”

Roberts’s decisions guided the Dodgers to 104 victories in the regular season, the most in the franchise’s six decades in Los Angeles. They now have a chance to finish this World Series at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday or Wednesday, so they might be onto something.

Yet, for Wood and his fellow starter Rich Hill — who was pulled after four innings, one run and just 60 pitches in Game 2 — the numbers do not spike drastically after the second time through the order.

Photo

In the regular season, Hill kept hitters to a .162 average when facing them for the third or fourth time in a game. Against Wood in such situations, the average was .222.

Then again, Roberts and Hinch — he of the similarly analytically-minded Astros — have reams of proprietary data to prepare them for nearly every possible in-game decision. They work closely with their front offices in a manner that the Yankees, who dismissed Joe Girardi last week after 10 winning seasons, will seek from their next manager.

Roberts invited scrutiny in Game 2 because after pulling Hill so early, the game went into extra innings and by the time it reached the top of the 11th Roberts was down to one reliever, Brandon McCarthy, who had not pitched in the entire postseason. McCarthy faltered and the Dodgers lost.

But those circumstances only arose because Jansen, who is normally infallible, blew the save in Game 2 after being handed a two-run lead in the eighth inning by the four Dodger relievers who preceded him.

When the other relievers hold a lead for Jansen, Roberts has essentially done his job, regardless of the final outcome. Even with meticulous planning, it is the players, not the manager, who control the results.

So it was in Game 4 of the Series, when Morton left with a 1-0 lead in the seventh inning but the bullpen gave up six runs behind him. It was natural to wonder what might have been had Morton stayed in the game, and Hinch understood.

“You can draw it out perfectly and map it out, but you never know how the other outcome would have been,” he said. “Everybody in baseball thinks that the other way would have been perfectly good, and we don’t know.”

We do know that bullpen usage is changing, and starters rarely determine the outcome on their own any more. They have gotten to the World Series this way, and accept it.

“We haven’t really had to work too hard so far in the playoffs,” Wood said, paying tribute to the Dodgers’ bullpen. “They’ve been absolutely nails.”",Next!

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

What I started to realize with the new one is, once somebody has this heroic moment, this kind of savior moment, the danger then becomes: What are the limits to your heroism?

[Laughs] Occasionally. And I will say, occasionally it’s super embarrassing. They’re becoming teenagers now — they’re like 14 and 15 — and so of course there are girl issues and body issues. They want to know about girls or a little bit about sex. They’re hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I don’t feel like it’s appropriate that I have those conversations with them. So I offer them little bits of advice and then generally go off and get a cup of coffee and wait until it dies down.

You’re like a cool uncle.

Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy who’s able to be on set saying, “All right, come on kids, let’s get down to work.” So in some ways I’m a cool uncle, and in some ways I’m like a nasty physics teacher.

Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?

No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to. One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didn’t want to become the dad on “Full House,” or whatever, who’s just a dad. Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce — you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.

You’ve said that you were once told that you were “too fat” to play the Blob. Now you’re playing a shirtless superhero. How hard is it to maintain a healthy body image as a man in Hollywood?

The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool — I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff. And I really couldn’t get that much work.

Then “Stranger Things” came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, “O.K. I’m going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.” And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism. In that first scene [in Season 1], where he’s shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: “Come on, this guy doesn’t work out. Play the character. Don’t play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.”

And that was where things turned around for me. It was like, “Oh, people want to see real human beings,” and I’ve been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity.

In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument. “We shouldn’t overemphasize the effectiveness of technology,” he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.

The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology. For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.

But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths. And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.

“You can’t teach people not to forget,” said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles. “There is a scientific reason why this is happening. It’s not that people don’t love their kids.”

David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten. Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription. Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.

“The brain process is the same,” Dr. Diamond said. “All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.”

General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing. If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds. The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year. The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.

This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child. Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.

Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices. One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing. The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat. If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.

Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.

When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, “I realized that while my car can tell me that, it can’t tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.”

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Jason Greene, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

In the airy front room, the low-slung sectional sofa is nothing more than blue vinyl cushions topped with blue cotton pillows. The adjacent blue coffee table is one of the three-legged stainless steel pieces, “1 on 2” and “2 on 1,” for which Nuriev is known, and which are sold by Not So General in West Hollywood. In the dining room, there are six chairs of the same color and design — where one leg is an arch that ingeniously doubles as the back — set around a long, blue-flecked marble table. In both the dining room and the kitchen hang pendant lamps Nuriev created out of blue-capped Bic pens. “Why these particular pens?” he asks rhetorically. “First of all, all Soviet kids had pens like these in school. Second, it’s my color.”

MANY OF US, let’s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that’s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev’s apartment is certainly photogenic — he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed — but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom — “it’s not like a website where you go and see pictures,” he says. “It’s honest.”

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html

Is there a saying about fish that live in glass barrels shooting themselves in the foot? Mr. Ostlund, whose film before this one was the squirmy, incisive “Force Majeure,” takes aim at some pretty fat satirical targets — art, taste, sex and money, for starters — and sprays buckshot at the audience as well as in his own face. The bad conscience of the cultural elite is hardly a new concern in European cinema (or American journalism, if we want to go there), and “The Square,” which won the Palme d’Or in May, uses some of the shock-the-bourgeoisie tactic refined, in recent years, by his fellow Cannes laureates Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier.

If Mr. Ostlund lacks Mr. Haneke’s rigor and Mr. von Trier’s sadism, he at least has a sense of humor. “The Square,” ragged and headlong, plays like a series of elaborately staged sketch-comedy routines. Or, closer to its own concerns, like an anthology of performance art pieces. Just about everything that happens to Christian has a conceptual dimension, an element of coy self-consciousness, that makes you wonder whether it’s just something that happened or a carefully planned and theorized happening.

Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian’s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world? What about Christian’s own daughters?

Donald Trump is not a problem solver.
“Donald Trump, the president.
Donald Trump, the salesperson.
Donald Trump, the troll.","A few weeks after Trump took office, The New York Post reported that Steve Bannon had identified Cuban as the No. 1 threat for 2020 because he could appeal to Republicans and independents.

“Bannon is a smart man,” smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.

I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautéed frogs’ legs.

But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”

When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent. I mean, I’d rather do it as an independent.” But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban’s neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)

Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?

The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”

He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”

He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.

“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’

“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”

He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.

“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”

Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”

Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.

But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.

He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”

In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.

But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”

I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”

“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)

Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.

Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?

“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.

“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”

He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”

Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.

His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.

Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”

Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.

He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.

“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”

Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.",Mark Cuban’s Not Done Trolling Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/mark-cubans-not-done-trolling-donald-trump.html

But I was one once, as were most of my female friends. In recent weeks, we’ve started to look back at our early career experiences in a new light. There are the painful memories of unwanted advances and hotel room invitations. And then there are the smaller moments that make up a larger narrative, one that can be hard to see when you’re just trying to live through it: the supervisor who stands too close at happy hour and peers down your shirt; the boss who grills you for questions about your romantic life; the promise of mentorship that, you realize only in retrospect, was imbued with something less innocent.

Stories of sexual harassment are almost always more complicated than the way they are represented in news coverage, and they don’t exist in a vacuum but as part of a broader culture. The incidents themselves don’t have to be traumatizing in the moment for them to accrue, over time, into a toxic pattern that hobbles a woman’s career.

A sexual harasser can do untold damage to woman’s self-esteem, forcing her to leave her job or even her profession. But that’s not the only pernicious outcome: She might tolerate the sexual harasser because at least he has been nice to her or taken an interest in her career. His offenses may seem minor amid the other frustrations that she suspects might have something to do with sexism but can’t ever be sure of, like the boss who’s casually dismissive of her every idea, or the mentor who feels he must tear her apart to bring out her true genius.

It can be hard sometimes, for both men and women, to fully understand what the right professional distance should be. But the problem is only compounded by the lack of more experienced women in positions of power to mentor their young counterparts.

In the days since the accusations against Mr. Wieseltier have gone public, I have been talking with former colleagues and replaying years of uncomfortable moments in my head, not just with him, but of everything from unwanted kisses to inappropriate comments and looks. None of it seemed worth reporting at the time. But now I am thinking about how those situations might have shaped the decisions I made, and the way I viewed myself as a professional. I know I am not the only one.

These small events have a way of adding up to a sense of displacement. It becomes harder and harder for a woman to look into the power structures she aspires to join and see herself as belonging — especially when there are so few women there to serve as examples. Even when there are other women at a similar level, being at the bottom rung of these organizations can be a very lonely place.

When a young woman is in a workplace where she feels replaceable, it is particularly dangerous for her to work with someone who is treated as utterly irreplaceable. Politics, like the arts, is full of men like this — so powerful that they become both synonymous with institutions and above them. In that kind of environment, it is not surprising that a man might feel entitled to take advantage, and a woman might feel there’s no recourse.

Lately, we are seeing something of a self-reckoning among well-meaning men. Speaking about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, his longtime collaborator, the director Quentin Tarantino, confessed, “I knew enough to do more than I did.” In Slate, the “Parts Unknown” host Anthony Bourdain wondered, “Why was I not the sort of person, or why was I not seen as the sort of person, that these women could feel comfortable confiding in?” Of Mr. Wieseltier, one former editor told HuffPost, “I accept I was blind and complicit and just, like, did nothing.”

All of this self-flagellation is heartening, particularly to women not accustomed to being believed or who have been told to just get over it. But it is not enough.

Real change will require the willingness of men to promote women and share power. It will mean more than promoting one woman and encouraging the other female employees to be more like her. It will mean investing in and promoting the women you work with and realizing that while many employees are talented yet also complicated and flawed, women are usually the only ones who suffer for it. And it will require a serious investment in the work and ideas of young women, so that they aren’t made to feel disposable anymore.",When You Are Replaceable and He Will Never Be,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/sexual-harassment-women.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Joyce formally renounced his dual citizenship after the scandal began and is now eligible to run.

“The decision of the court today is clearly not the outcome we were hoping for,” Mr. Turnbull said, “but the business of government goes on.”

The issue erupted in July when Scott Ludlam, a longtime Greens party senator from Western Australia, abruptly resigned after discovering he had retained New Zealand citizenship after becoming a naturalized Australian. While his supporters lamented the loss of a leader who had made a name with his stirring speeches and stern antinuclear stance, opponents accused the party of lackadaisical vetting.

Members of Australia’s most prominent parties began contacting foreign offices and consulates. To a mix of both broad amusement and dismay, five other senators — Matt Canavan of the Liberal National Party, Malcolm Roberts of the One Nation party, Fiona Nash of the Nationals, Nick Xenophon of the Nick Xenophon Team and Larissa Waters of the Australian Greens party — were found to have citizenship of other countries. So was Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister and House member.

On Friday, the court ruled that only Mr. Canavan and Mr. Xenophon had been eligible to run.

As the cases wound through the courts, the local news media named the group “the Citizenship Seven.”

Their situations varied. Some were born overseas and incorrectly believed they had renounced their citizenship rights. One senator, Mr. Xenophon, said he discovered that he held a rare type of British citizenship through his father, who left Cyprus before it gained independence from Britain. Another senator, Ms. Nash, said she was unaware she had been granted British citizenship by descent through her estranged Scottish father.

Mr. Joyce said he had not known he could be a citizen of New Zealand through his father until the local news media made inquiries to its Department of Internal Affairs.

Mr. Joyce’s chances of regaining his seat were bolstered after the ruling when his most formidable rival, Tony Windsor, declined to enter the race. But Mr. Joyce is likely to face other challengers.

Tanya Plibersek, the deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party, asked why Mr. Turnbull had allowed Mr. Joyce to stay in Parliament and make decisions despite facing the prospect that he would be declared ineligible.

“It is an extraordinary lapse of judgment from the prime minister,” she said.

Clive Bean, a professor of political science at the Queensland University of Technology, said Mr. Joyce’s party would probably keep the seat.

Still, voters may behave unpredictably in by-elections, he said. “Sometimes even a safe government seat may even be at risk because voters think, ‘Well, we’re going to send a message to the government in what we’re doing.’”

While the government would lose its formal majority in the lower chamber if Mr. Joyce does not win the by-election, it still has a tiebreaking vote in the speaker of the House, Tony Smith, a Liberal ally of Mr. Turnbull.

The government’s grip can be further solidified with the backing of independent members of Parliament. One such member, Cathy McGowan, has already said she would continue to vote in support.

The by-election is not the only concern Mr. Joyce faces, said Anne Twomey, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney.

“There may be legal challenges to decisions he’s made in the past, and that might be problematic,” she said. “This is all uncharted territory.”

In the cases before the High Court, the solicitor general representing the Commonwealth, Stephen Donoghue, had argued that five of the politicians, most of whom inherited citizenship, could not have known they held foreign citizenship without expert knowledge of foreign legal systems in relation to their family roots. Once they were aware, he argued, they had made reasonable efforts to renounce foreign allegiances and thus should not be disqualified from office.

To Mr. Donoghue’s surprise, two of the politicians in the cases — Mr. Ludlam and Ms. Waters — argued that all seven should be disqualified. Both resigned their positions after their dual citizenship came to light. Mr. Xenophon also announced his resignation but for an unrelated reason: to run for the lower house of the State Parliament in South Australia.

Mr. Xenophon said that although he had won his case, he felt sympathy for his colleagues who lost.

Ms. Sarsour, one of the organizers, said the convention had no regrets for having invited him.","Yet for all the disparate topics at this meeting, one thread ran through them all: opposition to the Trump administration and a pointed focus on elections next year. In small rooms, speakers led detailed training sessions for candidates at all levels: how to get the vote out, how to give a campaign speech, how to register voters, how to run for office.

No one knows how many women will ultimately seek elected office next year, but the leaders of Emily’s List, a national organization dedicated to advancing Democratic women in politics, said that since the day Mr. Trump was elected more than 20,000 women have contacted the group to say they want to run for office. By comparison, the group had heard from only 920 such women in the two years before the election, and that number had been a record high for Emily’s List.

“The goal here is for people to go back to their local communities and prepare for 2018 and to build power, register voters, engage more people, organize on a very hyper level,” said Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers of the Women’s March and of this convention, which leaders here view as the first of its kind since women met in Houston in 1977. “We’re excited to see what happens in 2018.”

After the Women’s March in Washington and the demonstrations around the country, some have questioned whether those efforts could keep up steam, particularly given the wide range of issues being raised. In the months since the marches, smaller groups, known as “huddles,” have met around the country. Organizers said more than 5,600 such meetings had occurred, and pointed to the turnout at the weekend convention, as well as the number of potential female candidates, as more evidence that a sustained movement had emerged.

“For the folks that say, ‘O.K., you had this march and what’s going on with the energy?’: When I go out there, it’s everywhere,” said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List, which helped sponsor the convention. Of the women voicing interest in running, she said, “We really see this as the next decade of candidates for office.”

Somewhat murkier, though, was precisely what would mark success — for the 2018 elections and for this meeting. Some here said the essential goal was seeing Democrats win control of Congress next year. Others said a main aim was that women turn out to vote in far larger numbers or that women win local and state races in unprecedented numbers, building a deep bench of future candidates for national slots.

“What I know is this: It will be tough to wake up the day after the 2018 election if we don’t have a good showing, maybe even harder than it was to wake up the day after the 2016 election,” said Alannah Boyle, 21, a student from New York City who rode nearly 12 hours with seven others to attend the Detroit convention. “We are doing so many small acts of resistance, and it’d be hard if there aren’t the results.”

The convention, held in the vast downtown Cobo Center and titled “Reclaiming Our Time” (a play on remarks by Ms. Waters at a House committee meeting), drew a wide range of women: old and young, and of different races, ethnicities, religious backgrounds and hometowns. Some people paid $295 to attend the conference, though many said they had been granted scholarships to come. The gathering included a lineup of female Democratic senators, but also local activists, would-be candidates and ordinary voters. Some men also attended, although Senator Bernie Sanders, who had been expected to speak, did not.

Before the weekend began, critics complained that Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, ought not to be offered a high-profile speaking slot, given that it was a convention for and about women. The debate created a split among some here, creating tension during some events; panelists on one stage noted that some convention participants had threatened on social media not to come (or even to throw a separate convention) if Mr. Sanders appeared.

Ultimately, Mr. Sanders announced that he would instead spend the weekend in Puerto Rico, which is still reeling from Hurricane Maria. Ms. Sarsour, one of the organizers, said the convention had no regrets for having invited him. “We think he’s been a champion of women,” she said. “We are a women-led movement. We are the ones who set the strategy but we believe men are part of the fight.”

The convention was held in Detroit, organizers said, because the region had suffered many of the problems people were facing around the country: economic struggles; questions about police conduct and race relations; a crisis, in nearby Flint, over a poisoned water supply.

Women here said it was essential not to judge progress too quickly; change, they said, took time and could head in different directions, not a single line.

“One of the things I was concerned about early on was maybe we’d get numb to this environment we’re in and we haven’t at all,” said Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat running for governor of Michigan, who spoke at a January march in Lansing, Mich. “This is not just a one-weekend event. This is about giving people tools to stay active and to grow our grass-roots effort.”

Rita Smith, 63, of Denver, said she was unsure whether the movement would produce results in the next election. “I don’t know,” she said. “I’m not sure. I feel like people are committed to that right now. I guess we’re not going to know until November 2018 for sure if the commitment is long-term and the commitment is real. I hope it is.”","At Women’s Convention in Detroit, a Test of Momentum and Focus",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/women-convention-detroit-march.html

To the Editor:

We live in a polarized time in which people and things are reflexively seen as either good or evil. But people are complicated, and so is art, and so is the making of art. Artists are in many ways outsiders. We count on them for that, to reveal things about life and about ourselves we’d otherwise miss.

The flip side is that they’re often on close terms with humanity’s dark side. History is full of artists who were awful people and still great artists. Wagner was a virulent anti-Semite, but his music is still beautiful. Picasso was no saint, and neither was Sinatra.

Few would argue that artists are above the law. But if art is to serve its proper function in society, it needs to be taken on its own terms, not as a referendum on the artist’s moral standing. Otherwise it just becomes more fodder for the culture wars. And do we really need any more of that?

DAVID SHACK, NEW YORK

To the Editor:

Whether we like it or not, our watching a Woody Allen movie, or a rerun of “The Cosby Show,” or the work of any of the other offending creative people promotes them by, if nothing else, putting money in their pockets, further enabling them to misbehave.

And more fundamentally, the offending creative people violate our society’s “in the best interest of our children” test. We do not want our children to think it’s O.K. to misbehave in the adult world as long as you are “creative.”

WOOWON JAY LEE

ROLLING HILLS ESTATES, CALIF.

To the Editor:

While everyone must draw his or her own red line in deciding whether to watch or attend an event by a person who has behaved reprehensibly, it is important to note that moral outrage has a limited shelf life. People either forgive, forget or simply move on. How long that takes depends on the severity of the offense and how personally affected the injured party is.

At some point people started going to Woody Allen movies again, Mel Gibson was nominated for an Academy Award and people bought cars from German manufacturers. People must search their soul and draw their own line.

Sheila Levin’s letter implies that whether one goes on enjoying an artist’s work is a decision. It certainly isn’t for me, and I find myself wondering whether it could be for anyone.

Bill Cosby is a fixture of my childhood. I watched “The Electric Company” and “Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids,” the latter religiously, and owned a couple of his stand-up recordings. When I had kids of my own, I made them listen to the routine about Fat Albert’s car, which is powered by an airplane engine. Mr. Cosby’s sound effects are just plain brilliant.

JAKE HOLDEN, ALBANY

To the Editor:

In an ideal world, I believe that the artist would be invisible and unknown. The art would stand alone. Its message would be judged on its expression of beauty and truth.

Could we ignore the art of Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Mozart if we learned that these artists lived “ignoble” or “sinful” lives? Would the life cancel the revelations in the art? By what standards can one judge the artist’s life?

Could we ignore a scientist’s discoveries if he or she lived a reprehensible life? I think not!

EDITH LAUTEN, SCARSDALE, N.Y.

To the Editor:

I think it is a matter of personal choice and degree. Sometimes very flawed people make great art. There is nothing inherently wrong in admiring work produced by a less than admirable person.

“The Cosby Show” told the story of a bright, cool, educated and successful family that was black. It was brilliant and timely work, and I believe that it did a lot to educate the general public as well as entertain it. Admiring someone’s work, whether it be a Cosby or a Picasso, does not amount to an endorsement of his or her personal shortcomings.

Let the courts decide if these people are criminals. Regarding the art they leave behind, reach your own decision about it.

CARMEL, N.Y.

To the Editor:

The question has been asked and answered many times. It surfaces regularly when thinking about the composer Richard Wagner, for example. He behaved badly during his lifetime, and his personal reputation only got worse after being exalted by the Nazis more than half a century after his death. Yet audiences today seem generally to be able to deplore his conduct while admiring his works, which are performed all over the world.

This is even easier to understand when considering Harvey Weinstein, who is known primarily as a financier and distributor of art rather than as a creator. If we consumed only those products brought to us by nice people, I am not sure we could survive as a species.

That said, everyone has a yuck-threshold.

PETER VELIKONJA, BROOKLYN

To the Editor:

How should we separate the work from the reprehensible acts? First, will our enjoyment of the work further enrich the artist? Second, does the work in question in some way make a mockery of the reprehensible acts? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, then probably it’s best not to partake of the work. If the answer is no, then what difference does it make?

ADY ADEFRIS, HONG KONG

To the Editor:

Whenever this issue is raised, I tell people about my uncle, Victor Fitz, an Auschwitz survivor who bought me my first recording after the war, Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony played by the Berlin Philharmonic and conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, because he felt it was the best. Furtwängler, though anti-Nazi himself, was criticized for playing for Hitler during the war, but, regardless, my uncle saw him as a great conductor directing a great orchestra.

I always admired him for his fortitude and for his willingness to separate his tragic experience — including the fact that his wife did not survive the camps — from his artistic judgment. I always felt that if people like him could do that, who are we to quarrel?

“Rules are rules.”","“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”

The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.

After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?

Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.

Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.

Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.

The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.

Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.

Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.

Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.

“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.

He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.

Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.

“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”

Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.

That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.

“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.

The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.

In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.

Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about one million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.

Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Well, Michael Moore succeeded in getting the president’s attention.

On Saturday evening, six days after “The Terms of My Surrender,” Mr. Moore’s solo show decrying President Trump, closed on Broadway, the president took a gleeful jab at the liberal provocateur on Twitter.

Mr. Trump’s assertion that the show “was forced to close” is incorrect. The show had been announced in May as a 12-week limited run, and it ran the full 12 weeks.

“Michael Moore’s Broadway show was always meant to be a limited engagement,” said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show. “It closed, as planned, on Sunday, Oct. 22. It was not forced to close early.”

Mr. Trump’s assertion that the show was “a total bomb” is a matter of opinion, and in a barrage of tweets late Saturday, Mr. Moore declared his show a “smash hit” before touting his production and taunting the president.

Given the show’s limited run and modest grosses, neither the phrase “total bomb” nor “smash hit” seems to be a precise description of its financial performance. The capitalization costs are not public for “The Terms of My Surrender,” which was produced by IMG Original Content and Carole Shorenstein Hays.

When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage.
To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter.","So here you are, long after the discovery of a liaison that, if not adulterous, was certainly adulter-ish. Your wife is still angry with you, still feels aggrieved and mistrustful. You’ve gone to counseling, but she hasn’t reconciled herself to a husband who, early in a marriage, was swapping sexual pics with another woman. You think she’s being unpleasantly manipulative; she may think she’s reminding you that you’re on probation, that you have further to go to earn back her trust.

It’s often said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In this case, your marriage is now on its sickbed. One issue here is how much you and your wife value it. That’s hard for an outsider to assess. Anger, like love, isn’t a voluntary emotion; you can’t simply decide to dial it up or down. But surely your wife isn’t the only angry spouse in your marriage. You say you felt emotionally abused by your wife even during the affair (a serious complaint); you think your relationship isn’t healthy, “but it’s what I’ve got” — not exactly a Hallmark sentiment. Do you truly think that getting rid of those pics would fix what’s wrong here? If your counselor made a list of what was rotten in your marriage, I doubt your wife’s vengeful lock screen would make the Top 10.

I have been divorced for many years. My ex-husband is now married to a dentist. As part of our divorce agreement, I am responsible for the children’s health insurance, including dental coverage. There were no issues until I had a brief period of unemployment. When I got a new job, it included health and dental insurance, but there was a waiting period for coverage. To cover that brief period, I bought health insurance for myself and my children but did not purchase dental insurance.

During that time, my ex-husband took our daughter to the dentist for a checkup. The dental practice my daughter visits is her stepmother’s office. When my ex-husband sent me the bill for this visit, which came to $400, I asked if the visit could be postdated by just a day, so I could submit it for insurance. He told me that doing so was illegal and that I needed to pay, and that he didn’t appreciate the fact that I didn’t have any dental coverage.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I asked my daughter why she didn’t let me know about the appointment so I could let her know our dental insurance ended. She said she thought that because it was her stepmother’s office, she was fine.

Since that time I have been receiving bills from this dental practice. I have had conversations with their accounts-payable department to let them know that my daughter is the dentist’s stepdaughter. But no understanding was reached; I have not paid, as I believe it’s wrong to have charged me when it was known that I didn’t have company insurance at the time. I am now getting bills from a collection agency for the $400.

So my question for you is: Do I pay it just to make it go away or try again to reason with my ex-husband and his wife to please drop these fees? Name Withheld

Communication between ex-spouses can be like pulling teeth. So it’s not surprising that you didn’t warn your husband that it would be financially inconvenient for your daughter to have dental treatment at that time. Given that you are in charge of medical insurance, you could reasonably think it odd that your child was taken for a dental visit without your knowledge. But again, not so surprising, especially if your daughter’s teeth are normally looked after at her stepmother’s office.

While your husband is correct that it would be wrong and could be illegal to file a false claim, he and his wife might have been able to help you by agreeing to lower the costs or to spread them out. The fact that the charge was sent to a collection agency also sounds less than cordial. Still, if I understand the situation correctly, you were in breach of your divorce agreement, even if your reasons were entirely understandable. Absent any information from you to the contrary, then, he was entitled to assume that your daughter was covered. You’re asking him and his wife to cover costs that you are liable for. I’m afraid you’d better bite down and pay up.",My Wife Found My Sexy Phone Pics and Won’t Let It Go,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/my-wife-found-my-sexy-phone-pics-and-wont-let-it-go.html

On the album, Ms. Shyu is joined by a string quartet and her jazz septet, Jade Tongue. At 8:30 on Friday, she will perform the suite with a five-piece band, then will give a solo concert at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Minding Mother and Her Purse Strings

‘The Treasurer’ at Playwrights Horizons

Max Posner’s play about a grown son managing his ailing mother’s finances, closes its purse strings on Nov. 5. Ben Brantley admired how this “tender and unforgiving” play, directed by David Cromer, “adroitly balances the everyday and the extreme.” ALEXIS SOLOSKI

FILM SERIES

Men of Principle, and Pals as Well

‘Hank and Jim’ at Film Forum

A companion series to a new book about the friendship between Henry Fonda and James Stewart, this retrospective (Friday through Nov. 16) positions them as a study in contrasts. Friday offers two Hitchcocks: In “Rope,” Mr. Stewart is the voice of moral reason while foiling Leopold-and-Loeb-like killers; in “The Wrong Man,” Mr. Fonda plays a jazz musician mistaken for a holdup man. On Saturday, Stewart is a credit to the Senate in Frank Capra’s “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” and Fonda is an open-minded juror in Sidney Lumet’s “12 Angry Men.” BEN KENIGSBERG

DANCE

Embracing Your Inner Skeleton

Armitage Dance! Gone at La MaMa

Karole Armitage has long infused ballet with a dark look, a wild defiance and a sharp edge. For her latest work, “Halloween Unleashed: Dancing Bones, Tasting Darkness and the Skeleton Within,” she has added to that brew the 1929 Disney cartoon “The Skeleton Dance” and the spirit of Haitian carnival. Set to a score ranging from Marilyn Manson to David Lang and original music by Terry Dame, the result is a toothy treat for a fun and ghoulish holiday. (At 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Friday, 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Saturday, and at 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday.) BRIAN SCHAEFER

ROCK & POP

Hail the Queen of Darkness

Diamanda Galas at Murmrr Theater

Halloween offers a yearly opportunity for musicians to indulge their theatrical impulses. This week, you might stumble across small indie acts cosplaying as superfamous rock stars (at Gutter Bar on Oct. 27-28 and the Glove on Oct. 28, among other locations), or enjoy the stoner-rap group Cypress Hill’s “Haunted Hill” show at Brooklyn Steel on Oct. 30. The most chilling option of all is this engagement on Sunday and Tuesday by Diamanda Galas, the avant-garde queen of darkness, whose recent album “All the Way” is a fantastically eerie take on the American songbook.

FOR CHILDREN

Halloween Festivals Where the Scariest Specter Is Extinction

‘Boo at the Zoo’ at the Bronx, Queens and Prospect Park Zoos

Halloween promises a wild time, and few places do that better than those where wild creatures reside. Each year these zoos host weekend celebrations that educate about animals as well as entertain young humans. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Bronx Zoo offers a Haunted Forest, with both wildlife models and scary apparitions,and the Extinct Species Graveyard, a fake cemetery devoted to a real threat: vanishing creatures. Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, anda costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater , above. The Queens Zoo ’s festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife — meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example — and a haunted trail for people. The Prospect Park Zoo , whose “Boo” runs 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a Spooky Barn, is focusing on bats, whose activities are more helpful than horrifying. And who could resist a dance party alongside sea lions, which are pretty inventive movers themselves? LAUREL GRAEBER

Somehow, the kidnapping turned into what may have been an accidental killing, leading to “the largest U.S. manhunt since the Lindbergh kidnapping.” Although Jett’s chronological narrative is pretty straightforward, certain forensic details, like the use of fingerprint analysis and dental records, should please techno-wonks — as should the fact that the case was solved by identifying varieties of paper stock and models of typewriters.

Did the smog smother the murders or did the murders obscure the smog? That’s the terrible question Kate Winkler Dawson raises in DEATH IN THE AIR: The True Story of a Serial Killer, the Great London Smog, and the Strangling of a City (Hachette, $27), her deeply researched and densely atmospheric study of two intersecting events in London, the murder spree of John Reginald (Reg) Christie and the Great Smog of 1952.

It was bitter cold that December, prompting the city’s eight million residents to pile on the coal briquettes and draw close to the fire. At the time, Britain was selling its best black coal to foreign countries and palming off the dirty brown stuff on its own people, who couldn’t afford the better coal anyway. But this cheaper means of heating proved deadly, asphyxiating 4,000 Londoners and leaving thousands more gasping. The death toll was so high that undertakers ran out of coffins. Shifting weather patterns contributed to the disaster, trapping pollutants over the city, grounding planes and suspending traffic. Theaters, hotels and restaurants operated on reduced staff when workers were unable to report; in any case, few of their patrons were willing or able to venture out. Day after day, the “peasouper” hung in the air and the roaring fires burned in the city’s hearths. “Swirls of fog,” Dawson explains, “were romantic and beguiling to Londoners.” And the “affinity for an open fire was virtually a requirement for being British.”

Meanwhile, the fog rolling over 10 Rillington Place proved a satanic blessing, smothering the little garden where Reg Christie was industriously planting the bodies of the eight women he’d killed. (Ironically, he’d enticed some of them into his flat with the promise of a special cough medicine that would clear their smog-filled lungs.) This diligent gardener wasn’t entirely secretive about what he was up to, even using a human thighbone to prop up the garden fence. “ ‘Neighbors watched me digging,’ he said. ‘They nodded ‘cheerios’ to me.’ ” Until he was brought to trial the following year, the infamous “Beast of Rillington Place” may have been the only person in London to delight in the Great Fog.

Any book with “Belle Époque” in the title puts me in mind of Woody Allen’s enchanting fantasy film, “Midnight in Paris,” in which Pablo Picasso’s mistress and her present-day American lover travel back in time to the glorious era when Paris was the playground of great artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas. John Merriman’s BALLAD OF THE ANARCHIST BANDITS: The Crime Spree That Gripped Belle Époque Paris (Nation Books, $28) tells another story of that era — not the romance of the “Ville Lumière” with its dazzling palaces and grand hotels but the dark tale of a city in the grip of a crime wave. “The guidebooks never mentioned the quartiers populaires,” Merriman notes, “or the impoverished suburbs of Paris, where most of the workers who ran the trams, built the popular new cars and cleaned the city lived.” It took the anarchists to argue, often violently, that working people were suffering from “increased mechanization, the decline of apprenticeship, the increase in piece rates, speedups and the beginnings of scientific management in large factories.”

Photo

Merriman’s subject is the rise and fall of the Bonnot Gang, but he shrewdly wraps his historical analysis in the arms of a love story. Rirette Maîtrejean and Victor Kibaltchiche met on the battlements of the class war, which fueled their affair and gave it purpose. But Jules Bonnot, the leader of their gang, was more committed to plunder than to the cause. “Our blood pays for the luxury of the wealthy” went the anarchist battle cry. “Our enemy is the master. Long live anarchy!” Yet Bonnot just wanted to get his hands on that upper-class loot.

Some true-crime books aren’t the least bit romantic, and they’re usually the ones that break your heart. Dashka Slater wrote THE 57 BUS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.99) for teenagers, but her audience should also include parents. The two youngsters from Oakland, Calif., whose paths cross so disastrously are both extremely likable. Sasha, a boy who attends a small private school and “identifies as agender,” is on the bus going home when Richard, a junior at the public high school who’s goofing off, puts a lighter to the gauzy skirt Sasha’s wearing. The skirt goes up in flames, Sasha receives second- and third-degree burns, and Richard is accused of two hate-crime felonies. Charged as an adult, he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.

Slater, who wrote a shorter account of this story that ran in The New York Times Magazine, views these bare facts from a firm sociological perspective. Sasha comes from a nice neighborhood up in the hills. Richard lives in the flatlands of East Oakland, where two-thirds of the city’s murders occur. “The schools are shabbier here; the test scores are lower. There’s more trash on the streets, more roaming dogs, more liquor stores, fewer grocery stores.” Slater doesn’t apologize for Richard; she just asks us to consider where he came from and to question the ingrained prejudice of a legal system that eventually locked him up for five years. Even Sasha’s father recognized that what Richard did was “impulsive, immature and unpremeditated.”

Michael Arntfield makes the most of the local crimes he covers in MAD CITY: The True Story of the Campus Murders That America Forgot (Little A, $24.95) by hitching them to some of Wisconsin’s more flamboyant murder cases. Regional pride was excuse enough to bring up notables like the “Plainfield Ghoul,” Ed Gein (“a serial killer and body snatcher whose crimes inspired the Robert Bloch novel and subsequent Alfred Hitchcock film, ‘Psycho,’ as well as the comparatively down-market ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ franchise that followed”), and the “Milwaukee Cannibal” Jeffrey Dahmer. Not to mention the “Vampire of Düsseldorf,” an infamous German murderer whose mummified head came ashore in the baggage of a returning World War II soldier. (It continues to be the prize attraction in a little museum in the tourist town of Wisconsin Dells.)

Arntfield presents his murder case as “perhaps the greatest story never told in American history, at least the history of American crime.” Like his literary style, that claim is overblown. But the story of Christine Rothschild and Linda Tomaszewski still deserves to be told. In 1967, the girls met and became friends at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The late ’60s were a time when protest marches were replacing pep rallies and coeds no longer wanted to be called coeds. Christine had a room on the ground floor of Ann Emery Hall, a genteel women’s residence with “no controlled entry, no intercom, no cameras or convex mirrors, and no sign-in book.” She was unaware that a stalker was paying her nightly visits (by way of her window) until he stepped up his twisted courtship with creepy phone calls.

Once she’d identified her stalker as 42-year-old Niels Bjorn Jorgensen, a third-year medical school resident, Christine told the campus police, whose advice was simply to stay alert and buy a rape whistle. Luckily, she’d also confided in Linda. Christine wound up beaten and stabbed to death, and her friend was the only person with the grit to pursue Jorgensen — across the country, for 40 years! As a grim reminder of what he’d done, for many of those years Linda also sent him a card on Valentine’s Day.

Among the other reasons Manfred cited for delaying the suspension, this stands out: “I felt it was unfair to punish the other 24 players on the Astros roster,” he said. “I wanted the burden of this discipline to fall primarily on the wrongdoer.”

Denying Gurriel a chance to help his team in the World Series would have severely affected him. It would also have allowed a fleeting gesture — an ugly one, for sure, but one that was done in the dugout, not on the field, and that did not appear to be premeditated — to unduly influence the World Series.

And yet, given that reasoning by Manfred, these tough words from him on Saturday — “There is no place in our game for the behavior or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night” — seem somewhat contradictory. Gurriel, after all, is still playing.

But Manfred was right in saying that World Series games are far more significant than a midseason game for the Oakland A’s or the Toronto Blue Jays. Maybe that sounds crass, but there is no disputing it. And while Manfred would not declare five games as the new standard price for intolerant words or actions during a game — he said he would deal with each situation on its own merits — the penalty for Gurriel does exceed all recent punishments, including the three-game ban given to Yunel Escobar, then of Toronto, for wearing eye black inscribed with an anti-gay slur in 2012.

Gurriel, for his part, said after Friday’s game that he was surprised by the furor over his gesture. He mentioned his experiences in Japan — he played for the Yokohama BayStars in 2014 — and said that he respected Japanese people.

“I did not want to offend anybody,” he said through an interpreter.

As for his characterization of Darvish as a “chinito,” a word that can be demeaning to Asians, Gurriel said that in Cuba, the term applies to anyone who is Asian, not just to Japanese people, although that did not amount to much of an excuse.

In any case, he added that he understood he was wrong. In a statement on Saturday, Gurriel apologized to Darvish and called his gesture “indefensible.”

Not surprisingly, both managers in the Series were asked to comment on Gurriel and his punishment.

“We support everything that’s right about this game, and we’ll move forward, if everyone will allow us to,” Astros Manager A. J. Hinch said. “Knowing Yuli, knowing what he will do to convince everyone that this incident was not in his heart, will be key.”

Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who was born in Japan and whose mother is Japanese, said he approved of the way Manfred had handled the incident.

Gurriel, who was batting .340 in the postseason and was in the starting lineup for Game 4, has delivered on his promise since the Astros signed him for five years and $47.5 million after he defected last year. He made a smooth transition from third base to first while batting .299 with 18 homers, 75 runs batted in and 43 doubles this season.

“He’s a great hitter,” said Jose Altuve, the Astros’ star second baseman, “one of the best I’ve ever seen, to be honest with you.”

It was, officially, Gurriel’s rookie season. But at 33 years old, after playing professionally for 15 seasons in Cuba and Japan, Gurriel is a rookie in name only. He comes from a prominent baseball family in Cuba, and spent most of his prime years there.

“I could have left at 22 or something like other players and spent their entire careers here and maybe that would have been better,” Gurriel said in Spanish at a workout in Los Angeles on Monday. “But no, I don’t regret it. I had the chance to play my entire life in Cuba and enjoy those great moments, and the chance to play in Japan. God wanted me to be here in this moment now, and I’m enjoying this.”

The Astros have such a deep offense that their leader in runs batted in, Marwin Gonzalez, batted eighth in Game 3. That suits Gurriel, who said he felt pressure to carry his Cuban teams but does not have the same feeling here.

“In Cuba, if I didn’t hit, I lost,” he said. “If I did hit, it was normal and what I was supposed to do. So it was really hard to please people. It’s been different here in this lineup.”

At the same group interview in which he made those comments, Gurriel was asked a question by a Japanese reporter. He answered with a few words in Japanese before continuing in Spanish.

“I identified a lot with the Japanese public,” Gurriel said. “It was a really great experience.”

Yet with one gesture on Friday, Gurriel turned what should have been an experience to celebrate into something much different. And left Manfred to untangle it.","Manfred Makes His Choice: Punish Gurriel, but Leave the World Series Alone",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/sports/baseball/with-one-gesture-yuli-gurriel-upends-his-impressive-season.html

One reason is that as humans we’ve evolved to survive in groups, not alone. Rallying together makes us feel less alone in the experience, explained the sociologist Christine Carter, a fellow at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley.

“When our survival is threatened, we are going to reach out and strengthen our connections with people around us. We show generosity. We show compassion. We show gratitude. These are all emotions that function to connect us with each other,” Dr. Carter said.

Scientific evidence supports the idea that acts of generosity can be beneficial when we volunteer and give back regularly — and not just after a natural disaster. Volunteering is linked to health benefits like lower blood pressure and decreased mortality rates.

Dr. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has been studying the effects of positive emotions, such as compassion and kindness, on the brain since the 1990s. He said the brain behaves differently during an act of generosity than it does during a hedonistic activity.

“When we do things for ourselves, those experiences of positive emotions are more fleeting. They are dependent on external circumstances,” he said. “When we engage in acts of generosity, those experiences of positive emotion may be more enduring and outlast the specific episode in which we are engaged.”

Helping others also gives us a sense of purpose. Dr. Linda Fried co-founded Experience Corps, a program that engages retirees as literacy tutors, after she discovered a strong association between a sense of purpose and well-being throughout life. Older adults who volunteered to help children with reading and writing tended to experience less memory loss and maintain greater physical mobility, one study suggested.

Giving back is a fundamental teaching of many religions. Jesus had the Golden Rule. Buddha said in order to brighten one’s own path, one must light the path of others.

During a trip to India in 2016, I experienced firsthand how the benefits of doing good are well established in Indian society. I paid a visit to a Vedic astrologer because I was anxious about an uncertain future, my own personal crisis, and received a list of prescriptions to help others to get through it. The first task was to buy a black-and-white checkered blanket, then visit a local leper colony and donate it to the first person I saw. My next task was to buy a six-pound bag of lentils, circle it around my head, chant a Sanskrit mantra and give it to a homeless person.

Certainly, many Westerners would roll their eyes at these unconventional “prescriptions,” but they were familiar to my Indian friends, who believe they hold real power.

Later, to better understand the significance of the rituals, I reached out to Dr. Deepak Chopra, author of “You Are the Universe.” He said the philosophical underpinnings in India come from the Vedas and Buddhist traditions, where “all human suffering is a result of the hallucination of the separate self.”

Dr. Chopra explained: “The moment you identify yourself as separate from other beings, or other people, or separate from life in general then you will suffer. And it all begins with initial anxiety because when you’re disconnected from people and life, you feel fear, and that creates the beginning of suffering.”

Would Western doctors ever prescribe acts of generosity? Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, doesn’t rule it out.

“We have sufficient scientific information to justify a very significant public health initiative,” he said. “If there were a retiree in my office I would ask them, ‘Do you smoke? Do you exercise? What is your diet like?’ I should also be asking them if they volunteer.”",Why Doing Good Is Good for the Do-Gooder,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/well/mind/why-doing-good-is-good-for-the-do-gooder.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention?
This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment.
More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough.
In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing.","Remember Anita Hill, who told a firing line of skeptical senators the story of constant harassment by her boss, Clarence Thomas, more than 25 years ago. The lawmakers, every one of them male, seemed less concerned with the alleged misconduct of a Supreme Court nominee than that a woman would drag such a tawdry subject into the halls of Congress. While Ms. Hill’s brave testimony prompted a sharp rise in sexual-harassment claims, she was vilified in public; nearly twice as many Americans said at the time that they believed now-Justice Thomas’s account of what happened over hers.

Remember former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity endures despite a long string of allegations of sexual misconduct and, in one case, rape — all of which he has denied. Mr. Clinton did eventually admit to the affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, that nearly toppled his presidency, but he pointed out that it was not illegal.

Then, of course, there’s the current occupant of the Oval Office, who won the election only weeks after the public heard him brag about grabbing women’s genitalia, and who once said that if his daughter were ever sexually harassed at work, she should go find a new job. That president leads a party intent on passing laws that would re-establish gender norms and hierarchies from the middle of the last century (Defund Planned Parenthood! No abortions after six weeks!) — making it harder for women to attain the social equality and economic independence that would go a long way toward reducing sexual harassment in the workplace.

In other words, even the highest-profile opportunities to change America’s endemic culture of sexual harassment, which is overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, committed by men against women, can somehow be lost or swept away. How do we keep that from happening again?

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention? The answer is part cultural, part economic and part legal.

The most conservative estimates say 25 percent of women have experienced sexual harassment at work, although the real number is surely much higher, since only a small fraction of such behavior is ever reported. As many as 90 percent of workers who are harassed never file a formal complaint, according to a 2016 report by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which receives more than 12,000 complaints of sex-based harassment each year.

The reasons for this silence are obvious: Women fear retaliation, indifference or disbelief if they speak up. If it’s hard for rich and famous people, so many of whom kept silent in the face of Mr. Weinstein’s well-known depredations, imagine how much harder it is for someone with no political or economic power. But the Weinstein saga also illustrates what a difference it can make when women join together — and men join with them — to confront harassers openly.

HOW TO CHANGE THE CULTURE The key is to foster work environments where women feel safe and men feel obliged to report sexual harassment. “People need to be afraid not just of doing these things, but also of not doing anything when someone around them does it,” Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, told The Times’s Nicholas Kristof last week. “If you know something is happening and you fail to take action, whether you are a man or a woman — especially when you are in power — you are responsible, too.”

But speaking up only goes so far if employers don’t make reporting harassment easy or the consequences for harassers swift and clear. Treating sexual harassment seriously is essential, not to protect against liability or to safeguard the bottom line, but because it’s wrong for anyone to have to endure harassment at work. (Though it sure helps when liability and the bottom line are at stake, too.)

Some of the nation’s largest companies are moving in the right direction. For example, McDonald’s, Burger King, Aramark and Walmart have signed on to a program requiring their tomato growers to adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits sexual harassment and assault of farmworkers, and provides a clear system for the growers’ 30,000 workers to file complaints. Fourteen businesses are part of the program; many more should join.

IT’S ABOUT POWER AND MONEY Sexual-harassment culture is tied directly to the economics of the workplace. Since harassment is about power, it’s no surprise that it thrives in industries where women are systematically kept out of powerful roles — and paid less for doing the same work as men. (This may help explain why sexual-harassment cases make up nearly half of all harassment complaints from the private sector, but less than 10 percent of those from employees of the federal government, where women have more opportunities to rise to positions of authority.)

Photo

Too often, male harassers use their economic power to silence women, as Mr. Weinstein and Mr. O’Reilly did repeatedly, offering them hefty payments in return for signing nondisclosure agreements. If employers were more responsive and harassment cases were easier to pursue in the courts, there would be fewer of these settlements, which can be good for individual women but allow the predatory behavior to continue unchecked.

One compromise could be to require businesses to report how many sexual-harassment claims they settle every year, or even how many complaints they receive. This would at least give prospective employees a chance to assess how bad the problem is at a given company, and could lead to greater public scrutiny in more extreme cases.

LEGAL BARRIERS The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion and other protected classes. Twelve years later, it made employers liable for supervisors’ harassment of workers. But in 2013, the court stepped backward, ruling that employers are liable only for racial or sexual harassment by a supervisor who has the power to fire a worker or prevent his or her promotion. In a 5-to-4 ruling, with only male justices in the majority, the court held that employers are not automatically liable for harassment by the larger number of supervisors who don’t have that power, even if they control all other aspects of a worker’s daily activities.

In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the decision ignored the realities of the modern workplace, and the “particular threatening character” of a supervisor’s power and authority, even one not vested with the power to fire. A worker who confronts a harassing supervisor risks “receiving an undesirable or unsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She may be saddled with an excessive workload or with placement on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family life.”

Congress could and should overturn that ruling today by passing a law that reinstates the broader and more realistic definition of a supervisor. But good luck with that; Capitol Hill can’t even keep its own house in order. Representative Jackie Speier of California, who said she was sexually assaulted years ago when she was a congressional staff member, told Politico on Thursday that the compliance office tasked with handling harassment complaints is “toothless,” and said that Congress has been “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.”

This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment. The elements for a permanent cultural shift are certainly in place. More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough. More women than men are graduating from college; more are earning advanced degrees; and increasing numbers are managers, though the proportions of women still become thinner and thinner the higher in management you look. And, crucially, the internet and social media have opened a door to instant communication and community support that didn’t exist before, helping women feel less isolation and shame about their experiences, and more confident that speaking out will have a positive result.

In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing. Boys must be raised to understand why that behavior is wrong, teenagers need to be reminded of it and grown men need to pay for it until they get the message.",Will Harvey Weinstein’s Fall Finally Reform Men?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html

There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch.

The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers.

But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission.

The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.)

The fact that the internet has leached attention and relevance away from television is only part of what’s befuddling this show — plenty of television is premised on digesting and commenting on things that happen online. But those shows — say, “Desus & Mero,” or even late-night talk-show monologues — specialize in personalities and commentary. “TRL” is a mishmash and has the additional problem of trying to build a tentpole television series out of the component parts of internet personalities, who are generally poorly suited to the task.

That’s true of the musical guests, many of whom found fame online and aren’t kiln-fired in the glare of camera lights.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

Lower Ninth Ward

Travel east through the city’s French Quarter, Faubourg Marigny and Bywater neighborhoods and you’ll reach the Lower Ninth Ward. The Industrial Canal, which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River and allows cargo ships to pass, essentially cuts off the neighborhood from the rest of the city. This forged a unique culture in the area, which was largely swampland and was drained at the turn of the 20th century, with mostly working-class residents settling the land.

The Domino family lived in a narrow shotgun house on Jourdan Avenue that no longer exists, within sight of the eastern levee of the canal. In his book, Mr. Coleman describes how Mr. Domino “walked the dirt path of Jourdan Avenue to St. Claude Street, lighted in those days only by oil lamps in the houses and the stars above.”

Mr. Domino was rather shy as a child and left formal schooling during the fourth grade. He then had a succession of jobs, from an ice deliveryman helper to stable boy at the New Orleans Fair Grounds to coffee factory worker. During this time, Mr. Domino also learned how to play the piano, a pivotal part of his young life that would come to define his long career.

Even while Mr. Domino was achieving dizzying success, touring the country extensively and embarking on his first European tour in 1962, he preferred to keep his roots in New Orleans.

New Orleanians often spotted Mr. Domino driving around the city in his pink Cadillac. For decades, he resided in the Lower Ninth Ward at 1208 Caffin Avenue with his wife, Rosemary, who died in 2008. The property consists of a shotgun-style building and a corner building trimmed in pink. With a sign that reads “Fats Domino Publishing” and the initials F and D on the front of the home, this landmark property is easily identifiable.

In 1965, Hurricane Betsy brought severe flooding to the neighborhood after the levee protection system was breached. In 2005, flooding from Hurricane Katrina levee breaches was even more catastrophic, emptying the Lower Ninth Ward of much of its population, including Mr. Domino. Many buildings from his young adulthood were razed after they were deemed inhabitable. After initially riding out the storm, Mr. Domino had to be rescued by boat and subsequently decided to live with one of his daughters in Harvey, on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish.

After Mr. Domino’s death, the Lower Ninth Ward property quickly became a makeshift memorial, with admirers visiting to pay their respects and leave personal mementos to commemorate his life. The property presents an opportunity to see a slice of the city that has dealt with a great deal of tumult, but also one that always embraced Mr. Domino and paved the way for his first forays into rhythm and blues.

Central Business District

Canal Street, with its swaying palm trees and bustling streetcar lines, serves as a grand gateway to the heart of the city. In Mr. Domino’s heyday, the street also showcased the dichotomy between the bustling economic engine of the city, and at the time, lower-to-middle black class areas like the Lower Ninth Ward.

The lyrics to “Fat Man” highlight the busy corner of Rampart and Canal, where the black and white worlds of the city, respectively, merge:

I was standin’, I was standin’ on the corner Of Rampart and Canal I was watchin’, watchin’ Watchin’ all these Creole gals

Mr. Domino deftly references Creole culture, acknowledging the mixed-race women who descended from free black citizens. The lyric is a continued recognition of the somewhat fragile racial realities of the time, as well as a nod to his own background.

French Quarter

At the intersection of Rampart Street and Dumaine Street, on the northern edge of the French Quarter, a nondescript laundromat is in the former home of the J&M Recording Studio. The studio, opened by the recording engineer Cosimo Matassa, was designated as a Historic Rock and Roll Landmark by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2010, with songs including “Fat Man” and Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight” having been recorded at the location. Mr. Coleman describes the recording session for “Fat Man” as lasting almost six hours, which was not unusual for Mr. Domino, as he generally practiced his songs religiously.

In the Central Business District and straddling the border with the French Quarter is the old State Palace Theater, which operated as a Loew’s Theater during Mr. Domino’s adolescence. The original building, which was constructed in 1926 and features over 3,000 seats, remains intact, but redevelopment plans remain unclear. Mr. Domino went to the State Palace frequently in the 1940s.

“I used to see Gene Autry movies all the time,” Mr. Domino told Mr. Coleman, adding that he also saw “Roy Rogers, the Three Musketeers, and John Wayne.”

The nearby Civic, Joy and Orpheum Theaters, which all rose to prominence from the late 1900s to the ‘40s, underwent extensive renovations and continue to welcome new generations of audiences.

Mr. Domino’s performances in the 1990s and early 2000s at the House of Blues were highly anticipated and well-received, a testament to his enormous staying power.

New Orleans

Mr. Domino was a master at fusing music genres like rhythm and blues, jazz, boogie-woogie, gospel and even country. His love for New Orleans always remained a major theme in his musical universe. Performances at the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, fittingly held at the Fair Grounds where he once worked as a boy, always brought out legions of his fans. In his later years he played to smaller crowds, including a 2007 set at Tipitina’s Uptown, one of his last public performances.

In the song, “Walking to New Orleans,” Mr. Domino describes the sense of belonging and optimism that the city holds. Despite the sad circumstances, the song is upbeat and refreshingly personal:

I’ve got no time for talkin’ I’ve got to keep on walkin’ New Orleans is my home That’s the reason why I’m goin’ Yes, I’m walkin’ to New Orleans I’m walkin’ to New Orleans

At the time of Mr. Domino’s death, he was 89 years old. New Orleans shaped his work ethic and songwriting throughout his life, a testament to his ability to connect people through music.

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend.
Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse.
“He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams.
After all, if your spouse is your best friend, then whom do you complain to your spouse about?","There is some research into this question. John Helliwell is a professor at the Vancouver School of Economics and the editor of the World Happiness Report. As he researched social connections a few years ago, he found that everyone derives benefits from online friends and real-life friends, but the only friends that boost our life satisfaction are real friends.

“But while the effects of real friends on your well-being is important for everybody,” he said, “they are less so for married people than for singles. That’s how we got to the idea that marriage is a kind of ‘super-friendship.’”

Dr. Helliwell and a colleague discovered that a long-running study in Britain had data that may illuminate this question. Between 1991 and 2009, the British Household Panel Survey asked 30,000 people to quantify their life satisfaction. In general, married people expressed higher satisfaction, he said, and were better able to manage the dip in well-being that most people experience in middle age, as they face work stress, caring for aging parents and other pressures.

Photo

But an entirely separate part of the study asked people to name their best friend. Those who listed their spouse were twice as likely to have higher life satisfaction. Slightly more men than women made that choice, he said, “which makes sense, because men tend to have fewer friends.”

Is feeling this way about your spouse necessary for a good marriage? I asked.

“Absolutely not,” Dr. Helliwell said. “The benefits of marriage are strong even for those who are littered with outside friends. It’s just bigger for those who consider their spouse their closest friend. It’s a bonus.”

Others are not so sure.

Amir Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University, and the co-author of “Attached.” A student of social relations, Dr. Levine explained that everyone has what he calls a hierarchy of attachment, meaning if something bad happens to us, we have a ranking of the people we call. In our early decades, those on the highest rungs are usually our parents or other family members.

“The problem as you grow older is, how do you let somebody close who’s basically a total stranger?” he said. “Nature came up with a trick: It’s called attraction. Sexual attraction brings down all the barriers, lets you get close to a new person in a physical way that you don’t get close to your family.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Over time, of course, this physical connection wanes. While many bemoan this loss of titillation, Dr. Levine celebrates it. “It’s smart,” he said. “If you’re going to be crazy about the other person all the time, how are you going to raise kids? How are you going to be able to work?”

Instead of complaining, we should view this new phase as an achievement: “O.K., now I have this person I’m attached to. I have the feeling of security. That’s what allows me to be an individual again and self-actualize.”

It’s this feeling of security, Dr. Levine says, that leads us to describe our spouses as “friends.” But that language is not quite right, he says. First, couples still need what he calls “maintenance sex,” because it re-establishes physical closeness and renews attachment.

Second, the term “friendship” is “an underwhelming representation of what’s going on,” he said. “What people basically mean is, ‘I’m in a secure relationship. Being close to my partner is very rewarding. I trust them. They’re there for me in such a profound way that it allows me to have courage to create, to explore, to imagine.’”

Dr. Levine summarizes this feeling with the (somewhat awkward) acronym Carrp; your partner is consistent, available, responsive, reliable and predictable. But don’t we already have a word, “spouse,” that fits this description? I said. Why are we suddenly using the expression “best friend,” when that doesn’t seem to fit at all?

“Because not every spouse provides that,” he said, “and we’re indicating we don’t take it for granted. What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”

There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend. The words mean totally different things.

Peter Pearson and Ellyn Bader are founders of the Couples Institute in Menlo Park, Calif., and the authors of “Tell Me No Lies.” They’ve also been married for more than 30 years. Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse. “One of the criteria for a best friend is you feel unconditionally accepted,” he said. “Do I care if my buddy Mark is messy in the kitchen, leaves his bathroom a shambles and doesn’t pay his income taxes?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But with a spouse, he said, you can’t avoid these topics.

Dr. Bader said that when couples are just getting to know each other, they often say they’re companions, and she’s fine with that. When couples have been together 30, 40 or 50 years, they use similar language, and that can be the mark of a healthy relationship.

“It’s the in-between ones, when they use the language of friendship, my stomach turns,” Dr. Bader said. “It’s a red flag for a lot of conflict avoidance and intensity avoidance. It often means they’ve given up on the complexity of being with somebody. Instead of saying, ‘Oh, well, that’s who they are,’ it’s better if they try to work things out.”

Dr. Bader said that she wished popular magazines would challenge the notion that you shouldn’t get married to change someone. “I think that’s what marriage is about,” she said. “It’s where some of the juices come from, and it’s also how you get the best out of the person you marry.”

A good marriage, she said, is when people “push each other, challenge each other, encourage each other and, yes, change each other.”

Asked if they were best friends, they laughed. “We’re good friends,” Dr. Pearson said.

“Really good friends,” Dr. Bader said. “He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”

And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams. But in the end, the expression doesn’t do justice to the full meaning of marriage or to the full meaning of friendship.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

The pesticide, which belongs to a class of chemicals developed as a nerve gas made by Nazi Germany, is now found in food, air and drinking water. Human and animal studies show that it damages the brain and reduces I.Q.s while causing tremors among children. It has also been linked to lung cancer and Parkinson’s disease in adults.

The colored parts of the image above, prepared by Columbia University scientists, indicate where a child’s brain is physically altered after exposure to this pesticide.

This chemical, chlorpyrifos, is hard to pronounce, so let’s just call it Dow Chemical Company’s Nerve Gas Pesticide. Even if you haven’t heard of it, it may be inside you: One 2012 study found that it was in the umbilical cord blood of 87 percent of newborn babies tested.

And now the Trump administration is embracing it, overturning a planned ban that had been in the works for many years.

The Environmental Protection Agency actually banned Dow’s Nerve Gas Pesticide for most indoor residential use 17 years ago — so it’s no longer found in the Raid you spray at cockroaches (it’s very effective, which is why it’s so widely used; then again, don’t suggest this to Dow, but sarin nerve gas might be even more effective!). The E.P.A. was preparing to ban it for agricultural and outdoor use this spring, but then the Trump administration rejected the ban.

That was a triumph for Dow, but the decision stirred outrage among public health experts. They noted that Dow had donated $1 million for President Trump’s inauguration.

So Dow’s Nerve Gas Pesticide will still be used on golf courses, road medians and crops that end up on our plate. Kids are told to eat fruits and vegetables, but E.P.A. scientists found levels of this pesticide on such foods at up to 140 times the limits deemed safe.

“This was a chemical developed to attack the nervous system,” notes Virginia Rauh, a Columbia professor who has conducted groundbreaking research on it. “It should not be a surprise that it’s not good for people.”

Remember the brain-damaging lead that was ignored in drinking water in Flint, Mich.? What’s happening under the Trump administration is a nationwide echo of what was permitted in Flint: Officials are turning a blind eye to the spread of a number of toxic substances, including those linked to cancer and brain damage.

“We are all Flint,” Professor Rauh says. “We will look back on it as something shameful.”

Here’s the big picture: The $800 billion chemical industry lavishes money on politicians and lobbies its way out of effective regulation. This has always been a problem, but now the Trump administration has gone so far as to choose chemical industry lobbyists to oversee environmental protections. The American Academy of Pediatrics protested the administration’s decision on the nerve gas pesticide, but officials sided with industry over doctors. The swamp won.

The chemical industry lobby, the American Chemistry Council, is today’s version of Big Tobacco. One vignette: Chemical companies secretly set up a now-defunct front organization called Citizens for Fire Safety that purported to be a coalition of firefighters, doctors and others alarmed about house fires. The group called for requiring flame retardant chemicals in couches, to save lives, of course.

A photo posted on the Facebook page of Citizens for Fire Safety. Despite its name, the organization represented chemical companies, not concerned members of the public.

In fact, this was an industry hoax, part of a grand strategy to increase sales of flame retardants — whose principle effect seems to be to cause cancer. The American Chemistry Council was caught lying about its involvement in this hoax.

Yet these days, Trump is handing over the keys of our regulatory apparatus to the council and its industry allies. An excellent Times article by Eric Lipton noted that to oversee toxic chemicals, Trump appointed a council veteran along with toxicologist with a history of taking council money to defend carcinogens.

In effect, Trump appointed two foxes to be Special Assistant for Guarding the Henhouse.

Some day we will look back and wonder: What were we thinking?! I’ve written about the evidence that toxic chemicals are lowering men’s sperm counts, and new research suggests by extrapolation that by 2060, a majority of American and European men could even be infertile. These days we spew fewer toxins into our air and rivers, and instead we dump poisons directly into our own bodies.

A Dow spokeswoman, Rachelle Schikorra, told me that “Dow stands by the safety of chlorpyrifos” (I don’t think the company approves of my branding it Dow’s Nerve Gas Pesticide). Given Dow’s confidence, I suggest that the company spray it daily in its executive dining rooms.

Look, it’s easy to get diverted by the daily White House fireworks. But long after the quotidian craziness is forgotten, Americans will be caring for victims of the chemical industry’s takeover of safety regulation.",Trump’s Legacy: Damaged Brains,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/chlorpyrifos-dow-environmental-protection-agency.html

Mr. Oldenburg’s latest exhibition, “Shelf Life,” is on view until Nov. 11 at Pace Gallery’s 24th Street branch in Chelsea. The relatively small works are made of cardboard, plaster, steel and wood. They depict assemblages of objects — some familiar to Oldenburg fans, like a saw, a basketball hoop and a paintbrush — on gray shelves made to look just like the storage units Mr. Oldenburg has in his studio.

Mr. Oldenburg sat down in his New York studio, accompanied by Mr. Glimcher, to talk about making art and where his ideas come from. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

It’s been awhile since we saw new Oldenburgs, correct?

MR. GLIMCHER Except for the paintbrush in Philadelphia, this is his first new body of work in six years.

MR. OLDENBURG Is that right?

A.G. Yes, you’ve been focusing on the big public projects.

C.O. What’s wrong with that?

A.G. Nothing!

A lot of people know you from large pieces like “Spoonbridge and Cherry” in Minneapolis. How do you feel about them?

C.O. Public things take two or three years, they’re made out of heavy stuff, which is also very costly. That’s what the big projects are: working in architecture. You need someone who backs it and who trusts you, and whom you trust. You need to be more than yourself. For example, I had Coosje van Bruggen, my late wife, and she was very smart, and very good and kind, and we worked together on them.

How long do the two of you go back?

C.O. The beginning of the ’60s. After a couple of years in New York, I started to go into something different than painting.

Why?

C.O. Everything changed. You could paint a very beautiful picture of somebody and nobody would care. Everybody was doing something different. It was explosive, and it was the beginning of a new period of art. You could do almost anything.

Photo

A.G. There were very few revolutions in sculpture, and Claes’s soft sculptures made up one of the great revolutions. It was the antithesis of what sculpture previously was about. Sculpture was hard.

But you didn’t start with soft sculptures, right?

C.O. I came to New York in ’56, and I didn’t have very much money. I started to buy Life magazines, and I started to cut things out of the magazines, and that was my first American statement, these collages. They’re kind of scary, some of them, and they’re definitely hard to interpret.

Perhaps your work has a darker undercurrent than some realize?

C.O. Oh yes, I totally agree with you. That was a period when I made a lot of dirty work. I did a lot of erotic drawings.

A.G. The Museum of Modern Art just recently bought the biggest, most explicit, erotic drawing actually.

That brings up the fact that you once depicted the human figure, but not for decades. Why not?

C.O. People have become objects. I think there’s a point at which you choose between a person and things. And I chose things. And you can express just as many things about persons by using things.

Did the softness of bodies somehow transfer to sculpture?

C.O. Yes. I spent a lot of time painting human beings, especially nudes. And you might say that’s a source of the interest in soft things.

The works in “Shelf Life” are relatively small. How long does it take to make them?

C.O. It takes as long as it takes. I would say you put things together in maybe a week or two, and then pull them apart for a week, and then you find another idea that sneaks in and so on.

But do you work most days?

C.O. Of course. I try to anyway. Some days are wonderful, and some days are awful. That’s how things go. This group of things was started earlier this year. Part of the reason it’s on a small scale was because I wasn’t exactly sure where I was going at that point.

Photo

A.G. Each of these shelves is a store of ideas. There’s a kind of nostalgia — in the best sense — about these works. The history of your whole visual vocabulary is here.

C.O. Yeah. I haven’t been showing that kind of work. This will be the first time.

A.G. Claes, you said something touching to me: “You have to decide at some point what you’re going to keep and what you’re going to throw away,” and obviously these are things that you kept.

Is there something that inspires that decision?

C.O. I want to be working all the time. Why suddenly I should go into this? I haven’t quite figured that out yet.

I sort of like the scale of this work, because I can handle the scale at my age. I like small things. That’s a fact. I like big things, but I also like small things.

What small things have your attention now?

C.O. I have a fly on this table; he’s here all the time. I don’t know where he’s gone now.

A real fly? Oh — I think I just saw him buzzing around.

C.O. I don’t think I’ve seen anything much more interesting than that in some time.

You know, when I grew up in Chicago, there were so many flies you could hardly see anything. The world was all flies. But now they’re just not like that anymore. There are maybe one or two or three flies that take a liking to you. I hate to see people go and smash them.

But Mr. de Blasio was vague about many details and claimed not to remember important interactions.

Mr. Rechnitz testified on Friday that Mr. de Blasio had asked him at one point to appeal to Mr. Seabrook to tamp down his criticism of the correction commissioner, who at the time was Joseph Ponte.

“I have no memory of that at all,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Prosecutors in the trial showed an email, sent to the mayor’s personal email address, in which Mr. Rechnitz reported to the mayor that Mr. Seabrook was “under control.”

“I don’t remember that email,” Mr. de Blasio said on Saturday.

Mr. Rechnitz also testified that he had a close relationship with Ross Offinger, a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio’s campaign.

People who study these things have observed a marked increase in solitary “happiness pursuits” — activities carried out either completely alone or in a group without interaction — with the explicit aim of keeping each person locked in her own private emotional experience.

Spiritual and religious practice is slowly shifting from a community-based endeavor to a private one, with silent meditation retreats, mindfulness apps and yoga classes replacing church socials and collective worship. The self-help industry — with its guiding principle that the search for happiness should be an individual, self-focused enterprise — is booming, with Americans spending more than $1 billion on self-help books a year to help guide them on their inner journeys. Meanwhile, “self-care” has become the new going out.

But while placing more and more emphasis on seeking happiness within, Americans in general are spending less and less time actually connecting with other people. Nearly half of all meals eaten in this country are now eaten alone. Teenagers and young millennials are spending less time just “hanging out” with their friends than any generation in recent history, replacing real-world interaction with smartphones.

And it’s not just young people. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time Use Survey shows that the average American now spends less than four minutes a day “hosting and attending social events,” a category that covers all types of parties and other organized social occasions. That’s 24 hours a year, barely enough to cover Thanksgiving dinner, and your own child’s birthday party.

The same time-use data also allocates another, broader category to “socializing and communicating,” a designation that includes not just the good stuff — the heart-to-heart with an adoring spouse, or setting the world to rights with a dear friend over a bottle of wine — but any kind of socializing and communicating at all between two adults, where this is their main activity rather than an incidental part of something else, like working. All in all — and that includes daily bouts of nagging, arguing and whining — the average American spends barely more than half an hour a day on social communication. Compare that to time per day spent watching television (three hours) or even “grooming” (one hour for women, and just over 44 minutes for men).

Self-reflection, introspection and some degree of solitude are important parts of a psychologically healthy life. But somewhere along the line we seem to have gotten the balance wrong. Because far from confirming our insistence that “happiness comes from within,” a wide body of research tells us almost the exact opposite.

Academic happiness studies are full of anomalies and contradictions, often revealing more about the agendas and values of those conducting them than the realities of human emotion. But if there is one point on which virtually every piece of research into the nature and causes of human happiness agrees, it is this: our happiness depends on other people.

Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life, even going so far as to call them a “necessary condition for happiness,” meaning that humans can’t actually be happy without them. This is a finding that cuts across race, age, gender, income and social class so overwhelmingly that it dwarfs any other factor.

And according to research, if we want to be happy, we should really be aiming to spend less time alone. Despite claiming to crave solitude when asked in the abstract, when sampled in the moment, people across the board consistently report themselves as happier when they are around other people than when they are on their own. Surprisingly this effect is not just true for people who consider themselves extroverts but equally strong for introverts as well.

What’s more, neglecting our social relationships is actually shockingly dangerous to our health. Research shows that a lack of social connection carries with it a risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking, and is roughly twice as dangerous to our health as obesity. The most significant thing we can do for our well-being is not to “find ourselves” or “go within.” It’s to invest as much time and effort as we can into nurturing the relationships we have with the people in our lives.

If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.
“She put her arms around me.”But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.
Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).
As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.","She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers. After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other women’s experiences with Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over — the assumption that money or threats could buy women’s silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway. While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.

A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that “Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.” Ms. McGowan’s lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.

By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider — someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years. Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein — and the public conversation about what’s wrong with Hollywood — seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.

On Friday, at the inaugural Women’s Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker — a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick. “I have been silenced for 20 years,” she told the gathering. “I have been slut-shamed. I have been harassed. I have been maligned. And you know what? I’m just like you.”

A Crusade Gathers Strength

As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.

When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinstein’s history, she wrote in a tweet: “‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face,” adding, “The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.” (Mr. Affleck declined to comment.) She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies — “you are guilty of human trafficking,” she wrote — and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misconduct.

When Twitter suspended her account — the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number — users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed. The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowan’s blistering attacks, a moody still of her from “Grindhouse” in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought. “Get ’em, Rose,” he wrote.

On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge. “I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay — a lot of monster energy,” said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean. “I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.” Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past. Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.

If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan. Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing — “kind of like a witch’s cackle,” she clarified. But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation. The phone had come to feel too powerful: “It’s like a live wire that you’re holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain,” she said.

The Meeting and the Aftermath

Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter. Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, “Going All the Way.” She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film “Scream,” on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.

Ms. McGowan’s manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment. On her arrival, the maître d’ directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinstein’s suite, she said. Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in. “They wouldn’t look me in the eye,” she recalled.

She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting. But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub. “And then what happened, happened,” said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape. “Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.”

She declined to share the details of the encounter. “That’s my story to tell,” she said emphatically. But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event. She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck. She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred. “She held me,” Ms. McGowan said. “She put her arms around me.”

But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team. She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless. “She was like, ‘You’re an actress, you’ve done a sex scene, you’re done,’” she recalled.

Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messick’s office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messick’s calls. “I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle,” Ms. Woodward said. “She wanted to fight.” No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct. “It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated,” Ms. Woodward said. “That’s what stuck with me.”

Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messick’s request and confronted him with Ms. McGowan’s claim. “I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior,” Mr. Wechsler said.

Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000. Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein. Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.

At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Rose’s aunt, “almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.” He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Rose’s grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school. Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.

Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others). “Rose was never this sweet, simple soul — there was always something ferocious about her,” Ms. Corman said. “After that assault, a light dimmed. I remember her souring on the powers that be. And she became very protective of us. It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.”

Ms. McGowan’s friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself “the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.” (“I ran away for three years and joined the circus,” Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.) She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude. “That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted,” she said. “And I thought — you want to see a body? I did it with a giant middle finger.”

Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired. “I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with weren’t as great as the people she had before,” said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.

Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another. But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on “Phantoms,” a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table. “And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing,” she said.

She continued to work, on “Charmed” until 2006, but also in independent films. Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as “Grindhouse,” directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino. It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s brother. As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered. “I was really lost at that point,” she said. “I was damaged.”

Shunning ‘Celebrity’

It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowan’s career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred. She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit. “I never considered myself a celebrity,” she said at one point. “I hate that word. It’s tawdry.”

Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood. In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions. (Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)

In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Renée Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actress’s plastic surgery. “How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?” she wrote, in a direct accusation of the piece’s writer, Owen Glieberman.

“It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses,” said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times. “Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.”

And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim. “You are taking part of someone’s soul,” she said. “It’s happened to me.” Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.

During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona. She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach. She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half — her book, “Brave,” which will be released by Harper One early next year.

To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news. But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: “I knew we are legion. We are legion.” She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press). “It feels,” Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, “‘like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.’ That’s what the whole experience feels like to me. It’s an intense process.”

Sometimes she feels fresh rage. “But I’ll tell you what I don’t feel anymore,” she said. “Despair.”","Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — David Steinberg has come a long way from his New York Times Crossword debut as a 14-year-old in 2011 (for those of us over the age of 40, that would be last Thursday). He’s now a student at Stanford University and — in his spare time — edits the crossword puzzle for The Orange County Register.

He still has time to create crosswords for The Times, and Mr. Steinberg will be adding an additional crossword to his rotation.

“I’m now editing a daily 15x15 crossword for [the syndicator] Andrews-McMeel/Universal,” he reported. “The puzzles, which go live in a few weeks, will all be Tuesday-Wednesday New York Times difficulty, including two Wednesday level themelesses at the end of each week.

UNPLUGGED My Saturday is just my Friday. So Sunday is the day I decompress. If I’m being honest, Sundays are for chilling. I wake up pretty late. I cook, French toast and turkey bacon. I watch “Martin.” I turn my phone off. It’s an energy-drain, scrolling for no particular reason.

FASHION SPEAK I pull from everything around me and try to put them into conversation — Spike Lee, Air Jordan. It’s about cultural literacy, the language of being fly. If I’m going shopping, I’m hitting Bloomingdale’s on 59th and Lexington, and Brooklyn Circus on Nevins, which is where I host the book club. It’s more window shopping. I ask, ‘What do I have in my wardrobe that keeps me fluent in what’s going on?’ ‘What outfit will allow me to enter into as many possible spaces?’ I might get one piece.

WHAT SWAG IS I was born in the South Bronx. I have one brother and three sisters. We lived in shelters and navigating the housing system. My mom made our clothes from scratch. Her father was a tailor. She knew fabrics, she knew texture. “Don’t just go by the brand.” She was big on instilling in us that we were more than what we had in our pockets. She was big on making sure we weren’t Frankensteined together. That’s what swag is.

LIKE STOCKS I watch sales like stocks. I watch them to the point where they practically can’t find the other shoe, which is another reason to go shopping on Sunday, because it’s chill, it’s more relaxed. One of the stores to go to is Scotch & Soda. They make the best denim at a good price.","How Yahdon Israel, of #LiterarySwag, Spends His Sundays",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/how-yahdon-israel-of-literaryswag-spends-his-sundays.html

I tiptoed through upside-down rooms and kitchens with rumbling floors, past sinks running with blood and candles sliding along mantels, and declined housekeeping from an undead maid.

A bonus: After making it through the inn, we were invited to sit and watch, on jumbo screens, a video of our harrowing stay.

Horseman’s Hollow

(Ages 10 and up, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.)

Photo

At 7 p.m. that same Saturday, the line for Horseman’s Hollow was full, and devil horns ($3.95 at the gift shop) glowed red on many a head. Ghosts in tricorn hats chased shrieking SUNY students. A local market sold doughnuts and cider. Inspired by “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Historic Hudson Valley staged Horseman’s Hollow on the grounds of Philipsburg Manor, converting the historical site into a colonial town gone mad. Think fewer clowns, more yellow fever.

I followed a lantern-lit trail along the Pocantico River toward the old manor. Signs along the path warned of the Headless Horseman, but mostly it was just nice to be out of the city.

Decapitations were, fittingly, all the rage in the town. “Let’s see how you laugh without a windpipe,” one lobbed-off head barked through planks of wood.

“Welcome to my garden,” a crone beckoned, and I proceeded cautiously, worried she’d push a farm share.

In a dark barn, ghosts in flowing, glowing sheers oscillated like tower fans. A zombie nun stopped eating a dead soldier’s entrails to scream at me, then the dead soldier popped up to scream as well.

“Oh, God,” I whimpered as I stepped into a foreboding temple.

“You’re right,” a satanic figure atop the throne said. “I am God.”

Winding outdoor paths provided a moment to catch my breath before the next hazy tent or demon’s Airbnb. I paused in the cemetery to let pass a woman who had been loudly telling her friend an unrelated childhood story since we’d left the fortune teller’s camp — what is this, the Moth? Pipe down!

Outside the schoolhouse, Ichabod Crane jumped out. “He’s real!” he cried, pointing.

Looming up ahead, in front of the manor, the Horseman sat ominously on a real horse. “No flash!” a handler snapped at the people in the crowd who had their phones out like Justin Bieber was on that horse and we were all in Montclair, N.J.

Back at the entrance, the ghouls entertained the crowd with a Mad-Libbed shanty, incorporating someone’s oh-so-Hudson-River-Valley suggestion: “401(k).”

At 11 p.m., the line for Blood Manor stretched down Varick Street. Now in its 13th season, this Manhattan haunt caters to an older, clubgoing set — no doughnuts, no cider. Speakers blasted Cardi B while a stilted man carrying a scythe stalked the line and posed with people in front of a step-and-repeat backdrop.

Inside, it was loud and hot. For 20 feverish minutes, throughout 18 different rooms, I fended off attacks from an ax-wielding contortionist, an undead stripper dancing across from, well, a dead stripper impaled on her pole, and a doctor who leapt across his operating table toward me, growling, “It’s just you and me, big guy.”

Ever wondered what you’d do if you were kidnapped? I sure haven’t.

From Psycho Clan, the team behind Nightmare New York, This Is Real simulates a group abduction in an isolated Red Hook warehouse. Only eight people are admitted during each time slot, and everyone must sign a waiver beforehand. Because most of the other times were sold out, I was given a 3 p.m. Sunday slot, a good option in case you and your aunt can’t get into “Hello, Dolly!”

I stood outside the warehouse with my fellow abductees: a group of male friends and a guy who’d driven two hours from Connecticut. Threatening greeters circled us, murmuring, “Introduce yourselves. You will need each other.”

Two of my biggest fears were already being engaged: a broken fourth wall and a bunch of straight guys depending on me for their survival.

Inside we were blindfolded, bound at the hands and led one by one into narrow cells. I wriggled free of my bindings and raised my blindfold just in time to watch the stocking-capped killer spray a tied-up woman with a gas that made her woozy. He ran down our row of cells, spraying us as well.

“You’re pretty,” he said to my neighbor, and, to me, “I’m attracted to you.”

“Thank you,” I nearly purred back.

He hauled the woman out, and we had to unlock our cells and scour the filthy, sparse room for ways to escape without getting caught. Every few minutes we heard whistling, which meant the killer was approaching, and scrambled to hide. I wasn’t fast enough the first time.

“Dead!” he shouted, pointing at me, as earsplitting horror movie strings swelled. (Luckily, you get three lives.)

The boys tore through our room while I tried to look busy. “Here,” one of them said to me, “I’ll hoist you up to that electrical box, and see if you can find anything.” I longed for the killer’s whistle.

I survived the 70-minute ordeal, hiding in a refrigerator two rooms back, abandoned by the others. The greeters, no longer threatening, took our photo for the Instagram page and recommended Botanica across the street for a drink.

“It’s not much cooler out there,” a greeter said, pushing the warehouse doors open.

Oh, right — out there. I took a deep breath, steeled myself and stepped back in.

“Suburbicon,” a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock. This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.

The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.

Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”

Video

The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.

Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html

“It still feels a little quiet for a gubernatorial race,” said Senator Mark Warner, the state’s senior Democrat.

But the stakes in Virginia for Democrats nationally are high. The party has failed to win any significant races since President Trump’s election, and the fundamentals are weighted in their favor in Virginia, where the president is deeply unpopular and the last time a Republican won a statewide top-of-ballot race was in 2009, when Bob McDonnell’s election as governor presaged Republican gains nationally the following year.

Outside the Washington suburbs, Republicans dominate vast swaths of the state, mainly in areas where the population and economy are flat or declining. The political divide mirrors a fractious cultural one that has played out in fights throughout the state over whether to remove Confederate monuments, ban sanctuary cities or round up immigrants in the country illegally. If the core constituency that helped Democrats carry the state in the last three presidential elections does not turn out, it will be that Republican Virginia that prevails.

“It’s really not old vs. new,” said David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the state legislature representing the region. “It’s NOVA vs. ROVA, Northern Virginia vs. the Rest of Virginia.”

With its thriving technology sector and data centers that sprout up like the crops that preceded them on one-time farmland, Northern Virginia is the economic engine of the state, attracting a diverse, highly skilled and well-paid work force, many of them immigrants.

“The three major metropolitan areas in the state (Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads) contain more than 90 percent of the total growth,” Qian Cai, director of demographic research at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said in an email. She also noted that “between 2010 and 2016, 45 of Virginia’s 95 counties witnessed population decline.”

Virginia’s immigrant population grew four times as fast as its native-born population from 2007 to 2015, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, bringing its numbers to about one in eight Virginians. And more than two-thirds of the state’s immigrants live in Northern Virginia.

In Loudoun County, several elementary schools are majority South Asian. The area is also home to one of the largest mosques on the East Coast. Vietnamese and Korean immigrants have long been a presence. And, as in other places across the country, the number of Latinos moving into the area is growing rapidly as well.

Many of these immigrants, who tend to be socially and fiscally conservative, are not naturally Democrats. But Mr. Ramadan and others said Republicans’ harsh approach to immigration has driven them to be Democrats, and it may be difficult to get them back.

“They are people of faith. They came here for less government. They are natural voters for the Republican Party,” Mr. Ramadan said. “But they are also emotional voters. They want to feel accepted. They want to feel welcome, but the Republican Party has failed to do so. Democrats have done a much better job.”

Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman who represented Northern Virginia, said he saw the transformation happening “under my feet.”

“We are losing ethnic voters en masse,” Mr. Davis said. “Vietnamese, Koreans used to be the backbone of my vote. They are very Republican in the way they live their lives, but I saw the immigration issue just turn it south.”

In a presidential election year, Democrats have been able to rack up large majorities in the counties near Washington. But turnout drops substantially in off-year cycles, and Republicans can capitalize on a more loyal core of voters.

Turnout among immigrants is not the only concern for the Northam campaign. He will need another crucial part of the Democratic coalition: African-American voters in Northern Virginia, Richmond and the Hampton Roads area. Mr. Northam has been trying to stoke energy in urban areas, and former President Barack Obama recently appeared with him at a rally in Richmond.

“I think the big question for me on the election is: Can Lieutenant Governor Northam excite the traditional Democratic voting base in Northern Virginia and the urban centers,” said Bill Bolling, a Republican former lieutenant governor.

That explains why both Mr. Gillespie, who as a national party leader tried to reach out to minority voters, and Mr. Northam, who some Republicans once wanted to try to recruit to switch parties, have been running campaigns aimed at base voters, with Mr. Gillespie emphasizing crimes by illegal immigrants and pledging to oppose sanctuary cities — even though Virginia does not have any — and Mr. Northam trying to yoke his opponent to Mr. Trump.

Mr. Ramadan said he ran as a conservative and won a district that was 60 percent Democratic in his state delegate race from a Loudoun County district.

“I have been telling my party until there is no breath left in me, you truly need to widen the tent and not just talk about it,” Mr. Ramadan said. “And start working the new voters of Virginia and not the old voters that are shrinking in Southwest. The future is Northern Virginia. The future is the Asian vote. The future is the Latino vote.”

Mr. Warner’s career has tracked the tensions between old and new. He was elected governor in 2001, largely by mitigating losses in rural areas by devoting large amounts of time to campaigning there.

It worked for him then, and again in 2008 when he won his first term in the Senate. Even as the state’s voting population was changing, though, he barely defeated Mr. Gillespie in 2014 to keep his Senate race, losing even rural areas where he had been popular. The new voters in Northern Virginia did not turn out, and the rural voters Mr. Warner had courted spurned him.

It is an open question now whether it is even worth a Democrat’s time to try to win those rural areas, given the possible yield to be had by campaigning more vigorously in Northern Virginia. But the transition from old to new Virginia is still evolving.

From her fifth-floor office, Phyllis J. Randall, a Democrat and the first African-American woman to lead a Virginia county board of supervisors, can look down on the courthouse square in Leesburg, the Loudoun County seat. Just beyond her view is a monument to Confederate soldiers that has been the subject of heated protests.

She favors moving the monument but said older members of her board and community disagreed.

“It is so generational,” she said. “People 35 and younger grew up in a more multicultural area, so I think there are times when younger people have a lesson to give older people.”

In Manassas, where Mr. Iyer’s restaurant does brisk lunch business, schools and car dealerships incorporate the word “battlefield,” a reflection that the area’s tourism economy thrives in part by celebrating both sides of Civil War heritage. And yet, at the Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center shopping mall on a recent morning, the majority of morning customers at Starbucks and the Apple store were minorities.

Mr. Trump’s turbulent first nine months as president will also affect the outcome. Many of his policies will excite the voters in rural areas. Mr. Trump has backed Mr. Gillespie via Twitter, though so far he has not campaigned with him.

Mr. Northam’s hopes rest in part on the votes of people like Mr. Iyer.

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

The restaurant has a fermentation room, where leftover wine becomes vinegar, and food trimmings participate in homemade soy sauce. The potato bread is made with a starter of fermented potatoes, though home cooks can skip that part. His recipe also recommends saving the potato skins, which find a purpose in the restaurant, though he realizes that a home cook might not use them.

Mr. Orlando is aggressive about sustainability. He helps run local soup kitchens and has classes for children in the garden. “Chefs have such a voice now,” he said. “For a restaurant to mean something, you have to use your power.” But on a day-to-day basis, it’s about using finely tuned taste buds.

And it turns out that it also helps to have a fine recipe that can travel. About a month ago, I was at the Inn at Dos Brisas, about halfway between Houston and Austin. The dinner menu listed steak tartare with fermented potato flatbread. “No way,” I thought, but I asked whether the chef had ever worked in Copenhagen. Indeed, Matt Padilla, the executive chef, had done a stint at Noma when Mr. Orlando was there, and dined at Amass two years ago.

His version of the bread was smaller than the one served at Amass but conveyed the same flaky, buttery, lightly soured character with telltale grill marks. “It’s a great foil for the beef in the tartare,” Mr. Padilla said.

Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.

We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation’s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin — and the reader — have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel’s narrative like one of Trent Reznor’s dark guitar chords: “Wasn’t this what was happening everywhere? A new hyperskepticism, everything politicized, facts tossed out as partisan and any faith in humanity with it.”

“We can see that the pace of media, the onslaught of conflict-centric communications, stokes the flames of hostility.”

“Instead of even trying to figure out what was right, people buried themselves in their devices. People talked to you while looking at their phones, lost in entirely different realities.”

A description of Google’s influence sounds indistinguishable from the mysterious infectious diseases Dr. Martin treats: “It was insinuated in every facet of people’s lives, from work and driving, music, television, every form of communications.” From there the true culprit comes into focus. Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there’s nothing to be done about it. It’s an illness we all have, and there is no cure. Most of us don’t even know that we’re sick.

A similar widespread villainy lies at the heart of David Ignatius’s THE QUANTUM SPY (Norton, $25.95), a somber espionage procedural about the race to build the world’s first quantum computer — a theoretical frontier at the intersection of computer science and quantum physics. Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist who has long covered the C.I.A., and he happily takes us for a jaunt through a world of anonymous hotel rooms and conference tables across Beijing and Vancouver and Dubai, where decisions to take someone off “the shelf” (i.e., bring him or her back into action) are blankly relayed and executed. American start-ups on the brink of game-changing innovation are visited by a C.I.A. officer, a “lean, putty-faced man with a bad haircut” who quietly demands for the United States government to be their only client.

Here, the ostensible enemy is a mole inside the C.I.A. known as Rukou, or the Doorway, whom the C.I.A. must ferret out and eliminate, all the while keeping the Chinese away from their technological breakthroughs — a Sisyphean exercise if ever there was one.

The mood is mournful and restrained. The C.I.A.’s vibe feels like a highway motel with thin walls, a smell of chlorine, a vending machine where your Twix gets stuck on the glass. The most delightful aspect of the book is the characterization of the Chinese — their expletive-ridden insults, downbeat perspective (“Bad luck is always hiding inside the doorway, down the next hutong”), and quirks. Chinese agents carry a mijian with them at all times, “a small, leatherbound diary” in which they write things “that were never, ever to be shared.” In one fascinating scene set in Mexico, a Chinese agent with a Spanish accent unnerves the Chinese-American hero, Harris Chang, by unveiling Chang’s own secret political Chinese ancestry to him. It proves to be a surprisingly powerful interrogation technique: “He was uncomfortable. It was as if someone else had taken possession of his life story.”

It comes to light that the mole is motivated by a desire to build “one world” — a single borderless country that brings to mind Facebook’s hope to “bring the world closer together.” But infinitely more devastating than any double agent is the operating hollowness at the heart of the C.I.A. When superiors question Chang’s loyalty, he submits to three polygraphs; however no lie detector can resolve the problem. Neither innocent nor guilty, he is afflicted by a lack of resolve: “He occupied a space where things are ambiguous, where people are simultaneously friend and foe, loyal and disloyal, impossible to define until the moment when events intervene and force each particle, each heart, to one side or the other.” The agent is a spinning electron in the atom, eluding capture by a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is the probability of an exact location, which holds true only during the nanosecond of perception. Then he is at large again, careening around a moral fog.

In Michelle Richmond’s THE MARRIAGE PACT (Bantam, $27), a different kind of evil is in play, this one just as intangible and pernicious. Giddy and in love, two Bay Area newlyweds, Alice and Jake, receive a Molotov cocktail of a wedding present: an invitation to join “The Pact,” a hush-hush society-cum-cult, the details of which are pitched to them “Glengarry Glen Ross”-style by Vivian, a beautiful woman in a yellow dress with a politician’s pivot and spin.

The Pact is a “fellowship of like-minded individuals” dedicated to ensuring the survival of that exotic, captive animal known as your marriage. It was founded by an Irish woman named Orla who, sequestered on a remote island, wrote a step-by-step system for matrimony, one that is “highly effective, scientifically based.” Pact members will act unilaterally to keep you and your spouse together and happy, no matter what.

Few couples of sound mind would agree to such a proposal, particularly one that requires signing a contract filled with an “impenetrable veil of doublespeak and legalese.” But Alice and Jake — apparently ascribing to the Trumpian life philosophy, “Shoot first and ask questions later” — agree to Vivian’s terms. They soon find themselves marooned in the guest houses of Pact members, following dinner parties replete with “an impressively large stack of profiteroles,” where they chat with women who say things like: “Stupid mushrooms. Just when I had the yard looking so perfect, they popped up today.”

Jake is pulled aside by another Pact member, an old college flame named JoAnne who is paranoid and skittish. She gets down to brass tacks: “I would’ve stopped it, Jake. I could’ve saved you. Now it’s too late.”

It’s a fun, can’t-stop-eating-the-potato-chips kind of premise. Jake — a marriage counselor who has little insight into his own relationships — descends into a labyrinth of paranoia and isolation as he investigates the truth behind The Pact, all the while lying to his wife and enduring one level of punishment after the next. (Apparently, when it comes to marital harmony, de Sade was really on to something.) The book is at its strongest when Richmond describes The Pact’s manual in a wickedly deadpan style. It sounds like something between a tutorial for new guards on Rikers Island and MarriageTM by the Mad Hatter: “Failure to provide three or more gifts in a single calendar year should be treated as a Class 5 Felony.” Then there is the Focus Mechanism, one of a range of contraptions designed to help you stay attentive to your significant other (QVC, take note): “The collar circles her neck, extending all the way up to her jawline, where it cups her chin.”

As Jake gets shadowed by unmarked black Lexus S.U.V.s, receives mysterious packages and wakes up dazed aboard a Cessna with dried blood on his head, it becomes clear that the force of evil is only a matter of perspective. Like back at the C.I.A., there really are no good guys or bad guys here, only floundering players.

In Christopher Swann’s first novel, SHADOW OF THE LIONS (Algonquin, $26.95), we are whisked into another type of cult: Blackburne, an elite all-boys private school in the Virginia countryside, rife with its own odd rituals and unspoken understandings. “A warning shake of the head meant Watch out.” “Cutting your eyes away from a classmate you passed in the hall could be as cruel as sneering in his face.”

Our protagonist is Matthias Glass — a washed-up writer who, after a well-received debut novel and a stint around New York’s literary scene with a “long-legged, pouty” model (Swann has taken some liberties), returns to the prep school of his youth to solve a mystery that has dogged him since graduation. One night, after an argument, his best friend Fritz Davenport, old-money scion and golden boy, ran away from Matthias in the woods — and “off the edge of the earth.” He was never seen again.

Swann takes his time setting up this mystery, with Matthias chasing down forgotten clues and overlooked conversations while being tested by the boys who sit in his class “in a sort of numb acceptance, as if they were on Novocain.” Swann does a wonderful job depicting these lost boys, the puzzling kinetics of friendship, competition and status, all of which feels out of date and menacing — the desire to “conquer girls with all the rough ease of a 007,” or how being labeled gay constituted “the worst, most devastating blow” that left the accused “cast into the outer darkness.”

Blackburne feels like an unmanned ship where anything could happen. Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless. He recalls Hamlet’s letter to Ophelia as detailing a reality where everything should be questioned and nothing is true: “Doubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move, / Doubt truth to be a liar, / But never doubt I love.” It’s the same moral haze Harris Chang and the other heroes got lost in, the only difference being a momentary comfort found in friendship.

Danya Kukafka’s bewitching first novel, GIRL IN SNOW (Simon & Schuster, $26), spins a spell of mournful confession around a “Twin Peaks”-like centerpiece, the beautiful girl found dead: “Lucinda Hayes broke her neck. Cracked it on the edge of the carousel.” The truth is revealed through the claustrophobic confessions of three misfits, observations Kukafka gently takes out and holds up to the light as if sifting through a refuse-filled gutter after a rain. There is Russ, the restrained police officer investigating Lucinda’s murder; Jade, a resentful fellow classmate who makes sense of people and events by stuffing them into the skeletal format of a screenplay; and Cameron, the obsessive loner who stalked Lucinda: “Cameron had started playing Statue Nights when he was 12 years old.” In Kukafka’s capable hands, villainy turns out to be everywhere and nowhere, a DNA that could be found under the fingernails of everybody’s hands.

In THE MURDERS OF MOLLY SOUTHBOURNE (Tor/Forge, paper, $11.99), a scold’s bridle of a coming-of-age tale by Tade Thompson, we meet the protagonist of the title agonizing in her “universe defined by pain.” Every time Molly bleeds, the blood gives birth to a dimwitted, monstrous version of herself, a ghoulish other “molly” who, after a period of incubation, blasts out of doors and from under the bed, bloodthirsty and dangerous. Molly must kill these doppelgängers before they kill her. And thus unspools a horrifying childhood. She learns to murder and dispose of human flesh with the precision of a Tarantino fixer (“When her parents arrive she is lying on a pile of corpses she’d been trying to clean”), all the while enjoying the ABCs of adolescence: first kisses, running away from home, Rudyard Kipling.

The most compelling aspects of the book are not just Thompson’s dagger prose (“In these teenage years she kills three mollys a week, sometimes as many as one a day”), but also the blunt paragraphs and truncated chapters through which he reveals Molly’s reality. It has the effect of a slide show in Art History 101. In darkness, we are shown a series of close-ups: gnarled hand, decapitated head, a foot, some blood, fragments that make little sense until the final portrait is revealed. It’s as unsettling as one of Francis Bacon’s screaming popes, or the Lucian Freud painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping”: a bold outpouring of flesh and crisis at once horrifying and familiar.

Molly with the capital M is the narrator, the original, true Molly, and Thompson does an excellent job dangling questions of authenticity and judgment before us like meat scraps before caged dogs. Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.

The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily — slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted détente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.

We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it’s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all. If villains are a litmus test for our collective mental state, the prognosis isn’t good. It seems these days we’re not only uncertain of everything and everyone — foreigners, friends, institutions, experts, the people in our beds, the thoughts in our heads — we’re also feeling too dazed to do anything about it. If this is the new, all-inclusive, everywhere darkness for 2017, where can evil go in 2018, and beyond?

Maybe Cormac McCarthy was right when he wrote, “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”

So, pass the matches. It’s going to be a long night.","Our Villains, Ourselves: A Thriller Roundup",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/books/review/matt-richtel-dead-on-arrival-new-thriller-fiction.html

As a result, perhaps, Crozes-Hermitage became known both for easygoing, modestly interesting wines as well as for bottles in which flashy expressions of the winemaker’s hand, like flavors of new oak, were more evident than characteristics of the place.

But the wines we drank were far more interesting than what was once commonplace. As always, I suggested three examples, to be consumed with food and company in a relaxed setting. The three Crozes-Hermitages were: Equinoxe Equis 2015; Alain Graillot 2015; and J.L. Chave Sélection Silène 2015.

The Equinoxe — made by Maxime Graillot, the son of Alain Graillot — was a joy to drink. Ripe, fruity and savory, with flavors of black olives, pepper and roasted meats, it showed many of the characteristics I love about syrah wines from the northern Rhône. But that was about the extent of it.

I would categorize it as a wine that expresses the characteristics of the grape more than the place itself. Its character helps to locate it within that general region, but it lacked the nuances that might have allowed an experienced Rhône drinker to pin it down to a more particular place.

This is an observation more than a criticism. As I said, I found the wine to be delicious, a great pleasure to drink and a good value at $21. As we found when drinking vins de soifs in June, sometimes delicious is enough.

Alain Graillot’s Crozes offers similar flavors. It, too, is delicious, with flavors of roasted meats, black peppers and olives. But where the Equinoxe was soft, easy and exuberant, the Graillot was smoothly structured. It was also floral and starkly mineral, with earthy, stony elements. I found the wine lovely, compelling and thoughtful. It’s also $35 rather than $21.

This is a wine that for me most definitely speaks of a place. It doesn’t have the elegance and persistence of Côte-Rôtie or the power of Hermitage, but that helps to let you know it is not from one of the elite terroirs of the region. That is not a knock; it is only rarely an occasion worthy of one of those wines, which to me makes everyday bottles all the more important.

I found it fascinating to compare these two wines, which most likely were overseen by the same man, Maxime Graillot, who has taken over some of the winemaking duties at his father’s estate. Yet the grapes come from different places and the winemaking techniques are different. Most notably, the grapes for the Equinoxe were destemmed before fermentation, while the grapes for the Graillot were not.

This decision seems to have particular cultural significance in the northern Rhône, where the question of whether to destem can shape the character of a wine in a less subtle way than in, say, Burgundy.

Destemming is a more modern technique, as it depends on the technology for automating the destemming process, which otherwise would be laborious. It tends to enhance the fruitiness of the wine. Fermenting the wine with the stems tends to produce more savory elements as well as more tannins, for a more structured wine.

The decision of whether to destem is often a philosophical choice, but it can be a practical one as well. I once asked Bernard Faurie, who makes excellent, traditional Hermitage, why he chose not to destem his grapes.

“God made grapes with stems for a reason,” he said. “It gives the wine long life and energy. Besides, I didn’t want to pay for a destemming machine.”

The grapes for the Alain Graillot come from his vineyard on the plain in Crozes-Hermitage, near the hamlet of Les Chênes Verts. Ordinarily, I would imagine the grapes from this area have less potential than those from the few granite hillside vineyards in Crozes-Hermitage. But the vineyard — unusually for the region, Mr. Graillot once told me — is set in an stony, sandy ancient riverbed, which perhaps adds to the character of the grapes.

The Equinoxe is Maxime Graillot’s négociant line of wines, meaning he buys the grapes. They come from vineyards near the Graillot family estate, from the commune of Beaumont-Monteux, and I believe the soils are somewhat similar. The main differences seem to be the destemming, and the intent to make an easy-drinking wine rather than a wine that ought to age and improve for a decade.

By contrast, half of the grapes for the Chave Silène are from estate vineyards — on a granite slope behind the great hill of Hermitage — and the other half are purchased. The wine tasted richer and riper than the other two, and at 14 percent, it was a percentage point higher in alcohol. The Silène was juicy like the Equinoxe, but as full of minerality as the Graillot, with equally fine tannins. The wine was floral but also with a touch of chocolate and not so much of the olive, roasted-meat flavors.

For me, the Silène occupied a middle ground between the two other wines. It had that extra dimension of place that set it apart from the easygoing Equinoxe, but not to the extent of the Graillot. Nonetheless, I would still consider it a wine of place.

I was happy with each of these three wines, and pleased that they each showed a different face of a region that should not be reflexively maligned. Like St.-Joseph, its stablemate in the category of midprice northern Rhônes, Crozes-Hermitage can outperform expectations. If it does not quite have the potential of St.-Joseph to truly excel, it certainly can rise to the occasion of solid, pleasurable wines of place.

I asked readers who might have remembered drinking St.-Josephs in early 2015 how these Crozes-Hermitages compared. Martin Schappeit of Forest, Va., said the St.-Josephs were more structured and complex. Joseph of Île de France echoed the sentiment, saying they were not as thrilling. George Erdle of Charlotte, N.C., simply stated that Crozes-Hermitage was “vastly different” from St.-Joseph.

Each of these Crozes producers also makes an equivalent bottling of St.-Joseph, and it would be illuminating to make some fresh comparisons. Extra credit, anybody?

Not surprisingly, some readers had different opinions about these wines than my own. VSB of San Francisco seemed to like the Alain Graillot, but called it “port-like,” and found a lingering hot, astringent quality. Dan Barron of New York found the Equinoxe too sour, although he found the Silène complex and juicy.

Martina Zuccarello of New York, on the other hand, saw the Graillot as I did. “The wine was buzzing, not of youth but of life and place,” she said. “It is really a sensational quality that takes this wine from the ordinary to the extraordinary.”

Not every wine has that extra dimension, and plenty of wines that do not can be satisfying. But finding a wine that speaks so directly to you is the great reward of exploration.

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned her, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, who Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly enraged child advocates. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

The United States is in the throes of a great debate: Do we want — can we afford — to remain a safe haven for people who, unlike economic migrants, come here running for their lives? This year the administration slashed the number of refugees the United States will allow by more than half.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s whom we are turning our backs on first.

Ms. Gonzalez is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by the police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state fees. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she said, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who wakes up screaming with nightmares and crawls into bed with her — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Ms. Gonzalez is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Ms. Gonzalez and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress get rid of a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers — they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent, a remedy that has been the most successful path for these children to get legal status.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian be allowed to spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes in the United States as the authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a Border Patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that Border Patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have identified hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that Border Patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration curtailed a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. When that policy change was made, some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the addresses and names of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

Amid all this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, said Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally.

But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are appearing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

But his powerful voice is still one that binds this nation as it struggles with tensions between the Catalan independence movement and the Spanish state, which threatened to remove the region’s separatist government and initiate a process of direct rule by the central government in Madrid.

In August, the poet’s verses offered a measure of comfort after the deadly van attack along the Ramblas, the heart of Barcelona. Over booming loudspeakers, thousands of antiterrorism protesters listened to a recital of García Lorca’s tribute to his favorite thoroughfare: “The street where all four seasons live together. The only street I wish would never end.”

When he was 18, he set off from Granada in 1917 on the first of four expeditions by steam train with his art history professor and other students to tour Andalusia. It was then, he said, that “I became fully aware of myself as a Spaniard.” He was seeking memories of “the ancient souls who once walked the solitary squares we now tread.”

My love of García Lorca extends to all his writing that explores the rural tragedies of women in Andalusia and an earthy culture where death and love are deeply intertwined. I had never expected to visit his house in Granada, where the poet wrote his trilogy of greatest plays — “Blood Wedding,” “Yerma,” and “The House of Bernarda Alba.”

But a reporting assignment took me to the city one day, and I met his niece, Laura García Lorca, in his family home, Huerta de San Vicente, now a museum and whitewashed sanctuary, which is surrounded by linden trees and roses.

The downstairs living room was dark and smelled faintly of jasmine. It was furnished with black and white photos from many decades ago, along with García Lorca’s baby grand piano and a pensive portrait of the writer, with dark wavy hair and sharp eyes, wearing a mustard robe.

His niece led me upstairs to his bedroom and study, furnished with a single bed and an oak desk stained with ink. And there we paused, the memories in this silent house so profound that her tears still flow. “The story is very present,” she said. “We share this as our loss.”

It was soon after that I decided to chase the spirit of this fractured nation through García Lorca’s literary inspirations in southern Spain. I began my first journey with a 10-day road trip with my husband, Omer, through Andalusia in a rented Fiat, hurtling on a smooth stretch of highway through golden hills and olive groves and white villages and ancient Arab fortresses.

We toured Granada, the poet’s hometown, where liberal and conservative political divisions still simmer in a lingering fight over control of García Lorca’s vast archives. In the meantime, the literary treasure has not yet moved from Madrid to a soaring new cultural center built to house it. But public authorities and the writer’s family are close to settling their differences and the archives are expected to arrive within months at the center by the tranquil Plaza de Romanillo.

Before his death, García Lorca alienated the local society by complaining that Granada was inhabited by a cold, introverted ruling class. Yet, despite the mutual loathing, he held court here in the 1920s with his young literary circle of intellectuals, “El Rinconcillo.” At a restaurant known then as Cafe Alameda, he would read his works aloud from the same corner table.

Photo

Today his refuge is named Chikito, and the restaurant’s cuisine is typically Andalusian with a popular tapa of tiny snails with ham and almond sauce and its specialty, an oxtail stew. In 2015, the writer’s favorite corner was transformed into a shrine with a life-size bronze statue of García Lorca seated at a vintage marble table in a dapper bow tie.

The most touching tribute, though, is spontaneous — an annual midnight-to-dawn flamenco tribute every Aug. 19 on the anniversary of García Lorca’s death that is an open secret among performers and locals.

It takes place in the hills northeast of Granada in El Barranco de Viznar but it received little public attention on the 80th anniversary of his death a year ago near the likely mass graves.

In the balmy darkness, trembling voices rose from the forest to the sound of cante jondo or deep song — music that inspired the poetry of García Lorca, who was a musician himself. He likened its rhythms and wavering stammers to the trilling of birds and the music of forest and fountain. And he believed it had to be preserved because it represented the ancient music of the persecuted and oppressed of Andalusia — Arabs, Jews and Gypsies — who fled into the mountains in the 15th century to escape the Spanish Inquisition.

Photo

For the writer, other cities like Seville offered more openness and tolerance — something he considered a reflection of physical geography and the Guadalquivir River that flows within the city and outward to the Atlantic Ocean, shooting through, he wrote in a poem, like “a constant arrow.”

We traveled to Seville, where we sampled a boat trip along the olive-colored Guadalquivir for about a $20 ticket. But the hourlong ride seemed more languid than García Lorca’s dynamic description and the riverside more neglected. The highlights on the trip centered on passing under bridges, the oldest Triana or Isabel II rebuilt by engineers for Gustave Eiffel.

Instead we found more of the city’s essential soul or spirit of “duende” in the sprawling San Fernando municipal cemetery. At its entrance is an exotic neighborhood of tombs and shrines devoted to the city’s Andalusian aristocracy — flamenco stars and fallen bullfighters such as Francisco Rivera Pérez “Paquirri,” who is sculpted in a matador’s suit and poised to guide a bull’s final attack.

It was in Seville that García Lorca befriended Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, a bullfighter who was also a poet and a playwright. After Ignacio was gored in a post-retirement bullfight in 1934, García Lorca wrote his classic elegy in tribute to him, a 1935 poem of disbelief and grief about his death at 43.

Photo

There is no more affecting place to read aloud his lament — “Oh white wall of Spain! Oh black bull of sorrow! Oh hard blood of Ignacio!” — than beside the matador’s simple grave. It lies in the shadow of an enormous tomb for his fellow bullfighter and brother-in-law, Joselito, who was killed in 1920 by a bull named Bailaor. That marble and bronze sculpture depicts Joselito in his draped coffin, shouldered by 18 distraught men and women. One of the figures is Ignacio, head cast to beseech the cloudless skies.

Death, honor and frustration are themes that endlessly fascinated García Lorca. In 1933, he staged the premier of “Blood Wedding” in Madrid, drawing on 1928 newspaper accounts of a defiant bride, Francisca Cañadas, who abandoned her fiancé — her sister’s brother-in-law — to flee hours before a pending marriage deep into the countryside with her beloved first cousin.

Her sister and her husband tracked them down, fatally shooting the cousin and strangling Francisca, leaving her for dead on the road to Nijar. The bride survived, living for decades with the enmity of her village who blamed her for provoking the tragedy.

In his drama, García Lorca transformed the key characters and heightened the bloodshed. He conceived of the set inside a spacious cave like the ancient enclaves in Purullena and Guadix, southern towns in the province of Granada known for mazes of whitewashed caves fashioned into homes and with inhabitants called trogloditas. He was struck by the rare accommodation of life and earth in the labyrinth of cave dwellings — some that date back to the 16th century.

Photo

We had stayed a few years earlier in a rented cave in Purullena, which is also known for its cobalt blue ceramics made with a special polychrome technique that dates to the 16th century. The cave was a cool refuge on hot August nights and so profoundly silent that sleep transformed to nights of intensely vivid dreams. On this trip, we returned again to explore the caves in Guadix and Purullena, some thoroughly modern with wrought iron guard gates, chimneys, marble floors, Wi-Fi access and television antennas poking out of the oatmeal colored hills. Others were gothic ruins from past centuries, poetry in white against the blue splendor of skies.

On a back road in a cave neighborhood in Purullena, a silver haired woman in a black coat and cane noticed us photographing the homes. She beckoned us inside her cave with a red tiled awning and arched door.

Her kindness reminded me of another basic element of Andalusia that García Lorca cherished — its people. On the same day that she spoke to us, we stopped nearby in Graena, a small town that is home to spring-fed thermal baths and an outdoor barbecue restaurant, Bar La Pradera, which specializes in lamb chops and steak grilled on hot coals. We had not dined there in five years, and tourists rarely stop there, at the terrace across from an open-air municipal pool and garden. But the owners welcomed us back with kisses and then they invited us to their home.

No journey like this could be complete without witnessing the last act of “Blood Wedding.” We rumbled along a dirt road to reach the Cortijo del Fraile, the crumbling farmhouse where Francisca Cañadas lived with her father who owned the property then. Today, it is a surreal landmark of ruin and romance in Europe’s only semidesert, the Cabo de Gata Nature Preserve in Almería, Spain’s southeastern corner.

The fragile farmhouse is surrounded by a wire fence to prevent entry of tourists. Its facade has been minimally restored but there is much more work to be done. A plain marker took note of its literary pedigree — and also its star turn as a backdrop in various movies, among them, Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.”

From the ruins, we headed toward the town of Nijar and stopped at one of its oldest municipal cemeteries. Its white walls were full with rose and blue silk flowers and tribute plaques to the village’s dead, including members of the star-crossed Cañadas family.

Every time I visit Andalusia, I try to find some trace of the grave of the runaway bride. She never married and was essentially buried in life by the scorn of her village. And every year nothing changes in the essential rural tragedy imagined by García Lorca.

A lone cemetery worker offered me a vague hint that Francisca Cañadas’s tomb is placed near a soaring cypress tree, a symbol of mourning and hope. But a stone plaque was nowhere to be found. According to the family’s wishes, the worker said, it is marked with a false name.",Chasing the Spirit of a Fractured Spain Through García Lorca,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/travel/andalusia-federico-garcia-lorca-spain.html

These situations tend to happen in neighborhoods undergoing rapid gentrification where the rents are rising fast and landlords see a way to squeeze more money out of a space.

In 2016, the city’s Department of Buildings received 18,844 complaints about potentially illegal conversions in the city. If an inspector finds tenants living in an illegal apartment in dangerous conditions, for example, if the apartment does not have adequate fire safety measures, a vacate order could force tenants out. However, in most cases, an inspector will issue the building owner a violation with a court summons, ordering the owner to correct the problem. Tenants living in such apartments may be able to withhold rent.

Over the past year, William J. Gribben, a tenant lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan law firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue and Joseph, has noticed a spike in calls to his office from tenants complaining about illegal apartments. Most of the calls come from tenants who have rented out a single bedroom in a larger apartment.

With strangers living together, bedroom doors often have deadbolt locks, a violation of city occupancy and fire rules. The arrangement may also create a de facto single room occupancy hotel, which would likely violate the city housing maintenance code. “It’s dangerous for tenants,” Mr. Gribben said of a phenomenon that he said “has snowballed.”

Some apartments, like the one where I lived, raise red flags from the moment you step inside. But other illegal arrangements are harder to spot. Paint the walls, add a kitchen and a bathroom to the fourth floor of a three-family townhouse, and who would ever know that the certificate of occupancy limits the number of legal apartments to three, not four?

That’s what happened to Mr. Hassan, a marketing manager who moved to New York from Denver in May 2016. He found the Bedford-Stuyvesant studio listed on Craigslist for $1,350 a month. Located on the top floor of a brownstone, the apartment looked ordinary. “When I signed the lease, there was nothing in there that said, ‘This is not a rentable unit,’” said Mr. Hassan, 51.

But in July 2017, the city’s Department of Buildings posted a notice at the entrance to the building alerting tenants to a complaint about an illegal unit. Mr. Hassan was baffled. His apartment had polished wood floors, full-size windows and a renovated bathroom. The kitchen, however, lacked a stove, a detail that might have given another renter pause. But Mr. Hassan’s apartment in Denver did not have a stove either, so he did not find the setup unusual.

Mr. Hassan’s landlord, Kwabena Charles, explained to Mr. Hassan that the building’s certificate of occupancy only permitted three rentable units. In order to pass a buildings department inspection, Mr. Hassan would have to pack up his possessions and remove his name from the door to the building. Mr. Hassan doubted the plausibility of the scheme. Even without clothes, books and photographs, “The moment you walk in, you know this is a habitable unit,” Mr. Hassan said.

Mr. Hassan also worried about what would happen if he erased all evidence of his residency. Without a lease or his name on the door, how could he prove that he lived in the apartment if, say, he came home to find his belongings missing?

Illegal apartments “hurt the tenants who get involved,” Mr. Gribben said.

In a rambling conversation that Mr. Hassan recorded and later shared with me, Mr. Charles blamed Mr. Hassan for creating a fire hazard because he kept too many possessions in his apartment. He also said that if a fire were to start in Mr. Hassan’s apartment, “the whole building goes up in flames, everybody dies.”

Yet Mr. Charles did not want Mr. Hassan to vacate the space. Instead, he told him to purge his belongings and help mislead the inspectors. “How to get rid of an inspector is to overdo it or to dumb it down so they’re not smart enough” to realize that anyone lives in the space, Mr. Charles explained on the tape. “I could do anything. This could be my clubhouse,” he said of the fourth-floor space.

But after inspectors visited the building twice but failed to get into the apartment, the Department of Buildings closed the investigation. The buildings department typically closes investigations after two unsuccessful inspection attempts. A new complaint would trigger a new investigation.

In late September, Mr. Hassan left and moved into a two-month sublet elsewhere in Brooklyn. “Things were not improving,” Mr. Hassan said. “I just wanted to get away.”

In early October, the apartment was listed for $1,500 a month on Craigslist as a “charming studio.” Mr. Charles said to me, “I haven’t violated anything.” He explained that even though the building is zoned as a three-family home, he could rent out the fourth unit because it had a hot plate instead of a stove. Without a complete kitchen, “there’s nothing wrong with it.” But according to the city buildings department, the fourth floor attic of a three-family home must remain unoccupied, even without a stove.

By mid-October, the listing had been removed from Craigslist. Mr. Charles declined to say whether the apartment had been rented — or if a new tenant knew that the space might be illegal.",Could You Be Living in an Illegal Apartment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/could-you-be-living-in-an-illegal-apartment.html

But in the Gourma, risks to the brigade are constant, and missions have turned deadly. In August, the brigade’s radio operator was killed when part of the team responded to protect a United Nations camp in Douentza, Mali, from a raid by armed men that also claimed the life of a peacekeeper, according to officials.

In September, an ambush by unknown assailants who used a roadside bomb and gunfire to attack the brigade’s convoy injured three.

On a routine operation last month, a reporter joined the brigade as it drove to a remote village to follow up on a tip that two elephants had been killed.

The convoy bounced over a road riddled with potholes, past remains of burned-out trucks, through a sandstorm and rain, and then into fields of sucking mud and soft dunes.

After arriving in the village, representatives from the brigade met with local leaders to share information about elephants, while the brigade’s men socialized with the villagers and bought chickens for later meals.

No one had heard anything about any elephant deaths, and the tip was dismissed.

While the brigade has successfully prevented poaching since February, officials worry ivory traffickers are merely waiting for an opportunity to resume operations. Putting a permanent dent in poaching will take arrests and convictions that break apart ivory trafficking networks for good, experts said.

“The whole law enforcement pathway, from intelligence in the beginning to conviction in the end, needs to be looked at,” said Chris Thouless, a strategic adviser at Save the Elephants.

It will not be easy. The ivory trafficking networks are vast and complex, extending far beyond Mali’s borders.

Butterfly,” our not-so-bright Gallimard — a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s — falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag. That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes. (Check out the priceless “Forbidden Broadway” parody of the show.)

In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman. He’s a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman. Got that? Never mind. We’ll get back to it later.

This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler). But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?) within less than three hours of stage time, it’s a lot to assimilate.

There is another, even more distracting problem. Once we’ve seen Mr. Ha — who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw — in boy’s clothes early on (that’s when he says he’s a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), it’s impossible to unsee him as that boy. Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.

You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism. Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.

But more important to the play’s intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly,” Gallimard’s favorite opera. Such, it seems, is the West’s vision of the East.

Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimard’s dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East. That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States. Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about France’s involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving “big guns, big industry, big … well, you know your own fantasies.”

But for “M. Butterfly” to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy. In this version, you always maintain the distance — sometimes amused, sometimes appalled — that’s generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.

Don’t blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film). Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking person’s hunk (“Children of Men,” “The Knick”), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.

The show’s broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera. As Mr. Owen’s Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.

If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes. Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.

Mr. Ha’s arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard. Building up the role of Song’s shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake. Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimard’s wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.

Most disappointing for Ms. Taymor’s fans is the production’s lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to “The Lion King” and her more recent “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady. (Paul Steinberg did the sets.)

The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of “Miss Saigon.” And Elliot Goldenthal’s “original music and soundscapes” are usually more intrusive than evocative.

Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant. Anyone doubting that Gallimard’s pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.

But even if the romance at the heart of “M. Butterfly” is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation. In this incarnation, we’re not being seduced, but preached at.

One unlikely winner among the smaller parties was the former prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s newly formed Center Party. His dark-horse campaign led his populist outfit to secure seven seats.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson won more than 10 percent of the vote, deploying his eccentric charisma to good effect and campaigning on a platform that promised to squeeze the banks and divvy up the proceeds for nationwide infrastructure.

“Gunnlaugsson’s politics follow the general trend we have seen lately in Western democracies towards anti-elitism, simplistic solutions and forms of nationalism,” said Jon Ormur Halldorsson, a political scientist at Reykjavik University.

The former prime minister was forced out of the government last year after the leaked Panama Papers revealed that Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s family had offshore holdings in the British Virgin Islands, setting off widespread protests over his perceived tax avoidance.

The scandal led to the collapse of the government and to early elections.

It was a different reality from last year’s election results for the Pirates, a ragtag group of futurists, anarchists and hackers.

Opinion polls had predicted that the environmentalist Left-Green Movement, a pacifist group that opposes Iceland’s membership in NATO, might emerge as the largest party and that its popular and charismatic leader, Katrin Jakobsdottir, would become the country’s fourth prime minister in two years.

But the polls were off the mark. The party, which had vowed to adopt a new constitution partly crowdsourced via social media, gained one seat to emerge with 11 — well short of expectations.

Such a mixed result opens up a kaleidoscope of coalition possibilities. Eight parties have entered the Althing in this election. After last year’s vote, it took months for a coalition to be brokered.

Mr. Halldorsson said that coalition talks might not play out so favorably for Mr. Gunnlaugsson despite his ambitions to become a kingmaker.

He is “an isolated figure,” Mr. Halldorsson said, one who “very few would relish working with.”

A more likely coalition partner, observers say, is the revived Social Democratic Party, a former establishment mainstay that had been badly punished in previous elections, and that has returned from electoral oblivion with seven seats. The party now shares the position of third-largest party with Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s Center Party.

In this small volcanic island of 340,000, where voter turnout is generally high, the participation this year stood at a little over 81 percent.

One newcomer, the anti-immigrant People’s Party, defied the polls to get its first foothold in the Althing with four seats.

Iceland has seen voter dissatisfaction surge in the face of multiple scandals.

One of his administration’s partners, Bright Future, quit the coalition. The government had been formed a mere 10 months before, born of early elections called after Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s abrupt resignation.

One bright spot: The country has managed to recover from the brutal aftermath of the global financial collapse of 2008. But the political landscape is fraught with scandals.

Mr. Halldorsson, the political scientist, said, “Although the economy has fully recovered, the political crisis set in motion by the economic collapse in 2008 continues to deepen.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

Mike Noble, a Republican pollster, called it “bedlam out here in Arizona.”

“Everyone’s phones are blowing up,” he said. “This is essentially a free-for-all.”

For Democrats to narrow the Republican hold on the Senate, they will have to take aim at two Republican seats, Mr. Flake’s and Senator Dean Heller’s in Nevada. No other Republican up for re-election next year comes from a generally competitive state.

But while they have talked a big game in Arizona, hoping for a demographic and political shift, so far, Democrats have little to show for their efforts. The party does not hold a single statewide office. In 2012, the last time the state had an open Senate seat, Democrats recruited Richard H. Carmona, a tough-talking Vietnam War hero and former surgeon general in the administration of George W. Bush. Despite Mr. Carmona’s conservative credentials, Mr. Flake won the seat, 49 percent to 46 percent.

Next year could be different. The challenge for Republican Party officials will be to find a candidate who is aligned closely enough with Mr. Trump to appeal to his populist wing of the party — and to beat Ms. Ward in a primary dominated by the hard right — but not so closely that he or she would lose to Ms. Sinema.

The party needs “an acceptable ‘not Kelli’ choice who can surf the policy divides that are besieging our party right now,” said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in Arizona. He and other strategists say they have been inundated with text messages and phone calls since Mr. Flake’s surprise decision to leave the race.

Mr. Flake, who lost support with Trump supporters in Arizona after publishing a book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” that took aim at the president, announced his retirement this past week with a blistering indictment of Mr. Trump and the Republicans who embrace him.

But while he framed his decision as a matter of principle, polling in the state showed just how difficult it would be for an anti-Trump Republican to win an Arizona primary. One recent poll showed Mr. Flake with an 18 percent approval rating, and a survey in August by Arizona High Ground, Mr. Coughlin’s firm, found Mr. Flake trailing both Ms. Ward and Ms. Sinema.

Ms. Ward has the backing of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, who has vowed to wage war on establishment Republicans, chief among them Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Ed Rollins, a veteran strategist who is the co-chairman of Great America, a Trump-aligned political action committee, recently signed on as her campaign manager.

And Robert Mercer, the deep-pocketed New York investor who helped finance Mr. Trump’s campaign, has donated $300,000 to Ms. Ward’s political action committee this year, according to Federal Election Commission records.

But Steven Law, the chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee aligned with Mr. McConnell, vowed that Mr. Bannon and his allies would be the losers.

“Senator Flake’s decision to exit the race gives everyone a chance — the White House and Republicans in Arizona — to work together to find a strong candidate who can hold this seat,” Mr. Law said in an email. “That’s not going to be Kelli Ward.”

Arizona House Republicans met privately in Washington on Thursday morning to discuss who might challenge Ms. Ward. At least one potential candidate, Representative David Schweikert, told reporters last week that he lacked “the burning passion” to run. No consensus was reached on an alternative.

Speculation has centered on State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, an early and enthusiastic Trump backer who was the chief operating officer of the president’s 2016 campaign, and Representative Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and the first American woman to fly in combat.

But it is unclear whether Mr. DeWit is interested. And with Mr. McCain battling brain cancer, party operatives say Ms. McSally — who has long expressed a desire to serve in the Senate — may be betting that his seat will open up, and that she could ascend to the Senate by appointment of the governor.

Ms. McSally has also drawn opposition from a coalition of conservative advocacy groups, led by the Club for Growth. On Friday, the Club for Growth released a letter urging Matt Salmon, a former representative from Arizona, to jump into the race, calling Mr. Salmon “a proven, principled conservative.” Mr. Salmon, who is now the chief lobbyist for Arizona State University, is considering it, a person close to him said.

Whoever wins the Republican primary will almost certainly face Ms. Sinema, who is pitching herself to voters as a consensus builder with a compelling life story: She was homeless as a child, and her family lived for a time in an abandoned gas station.

In a brief interview while taking a break from fund-raising phone calls, the congresswoman described herself as “really committed to finding a bipartisan solution” to the nation’s problems, and said she subscribed to both liberal and conservative values — a philosophy she said had roots in her childhood.

“We got help from both family and my parents’ church, but we also got help from the government,” she said, adding that she believed in “the conservative concept of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and working really hard every day,” and in the liberal notion that “you’ve got to help people in need.”

Ms. Sinema, 41, is also the first openly bisexual member of the House, and has the strong backing of gay rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the powerful Washington advocacy organization, which has vowed to make “significant investments” in Arizona races this year.

But some of her positions have rankled party progressives. Besides her Benghazi vote, she also voted against Representative Nancy Pelosi of California for Democratic leader.

There is “still a lot of resentment” toward Ms. Sinema over her Benghazi vote, said Mr. Grijalva, who added that he would withhold his endorsement until he learned more about how she would vote on issues including tax cuts, immigration and the environment.

“Given how Kyrsten Sinema defines herself in the next few months, she could solidify her position with a real chance to win,” Mr. Grijalva said.

One potential challenger to Ms. Sinema is Mark Kelly, the retired astronaut and husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly wounded in a 2011 massacre in Tucson. This past spring, some grass-roots Democratic groups in Arizona drafted a petition encouraging Mr. Kelly, who now advocates gun safety, to enter the race, and they are said to be renewing that effort.",‘Bedlam Out Here in Arizona’ After Jeff Flake Departs Senate Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/politics/arizona-senate-race-flake-sinema-ward-bannon.html

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance.","As a generation turned, house D.J.s turned remixes of Sade ballads into club classics, and a raft of hip-hop artists repeatedly sampled her.

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Photo

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

Photo

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

A post shared by Izaak Theo (@caracalonbenzos) on Jan 16, 2017 at 11:21am PST

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”",Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/style/sade-sade-sade.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Kaepernick’s lawyer said Saturday that Kaepernick had not received an invitation to the meeting.

“It’s obvious that Colin is being invoked for purposes other than playing football,” the lawyer, Mark Geragos, said in an interview. “Everyone seems to have an agenda other than putting Colin on the football field.”

Officials at the N.F.L. said it was up to the players to invite him. Earlier this week the players union, which is helping coordinate the meeting, did not appear to be sure it would take place and had not firmed up a guest list.

On Saturday, Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Malcolm Jenkins, who has been active in the talks, invited McNair, Commissioner Roger Goodell and Kaepernick to meet in Philadelphia, according to ESPN.

Eric Reid, a safety on the 49ers who knelt with Kaepernick during the anthem last season, and has also participated in talks with the league, was also confused by Jenkins’s invitation because he, too, was unaware of any meeting in Philadelphia.

In the territory of the imagination, the threat of madness is never too far away, a dark cloud hovering.

The clouds that roll through the four novellas in Joe Hill’s STRANGE WEATHER (Morrow, $27.99) are pretty consistently ominous, too, though they mean something different in every story. In “Snapshot,” the fearsome thunderstorm unleashed at the climax seems to stand for the washing away of memories from an Alzheimer’s-afflicted mind. In “Loaded,” the cloud is a thick haze of smoke from a raging forest fire approaching a Florida town — where a psychopathic mall security cop on a killing spree is generating some deadly smoke of his own. “Aloft” (the book’s weakest story) finds its hero, a terrified first-time skydiver, marooned atop a fluffy-looking but curiously solid white cloud. And in the apocalyptic “Rain,” the clouds burst with lethal precipitation, dagger-like crystals that riddle anyone unlucky enough to get caught in the downpour. Hill’s fiction is squarely in the pulp-horror tradition that Matheson helped establish — yarns about extraordinary things happening to ordinary folks — and, unsurprisingly, because he is Stephen King’s son, it’s King’s relentless, hard-charging Matheson that his work most closely resembles. His afterburners have afterburners. All his writing has a headlong, almost manic momentum, which can be a tad wearying in his long novels, but is nicely suited to the hundred-or-so-page narratives in “Strange Weather.” It’s particularly effective in “Loaded,” with its escalating, incomprehensible (and non-supernatural) mayhem.

And when Hill eases up on the gas pedal a little, as he does from time to time in “Snapshot,” he’s even better. That story, about an old woman’s loss of her self and a fat boy’s development of his, lingers now and then over photographs, which are here synonymous with the memories without which a self is functionally impossible. Hill seems to feel that he can relax some in this one, go a bit deeper, because he trusts his metaphor. Just as Matheson always did.

It’s no accident that King’s “pure drive” version of the Matheson legacy is the dominant one in modern horror. I sometimes think that all horror writers are cases of arrested development, stuck forever in the terrors and insecurities of adolescence. (Or is it just the guys?) Most of today’s best practitioners of the genre were teenagers in the 1980s, when Stephen King paperbacks, dark covers beckoning, ruled the mall bookstores, the drugstore racks, the train waiting rooms and the airport departure lounges, waiting for sensation-seeking kids to become their loyal lifelong subjects. Many of Joe Hill’s generation (he was born in 1972) signed up eagerly, and a few turned into writers like Victor LaValle, Paul Tremblay, Gemma Files, John Langan, Laird Barron, Sarah Langan and Stephen Graham Jones.

Benjamin Percy, born in 1979, might have been too young for that party, but on the evidence of his thrilling new novel, THE DARK NET (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26), it seems likely that an older relative somehow sneaked him in. “The Dark Net” is, at least on its crowded surface, one of the best Stephen King novels not written by the master himself. The fate of the world, or at least Portland, Ore., depends on the ability of a motley gang of misfits to head off the eruption of satanic forces from the murkiest recesses of the internet. The devil’s chief opponents are a frazzled newspaper reporter, a former child evangelist now living under an alias, an ageless drug dealer, a homeless man and a 12-year-old girl (the reporter’s niece), blind since the age of 5, who is learning to see again with the aid of a virtual-reality-like headset.

The setup promises furious action, and Percy delivers, like Matheson, like King. But plot isn’t everything in “The Dark Net.” Percy, in a mere 253 pages, finds space, too, for evocative descriptions of urban landscapes, patient development of his characters’ psyches, and thoughtful ruminations on the attractions and the perils of cyberspace. And, because this is a horror novel, he permits himself the occasional light musing on the nature of good and evil. It’s an awfully impressive literary performance.

Obviously, there’s more than a trace of LaValle’s survival-centric, morally curious Matheson in this book, too, but that sort of horror is, in its pure form, much less common. I found it, though, in a few stories in Nadia Bulkin’s striking debut collection, SHE SAID DESTROY (Word Horde, paper, $16.99). Some of her pieces, like “Intertropical Convergence Zone” and “The Five Stages of Grief,” examine political oppression and the terrible choices it imposes. (Bulkin, who grew up in Indonesia during the declining years of the Suharto dictatorship, also holds a degree in political science.) And those are distinctly horror tales of the “What threatens your existence and what will you do to get through?” variety, with a coldly angry 21st-century edge; a couple of the lesser stories are all edge. My favorite piece in “She Said Destroy” is perhaps its quietest, a stunningly original ghost story called “Endless Life,” whose heroine, a hotel maid, haunts the room she died in by accident — which happens to be the same place where a brutal general, known popularly as the Jackal, died by his own hand. The maid’s singular misfortune is that people believe that the resident spirit is that of the Jackal, and check in to enjoy a morbid kick or to mourn their own dead or to hurl abuse at the general’s departed soul, which is farther away than they think. The story, a melancholy wisp, is in the maid’s posthumous reactions to the emotions of the people who pass through the infamous Room 305; through their kinks and grief and rage, Bulkin sketches a deft portrait of a wounded society. And in the dead maid’s shifting responses, the story manages to suggest that in some political environments the tough choices persist beyond the grave.

Every possible Matheson — King’s, LaValle’s and mine, anyway — seems to inhabit the modest quarters of Stephen Graham Jones’s brilliant novella MAPPING THE INTERIOR (Tor, paper, $10.99), whose narrator, a sleepwalking 12-year-old American Indian boy, sees his father’s ghost one night in the tiny modular home (just off the reservation) that he shares with his mother and his little brother. Because he’s a kid, on the cusp of 13, Junior doesn’t have much trouble believing in the ghost. Besides, this is the ghost he wants. “My heart pounded in my chest with what I wanted to call fear,” he says, “but what I now know was actually hope.” As Jones — himself American Indian — knows, hope is a rare commodity in Junior’s community, and the boy embraces it enthusiastically. But as all grown-ups know, hope is also a cruelly mixed blessing; best to be wary. By the end of “Mapping the Interior” Junior, an optimistic but not a stupid boy, has gone through something like the adult process of epistemological suspense: kicking the tires of that notion you’re thinking of believing, then taking it for a spin before you seal the deal.

That’s my Matheson, right there. Jones burdens his young hero with plenty of life-or-death decisions, as LaValle would have it. And he drives the action with a heavy foot on the accelerator, in accordance with King’s decree. How can there be three Richard Mathesons in one slim book? Maybe it’s just my imagination. Or maybe it’s The Twilight Zone.","A Roundup of New Horror, All Indebted to an Early Master",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/books/review/best-of-richard-matheson-new-horror-fiction.html

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html

PITTSBURGH — October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I have breast cancer. The country is fully pinked out in support of breast cancer screening and research, and though I know all the pink is meant to make me feel good, to tell me that the entire country has my back, I actually find it profoundly alienating. Pink is not a serious color, though cancer is a very serious disease. Pink is about femininity; cancer is about staying alive.

I am lucky, if one can say that, within the context of possible cancer diagnoses. My breast cancer is small, has the tumor markers most favorable for treatment (estrogen- and progesterone-positive, HER2-negative) and is very slow-growing. A friend of mine, a doctor, trying to allay his anxiety and mine, joked that based on these results, I didn’t really even have breast cancer.

But breast cancer, even when one has a good prognosis, always raises the possibility of mastectomy, a surgery that removes the patient’s disease but is also said to disfigure her in a way that can compromise her femininity. The question that looms, reinforced by the ubiquitous pink, is whether a woman who has lost her breasts to mastectomy will still be a whole woman.

I have to say, speaking as a breast cancer patient, that the question never crossed my mind. I am not worried about losing my femininity to breast cancer surgery; I’m worried about losing my future to the disease. The real worry with breast cancer is metastasis: spread. And even though my present prognosis is good, there are reasons prophylactic double mastectomy would not be an unreasonable choice for me. However, after genetic testing and an M.R.I., I chose lumpectomy, with radiation, instead of mastectomy. Avoiding major surgery made the most sense in my specific situation; that mastectomy would threaten my womanliness did not factor in.

It’s interesting, that contrast between the frivolousness implied by femininity and the solemnity that marks a diagnosis of cancer. I’m an oncology nurse turned hospice nurse, and though I’ve seen many cancer patients return home to live their lives, I’ve seen more than a few of them die of their disease. It is not an abstraction, nor an exaggeration, to describe cancer as a killer.

And it’s that fear of cancer’s potential deadliness that overwhelmingly preoccupies all the breast cancer patients I’ve heard from since I received my diagnosis in mid-September. A colleague who has had a couple of biopsies since her treatment, but no new disease, wrote eloquently to me about how tai chi and dark chocolate help tamp down her fear that her cancer will return. A friend reminded me that her mother has outlived her diagnosis by over 20 years. And a friend of friends, who chose to have a double mastectomy, spoke of the enormous peace of mind the operation gave her and her sister, who also had breast cancer.

What resonates in each of these stories is two words: I lived. These women survived their cancer and keep on living.

In my own work in oncology, I primarily took care of patients with what we call liquid tumors: leukemia, lymphoma. We say in oncology that bad diseases require bad treatments, meaning savage and harsh, and treatments for acute leukemia are very bad. The chemotherapy causes patients to lose their hair, develop terrible mouth sores, suffer gastrointestinal distress and see their immune systems compromised.

I never, though, had a patient whose worry about those side effects came close to her worry about the disease. Being preoccupied with saving one’s life produces a myopia, in which other worries unrelated to one’s possibly imminent death fall away.

I did ask my husband, “If I lose my breasts, will you love me the same way?” I was half-joking, but the question was also ridiculous because I knew the answer. Knew it: “Yes.” Still. I feel that my asking it resulted from a kind of primordial sexism that, despite my best efforts, continues to infect my thoughts. The association of femininity and breast cancer is pernicious, because it genders the disease, meaning that a diagnosis of breast cancer marks patients as women first, people second. It implies that our womanliness is diseased, not our bodies.

“Be more than pink,” the Susan G. Komen website says, with links to information about supporting breast cancer research. The phrase suggests that pink doesn’t tell the whole story of breast cancer. I would take that statement further, arguing that it insults breast cancer patients to conjoin our femininity and this frightening disease.

My cancer was diagnosed via screening, a callback after my yearly mammogram. The tech finished the follow-up ultrasound, and then the radiologist, after a wait, came in. She stood a long time, saying nothing, and I realized belatedly that her silence resulted from concern. Because then she said, “We see a mass here at 9 o’clock.” I cried in the screening room while the tech held me, as tightly as if I were her own child, and I didn’t fear for some ephemeral sense of girlishness or sexiness, but rather for my life.",Breast Cancer Is Serious.

Often in the past, Jay-Z would end his concerts with an extended musical outro during which he scanned the crowd and shouted out individual fans. It was a way to make an impossibly grand night feel small.

Here, he achieved that effect, though perhaps inadvertently, by different means. He closed his set with “Smile,” one of the most serene productions on his new album. “No drums! No drums!” he told his band, as he began rapping. The mood was mellow, the room was decelerating.

“There is going to be an enormous crush of borrowers who think they are eligible only to find that they are not,” said Seth Frotman, the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which published a report on the subject in June. “We need to get ready for it.”

All Mr. Shafer has been trying to do for more than 25 years is get ready for a career where he could make a difference while also earning enough to buy a home and help raise a family. The son of a fisherman and a mother who eventually became a teacher herself, Mr. Shafer, 46, does indeed own a cozy house on a street with gorgeous foliage. He and his wife live with their two sons, ages 10 and 4.

At work, Mr. Shafer offers job interview advice to one student while plotting financial aid application strategies with another. The classroom where he and his colleagues work has notices on the walls about housing and a free Thanksgiving dinner.

But at home over the last two years, he has spent many hours communicating with his current loan servicer, FedLoan, which is part of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. Eventually, he contacted elected officials and the Department of Education’s ombudsman department. The fact that he has had more than one servicer is a big part of what seems to have gone wrong.

As Mr. Shafer tells it, teacher circles were abuzz back in 2007 when the federal public service loan forgiveness program came into existence. Five years earlier, he had consolidated all of his student loans into a single one. At the time, his servicer verified his income and put him into a repayment plan where his payments would grow slowly over time, presumably as his income grew.

In 2007, Mr. Shafer said, he called his servicer at the time, ACS Education Services, and told the company that he wanted to enroll in the public service loan forgiveness program. No problem, he said he had been told, as long as he made his payments on time for 120 months. When ACS exited the federal loan servicing business, his loan moved to Mohela, short for the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, in 2012. Nothing, he said, that he heard or saw from Mohela gave him pause.

In 2013, he heard this from a fellow teacher: Once borrowers in the public service loan forgiveness program reached 120 payments, only one servicer, FedLoan, could forgive the remaining balance. So Mr. Shafer did what he needed to do to move his loans there.

It was at that point that things began to go off the rails. Remember that repayment program that Mr. Shafer ended up in back in 2002? It is what’s known as a graduated repayment plan, and if you’re in one, you’re not eligible for public service loan forgiveness. He was supposed to be in one of the income-based plans.

All along, Mr. Shafer said, people at the three servicers told him that his loan was in “good status” when he asked whether he was on track for forgiveness in 2017. The phone representatives at these servicers, however, may have been defining that term more narrowly — namely, that he was merely making on-time payments. It’s also possible that they simply didn’t understand the highly specific requirements of the loan forgiveness program.

In 2015, Mr. Shafer received an email from FedLoan that definitively alerted him to the fact that none of his eight years of payments had counted toward forgiveness. He panicked and spent the next year fighting back, flabbergasted that so much time had gone by without any of the three servicers telling him that anything was wrong when he had quite specifically and repeatedly inquired.

So why didn’t they? A spokesman for ACS’s current owner said it could not comment on the concerns of a past borrower, even though Mr. Shafer granted the company permission to do so. A Mohela spokesman said that while it didn’t have specific records of having told Mr. Shafer that his payments were not qualifying, its phone representative’s contact with him in January 2013 was probably what spurred him to move his loans to FedLoan to become eligible for the forgiveness program. Mr. Shafer said that was not so.

At FedLoan, a spokesman said it had told Mr. Shafer that he had a problem, more than once, by phone and through other communications. Indeed, in Mr. Shafer’s pile of documents, I did find a 2014 statement that said, on the back, that he had not made any qualifying payments. Mr. Shafer had missed that, and many others probably did, too, given that FedLoan didn’t bother to put this crucial piece of information on the front of the bill, let alone in 100-point neon “You are doing this wrong” type.

As for FedLoan’s specific assertion that it disclosed the problem to him by phone in 2013, Mr. Shafer responds with the following: Why on earth would he have not jumped on the problem instantly and aggressively if he had heard that in 2013?

There does not appear to be any happy ending in the offing for Mr. Shafer, and after a year of appeals, he did move himself into an eligible repayment plan. If nothing else happens to mess this all up again, he should finish paying off his loans when he is 55, about the time that his first child starts college. That will be 37 years after he took out his first loan as a teenager.

Worried that your story will end with similar bad news? There are four crucial requirements in the public service loan forgiveness program. You have to be in an eligible job, with an eligible loan, making the right kind of payments (which was what tripped Mr. Shafer up) and doing so in the right way. A column I wrote in April outlines the process, even if conquering it proves to be another matter.

Mr. Shafer remains baffled by it all. Perspiring at his dining room table this week after a meal of halibut that he had caught himself, he sipped a second adult beverage and tried to understand what had happened. In what other area of life, he wondered aloud, would you pay your bills on time only to be told that the payments hadn’t counted?

Later on in the week, he put it like so: “They have the power, regardless of my service and full payments, to make me look inept. Though I have been working hard for 18 years to help young people graduate from high school and build a viable future — and have been sending a large chunk of my paycheck back to the very government I work for — they will surely win based on their documentation.”

So this is who we are now. For all sorts of reasons that made perfect sense at the time, we built additional repayment programs onto existing complexity onto well-meaning forgiveness overseen by multiple layers of responsible parties. And once that was done, Mr. Shafer, teacher of shelter dwellers and street kids and others whom fellow educators failed to reach, wasted a small fortune and will now shovel another one into the federal coffers.

Which leaves just one more question: If this is who we are, is it who we actually want to be?",A Student Loan Nightmare: The Teacher in the Wrong Payment Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/your-money/paying-for-college/student-loan-payments.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Two past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose.

“Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didn’t get the memo.”“I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuit’s decision quite surprising.","In a 2-to-1 ruling, the three-judge panel declared that the Peace Cross violated the First Amendment by having “a primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government and religion.”

Douglas Laycock, a religious liberties scholar and professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, praised the decision.

The cross “asserts the truth of one religion and, implicitly but necessarily, the falsehood of all other religions,” he said. “Its secondary meanings, as in honoring war dead, are entirely derivative of its primary meaning as a symbol of the Resurrection.”

If the Fourth Circuit denies a request for the full court to reconsider the panel’s decision, defenders of the monument vow to take the case to the Supreme Court. They argue that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent, threatening national treasures such as the 24-foot Canadian Cross of Sacrifice and 13-foot Argonne Cross in Arlington National Cemetery — both within the Fourth Circuit’s jurisdiction — as well as the ground zero “cross,” the steel beams discovered among World Trade Center debris now on display in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

“It is brooding hostility toward religion, a sort of cleansing,” said Kelly Shackelford, the president of First Liberty Institute, one of the legal groups aiding the American Legion in defending the cross. “We would immediately need to begin massive bulldozing and sandblasting of veterans memorials across the country in a way that most people would find inconceivable.”

In his Fourth Circuit dissent, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory, first appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued that the Establishment Clause “does not require the government ‘to purge from the public sphere’ any reference to religion.”

Supporters of the cross also argue that context is vital: The Peace Cross is displayed alongside an American flag, amid a park of memorials for veterans of various wars. Its four sides, they say, are marked prominently with patriotic, not religious, virtues: valor, endurance, courage and devotion. The fallen soldiers are listed on a tablet with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson.

But opponents say it is hardly integrated: No other monument in the area is taller than 10 feet, and there are no other religious symbols in the park. They note that its fallen soldiers’ names are rusted away and obscured by bushes. And the cross has been the site of prayer gatherings as well as Veterans Day vigils — and even such vigils are often opened in prayer.

Two past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.

In McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, officials had authorized the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses. After pushback, they had modified the exhibits to include Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and other historical documents, arguing that the Ten Commandments were similarly influential in the development of Western legal thought.

The Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose. Michael W. McConnell, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford, calls such displays “triumphalism — a flavor of who is top dog.”

In a second case, Thomas Van Orden v. Rick Perry, the court allowed carvings of the Ten Commandments in a Texas State Capitol monument that had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a primarily secular group, in 1961. The court cited the donor’s lack of religious intent.

In his Van Orden opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who cast the swing vote in both cases, called the historical factor alone “determinative”: The monument had stood since 1961 without controversy.

The Peace Cross, also donated by a secular group, is almost twice as old as the monument in that case, and has been on public property for a comparable span. If the Supreme Court reviews this one, Mr. McConnell believes it will be squarely governed by Justice Breyer’s opinion.

“I think they thought they were putting this kind of case to rest with Van Orden,” said Mr. McConnell, who has also served as a judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. “Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didn’t get the memo.”

“I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuit’s decision quite surprising. If the Supreme Court were to grant review, the likelihood is very high that it would be reversed.”

But Peace Cross opponents argue that there is a stark difference between the Ten Commandments and a cross — namely, the figures each represents.

“The court pointed out that Moses was a lawmaker as well as a religious leader,” said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the American Humanist Association, who argued the case in the Fourth Circuit. “There were connections to the nation’s history of lawmakers that made the Ten Commandments overall less religious than an enormous, free-standing Latin cross that unequivocally represents Christianity.”

The Supreme Court’s thinking on displays of the cross is murky.

In Salazar v. Buono, a 2010 decision regarding a cross-shaped war memorial in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, six justices wrote distinct opinions. In 2011, when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal regarding a series of highway memorial crosses for fallen police officers in Utah, Justice Clarence Thomas’s 19-page dissent argued that the court had rejected “an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles.”

Awaiting its fate, the Peace Cross stands with a tarp draped neatly across the top, where the concrete has begun to crumble. Elizave Mordan, the King Pawn manager, can see it from her shop.

“We heard they may be taking it down, and I disagree with that. It just doesn’t bother anybody around here,” she said as she sorted through used power tools, record players and antique jewelry for sale.

“I worry nobody is going to remember them,” she said of the 49 fallen soldiers. “You can’t remember something you cannot see.”",A 40-Foot Cross Has Honored War Dead for 90 Years.

“With MaineCare I believe I’d be able to find a provider who would see me,” she said, referring to the state’s Medicaid program. “But a lot of people here don’t vote. So many families here are having addiction problems with their loved ones, and they’re not focused on going to vote — even though those are the people that need it the most.”

Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire cost of new enrollees under Medicaid expansion for the first three years and will continue to pay at least 90 percent. (States cover a significantly larger portion of the expenses of the regular Medicaid program.) The law allows any citizen with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level — $16,642 for an individual, $24,600 for a family of four — to qualify.

The main arguments for expanding the program here are that it would help financially fragile rural hospitals, create jobs and provide care for vulnerable people who have long gone without it.

But Mr. LePage and other opponents say that Maine should know better. The state undertook a more modest expansion of Medicaid in 2002, under former Gov. Angus King, an independent. Afterward, Maine struggled with budget shortfalls and fell behind on Medicaid payments to hospitals.

“People don’t want to acknowledge the unintended consequences that Maine has already experienced,” said Brent Littlefield, a political adviser to Mr. LePage who is serving as the spokesman for Welfare to Work, the committee leading the opposition. He said that even with the federal government paying most of the cost — a situation that could change if Congress eventually succeeds in repealing Obamacare — the state could owe close to $100 million a year, according to estimates from the LePage administration.

The Office of Program and Fiscal Review has estimated a lower state cost, about $54 million a year once the federal share drops to 90 percent in 2021. Maine would not receive the full 90 percent match for parents of young children because many already qualify for the program.

Maine’s legislature, which is controlled by Democrats in the House and Republicans, by one vote, in the Senate, could move to block the referendum if it were to pass, but since it voted for Medicaid expansion five times already, supporters and opponents alike believe it is unlikely to meddle.

The late Dodgers outburst came after an unlikely pitcher’s duel between the teams’ No. 4 starters, Alex Wood of the Dodgers and Charlie Morton of the Astros. Wood carried a no-hitter into the sixth on Saturday, when Springer produced the game’s first run with his homer. Morton was only slightly less flawless, facing the minimum number of batters through five innings.

Thus far, each game has delivered an unexpected element. Game 1 came with extreme 103-degree heat. Game 2 brought a rare blown save by Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and late, no-quit, home run-fueled comebacks by both teams. And Game 3 was marred by a racist gesture by Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel.

Gurriel’s act, in which he stretched the side of his eyes after hitting a home run off the Dodgers’ Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish, provided the backdrop for Game 4.

On Saturday afternoon, Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended Gurriel for five games at the start of the 2018 season, but chose not to discipline him for this Series, in part because he did not want to penalize the rest of the Astros. His decision drew support from Roberts, whose mother is Japanese.

“I think that it gives us all some closure in the sense that it was something that happened,” Roberts said. “The way that it was dealt with, I support.”

Gurriel, who received modest cheers from Astros fans when he came to the plate for his first at-bat on Saturday, was not a factor as Game 4 proceeded. But Bellinger was.

Bellinger, who made his Dodgers debut when veteran Adrian Gonzalez was injured this season, generally carries himself well beyond his years, owing to a reserved personality and the preparation provided by his father, Clay, who won two World Series rings with the Yankees.

“He’s got no pulse; he really doesn’t have a memory, either,” said Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who is 23 and in his third postseason. “He forgets things. Things go away. That’s what you have to do in baseball — you have to forget the past, forget your last AB and move onto the next one. That’s what he did tonight.”

But Bellinger’s breakout night did come with a thought process on his part.

He was hitless in 13 at-bats, including eight strikeouts — four in Game 3 — as he came to the plate with one out in the seventh inning against Morton, who was nursing a 1-0 lead. Earlier, an insight had came to Bellinger when he went out to take batting practice: His teammates Andre Ethier and Logan Forsythe regularly hit the ball the opposite way when taking their pregame swings. So why not do the same?

“I was always told these really good hitters hit the ball the other way in B.P., and I had never done it and I wanted to try it,” said the left-handed hitting Bellinger, who proceeded to hit every ball to left field during the practice session.

The struggles Bellinger endured in the Series were not unlike those of another ballyhooed rookie — the Yankees’ Aaron Judge — who emerged from a postseason slump midway through the American League Championship Series against the same Astros team Bellinger was now facing.

“I watched and we were identical, striking out a lot, swinging at a lot of off-speed pitches that we don’t normally swing at,” Bellinger said of Judge. “I think that’s the pressure of the postseason sometimes.”

The Astros had put Bellinger in a funk by throwing him back-foot breaking balls and fastballs away — pitches that are difficult to pull. But when Morton threw a 3-2 curveball to him in the seventh, he left it over the plate and Bellinger drove it the opposite way. Left fielder Marwin Gonzalez gave chase, but could not track it down.

As Bellinger coasted into second with a double, he raised his hands and gazed upward as if to give thanks for his first hit of the series.

It was also enough to chase Morton. He had survived the top of the sixth after Astros third baseman Alex Bregman threw Barnes out at home to keep the game scoreless. It was almost identical to a pivotal play Bregman made in Game 7 of the A.L.C.S., when he gunned down the Yankees’ Greg Bird at home to preserve a 1-0 lead.

But after Bellinger’s double an inning later, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch had a brief conversation with Morton on the mound and then called on his rested bullpen. Will Harris came on to retire Yasiel Puig on a deep fly to right field, but Forsythe followed by lining a 2-0 fastball for a single that easily scored Bellinger.

The Dodgers weren’t done. In the ninth, Giles — who surrendered a two-run lead in Game 2 — gave up a single to Seager and a walk to Justin Turner. Bellinger followed by driving a 1-0 fastball into the left-center gap for a double that scored Seager and sent Turner to third.

“The double he hit to left-center, he stayed on that curveball pretty good,” Astros catcher Brian McCann said of the first double. “And the one in the ninth, he cheated on the heater.”

They were not the swings of an overmatched youngster, or of someone weighed down by the moment. Instead, they were taken by someone who understood what to remember and what to forget, and the result was a World Series that might end up going the distance.","Cody Bellinger Breaks Through, Leading the Dodgers Past the Astros",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/sports/baseball/world-series-dodgers-astros.html

“There is going to be an enormous crush of borrowers who think they are eligible only to find that they are not,” said Seth Frotman, the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which published a report on the subject in June. “We need to get ready for it.”

All Mr. Shafer has been trying to do for more than 25 years is get ready for a career where he could make a difference while also earning enough to buy a home and help raise a family. The son of a fisherman and a mother who eventually became a teacher herself, Mr. Shafer, 46, does indeed own a cozy house on a street with gorgeous foliage. He and his wife live with their two sons, ages 10 and 4.

At work, Mr. Shafer offers job interview advice to one student while plotting financial aid application strategies with another. The classroom where he and his colleagues work has notices on the walls about housing and a free Thanksgiving dinner.

But at home over the last two years, he has spent many hours communicating with his current loan servicer, FedLoan, which is part of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. Eventually, he contacted elected officials and the Department of Education’s ombudsman department. The fact that he has had more than one servicer is a big part of what seems to have gone wrong.

As Mr. Shafer tells it, teacher circles were abuzz back in 2007 when the federal public service loan forgiveness program came into existence. Five years earlier, he had consolidated all of his student loans into a single one. At the time, his servicer verified his income and put him into a repayment plan where his payments would grow slowly over time, presumably as his income grew.

In 2007, Mr. Shafer said, he called his servicer at the time, ACS Education Services, and told the company that he wanted to enroll in the public service loan forgiveness program. No problem, he said he had been told, as long as he made his payments on time for 120 months. When ACS exited the federal loan servicing business, his loan moved to Mohela, short for the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, in 2012. Nothing, he said, that he heard or saw from Mohela gave him pause.

In 2013, he heard this from a fellow teacher: Once borrowers in the public service loan forgiveness program reached 120 payments, only one servicer, FedLoan, could forgive the remaining balance. So Mr. Shafer did what he needed to do to move his loans there.

It was at that point that things began to go off the rails. Remember that repayment program that Mr. Shafer ended up in back in 2002? It is what’s known as a graduated repayment plan, and if you’re in one, you’re not eligible for public service loan forgiveness. He was supposed to be in one of the income-based plans.

All along, Mr. Shafer said, people at the three servicers told him that his loan was in “good status” when he asked whether he was on track for forgiveness in 2017. The phone representatives at these servicers, however, may have been defining that term more narrowly — namely, that he was merely making on-time payments. It’s also possible that they simply didn’t understand the highly specific requirements of the loan forgiveness program.

In 2015, Mr. Shafer received an email from FedLoan that definitively alerted him to the fact that none of his eight years of payments had counted toward forgiveness. He panicked and spent the next year fighting back, flabbergasted that so much time had gone by without any of the three servicers telling him that anything was wrong when he had quite specifically and repeatedly inquired.

So why didn’t they? A spokesman for ACS’s current owner said it could not comment on the concerns of a past borrower, even though Mr. Shafer granted the company permission to do so. A Mohela spokesman said that while it didn’t have specific records of having told Mr. Shafer that his payments were not qualifying, its phone representative’s contact with him in January 2013 was probably what spurred him to move his loans to FedLoan to become eligible for the forgiveness program. Mr. Shafer said that was not so.

At FedLoan, a spokesman said it had told Mr. Shafer that he had a problem, more than once, by phone and through other communications. Indeed, in Mr. Shafer’s pile of documents, I did find a 2014 statement that said, on the back, that he had not made any qualifying payments. Mr. Shafer had missed that, and many others probably did, too, given that FedLoan didn’t bother to put this crucial piece of information on the front of the bill, let alone in 100-point neon “You are doing this wrong” type.

As for FedLoan’s specific assertion that it disclosed the problem to him by phone in 2013, Mr. Shafer responds with the following: Why on earth would he have not jumped on the problem instantly and aggressively if he had heard that in 2013?

There does not appear to be any happy ending in the offing for Mr. Shafer, and after a year of appeals, he did move himself into an eligible repayment plan. If nothing else happens to mess this all up again, he should finish paying off his loans when he is 55, about the time that his first child starts college. That will be 37 years after he took out his first loan as a teenager.

Worried that your story will end with similar bad news? There are four crucial requirements in the public service loan forgiveness program. You have to be in an eligible job, with an eligible loan, making the right kind of payments (which was what tripped Mr. Shafer up) and doing so in the right way. A column I wrote in April outlines the process, even if conquering it proves to be another matter.

Mr. Shafer remains baffled by it all. Perspiring at his dining room table this week after a meal of halibut that he had caught himself, he sipped a second adult beverage and tried to understand what had happened. In what other area of life, he wondered aloud, would you pay your bills on time only to be told that the payments hadn’t counted?

Later on in the week, he put it like so: “They have the power, regardless of my service and full payments, to make me look inept. Though I have been working hard for 18 years to help young people graduate from high school and build a viable future — and have been sending a large chunk of my paycheck back to the very government I work for — they will surely win based on their documentation.”

So this is who we are now. For all sorts of reasons that made perfect sense at the time, we built additional repayment programs onto existing complexity onto well-meaning forgiveness overseen by multiple layers of responsible parties. And once that was done, Mr. Shafer, teacher of shelter dwellers and street kids and others whom fellow educators failed to reach, wasted a small fortune and will now shovel another one into the federal coffers.

Which leaves just one more question: If this is who we are, is it who we actually want to be?",A Student Loan Nightmare: The Teacher in the Wrong Payment Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/your-money/paying-for-college/student-loan-payments.html

This production moves. But besides the set, its chief cleverness lies in its choice of music, a collage clipped from various film scores by Bernard Herrmann. It’s the sound of “The Ghost and Mrs. Muir” and Alfred Hitchcock, of high anxiety and romantic melodrama, with string sections desperately scaling musical cliffs and orchestral waves crashing.

The deftness with which Mr. Bourne (aided by the arranger Terry Davies) makes Herrmann’s musical moods and cues serve his story gives sustained delight. The shoe keeps fitting.

The production’s achievements, though, are tangled up with its flaws. Crucial plot points can get lost in the bustle and detail. And Mr. Bourne’s push for efficiency — making a dance number work both as period flavor and plot advancement, quickly slipping in a dramatic turning point in the middle of something else — can shortchange or skirt character motivation and decision making.

Mr. Bourne is a master of surface style, and the abundance and variety of pastiche dance — from the stiff, hoppy ridiculousness of aristocrats to awful music hall numbers to an ample survey of between-the-wars ballet — is another pleasure, especially for connoisseurs. Yet all this affectionate parody leaves him without much of a straight mode. The anguished danced monologues share the atmosphere of parody.

Photo

Meanwhile, the story has been streamlined and simplified, transformed into a standard love triangle. The tension in the film between Lermontov’s personal involvement and his principled objection to a ballerina’s marrying is absent. So is his religious devotion to ballet. Admittedly, these are difficult layers to convey without dialogue, but when Mr. Bourne has Lermontov moon over a statue of a shoe, the spiritual pursuit of beauty has been reduced to a foot fetish.

The show’s conception of Lermontov is characteristic of its swerving from the challenge of the film’s indelible performances. Anton Walbrook’s flamboyant portrayal of the impresario is, along with the saturated colors, the movie’s greatest glory. Sam Archer, who plays Lermontov in every New York performance of Mr. Bourne’s show, is dashing but subdued, buttoned-up British instead of larger-than-life Russian.

Despite Mr. Bourne’s tidying, he doesn’t take the opportunity to flesh out the love story between Vicky and Julian. As in the movie, it basically comes out of nowhere, though the thinness is more of a problem without a complicated Lermontov. Mr. Gomes, imparting Julian with his usual warmth and charisma, helped, but couldn’t redeem the role’s histrionic conducting. Ms. Mearns, out of her usual element, fit in fine, her sense of drama proving equal to the role’s acting demands, her performance only a tiny bit rougher than that of the first-cast Vicky, Ashley Shaw. (Ms. Mearns and Mr. Gomes, by the way, make an excellent couple: Company directors and casting agents take note.)

Where Mr. Bourne’s show most successfully breaks free of the original is in the “Red Shoes” ballet, the allegorical work that Lermontov and Julian make for Vicky. In a reverse homage to the movie’s surreal colors, Mr. Brotherston sticks to black and white and gray, and Mr. Bourne’s choreography finds its own stylized nightmare.

But a strong filter also creates real problems, because it effectively lies about reality to both the healthy and the sick. It lies to the healthy about the likelihood that they will one day suffer, hiding the fact that even in modernity the Book of Ecclesiastes still applies. It lies to the sick about how alone they really are, because when they were healthy that seemed like perfect normalcy, so they must now be outliers, failures, freaks.

And this deception is amplified now that so much social interaction takes place between disembodied avatars and curated selves, in a realm of Instagrammed hyper-positivity that makes suffering even more isolating than it is in the real world.

These thoughts are in my mind because I’ve been reading “Before You Wake,” by the conservative pundit Erick Erickson, a memoir addressed to his children and inspired by the descent of different life-threatening illnesses upon himself and his wife.

I found the book particularly striking because, like many people in our profession, I know Erickson virtually but not really in real life — which means, in fact, that I don’t know him, I know only the pugilistic piece of him that shows up for fights online. So reading his personal story is a small experiment in weakening the filter, in shaking off the spell of simulated life, of letting a person’s suffering give you a glimpse of them in full.

But beyond the virtual/real distinction it’s also interesting to watch a writer try to impart a sense of what a Via Dolorosa is really like, of how you make sense of it and bear it, to people he otherwise tries to protect from suffering — his children.

Because this seems to me to be the signal failing of modern education — visible among my own peers, now entering the time of life when suffering is more the weather than a lightning strike, but especially among the generation younger than us, who seem to be struggling with the contrast between what social media and meritocracy tell them they should feel and what they actually experience.

In America we have education for success, but no education for suffering. There is instead the filter, the well-meaning deception, that teaches neither religious hope nor stoicism, and when suffering arrives encourages group hysteria, private shame and a growing contagion of despair.

A.G. Nothing!

A lot of people know you from large pieces like “Spoonbridge and Cherry” in Minneapolis. How do you feel about them?

C.O. Public things take two or three years, they’re made out of heavy stuff, which is also very costly. That’s what the big projects are: working in architecture. You need someone who backs it and who trusts you, and whom you trust. You need to be more than yourself. For example, I had Coosje van Bruggen, my late wife, and she was very smart, and very good and kind, and we worked together on them.

How long do the two of you go back?

C.O. The beginning of the ’60s. After a couple of years in New York, I started to go into something different than painting.

Why?

C.O. Everything changed. You could paint a very beautiful picture of somebody and nobody would care. Everybody was doing something different. It was explosive, and it was the beginning of a new period of art. You could do almost anything.

A.G. There were very few revolutions in sculpture, and Claes’s soft sculptures made up one of the great revolutions. It was the antithesis of what sculpture previously was about. Sculpture was hard.

But you didn’t start with soft sculptures, right?

C.O. I came to New York in ’56, and I didn’t have very much money. I started to buy Life magazines, and I started to cut things out of the magazines, and that was my first American statement, these collages. They’re kind of scary, some of them, and they’re definitely hard to interpret.

Perhaps your work has a darker undercurrent than some realize?

C.O. Oh yes, I totally agree with you. That was a period when I made a lot of dirty work. I did a lot of erotic drawings.

A.G. The Museum of Modern Art just recently bought the biggest, most explicit, erotic drawing actually.

That brings up the fact that you once depicted the human figure, but not for decades. Why not?

C.O. People have become objects. I think there’s a point at which you choose between a person and things. And I chose things. And you can express just as many things about persons by using things.

Did the softness of bodies somehow transfer to sculpture?

C.O. Yes. I spent a lot of time painting human beings, especially nudes. And you might say that’s a source of the interest in soft things.

The works in “Shelf Life” are relatively small. How long does it take to make them?

C.O. It takes as long as it takes. I would say you put things together in maybe a week or two, and then pull them apart for a week, and then you find another idea that sneaks in and so on.

But do you work most days?

C.O. Of course. I try to anyway. Some days are wonderful, and some days are awful. That’s how things go. This group of things was started earlier this year. Part of the reason it’s on a small scale was because I wasn’t exactly sure where I was going at that point.

A.G. Each of these shelves is a store of ideas. There’s a kind of nostalgia — in the best sense — about these works. The history of your whole visual vocabulary is here.

C.O. Yeah. I haven’t been showing that kind of work. This will be the first time.

A.G. Claes, you said something touching to me: “You have to decide at some point what you’re going to keep and what you’re going to throw away,” and obviously these are things that you kept.

Is there something that inspires that decision?

C.O. I want to be working all the time. Why suddenly I should go into this? I haven’t quite figured that out yet.

I sort of like the scale of this work, because I can handle the scale at my age. I like small things. That’s a fact. I like big things, but I also like small things.

What small things have your attention now?

To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

“It still feels a little quiet for a gubernatorial race,” said Senator Mark Warner, the state’s senior Democrat.

But the stakes in Virginia for Democrats nationally are high. The party has failed to win any significant races since President Trump’s election, and the fundamentals are weighted in their favor in Virginia, where the president is deeply unpopular and the last time a Republican won a statewide top-of-ballot race was in 2009, when Bob McDonnell’s election as governor presaged Republican gains nationally the following year.

Outside the Washington suburbs, Republicans dominate vast swaths of the state, mainly in areas where the population and economy are flat or declining. The political divide mirrors a fractious cultural one that has played out in fights throughout the state over whether to remove Confederate monuments, ban sanctuary cities or round up immigrants in the country illegally. If the core constituency that helped Democrats carry the state in the last three presidential elections does not turn out, it will be that Republican Virginia that prevails.

“It’s really not old vs. new,” said David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the state legislature representing the region. “It’s NOVA vs. ROVA, Northern Virginia vs. the Rest of Virginia.”

With its thriving technology sector and data centers that sprout up like the crops that preceded them on one-time farmland, Northern Virginia is the economic engine of the state, attracting a diverse, highly skilled and well-paid work force, many of them immigrants.

“The three major metropolitan areas in the state (Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads) contain more than 90 percent of the total growth,” Qian Cai, director of demographic research at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said in an email. She also noted that “between 2010 and 2016, 45 of Virginia’s 95 counties witnessed population decline.”

Virginia’s immigrant population grew four times as fast as its native-born population from 2007 to 2015, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, bringing its numbers to about one in eight Virginians.

In Loudoun County, several elementary schools are majority South Asian. The area is also home to one of the largest mosques on the East Coast. Vietnamese and Korean immigrants have long been a presence. And, as in other places across the country, the number of Latinos moving into the area is growing rapidly as well.

Many of these immigrants, who tend to be socially and fiscally conservative, are not naturally Democrats. But Mr. Ramadan and others said Republicans’ harsh approach to immigration has driven them to be Democrats, and it may be difficult to get them back.

“They are people of faith. They came here for less government. They are natural voters for the Republican Party,” Mr. Ramadan said. “But they are also emotional voters. They want to feel accepted. They want to feel welcome, but the Republican Party has failed to do so. Democrats have done a much better job.”

Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman who represented Northern Virginia, said he saw the transformation happening “under my feet.”

“We are losing ethnic voters en masse,” Mr. Davis said. “Vietnamese, Koreans used to be the backbone of my vote. They are very Republican in the way they live their lives, but I saw the immigration issue just turn it south.”

In a presidential election year, Democrats have been able to rack up large majorities in the counties near Washington. But turnout drops substantially in off-year cycles, and Republicans can capitalize on a more loyal core of voters.

Turnout among immigrants is not the only concern for the Northam campaign. He will need another crucial part of the Democratic coalition: African-American voters in Northern Virginia, Richmond and the Hampton Roads area. Mr. Northam has been trying to stoke energy in urban areas, and former President Barack Obama recently appeared with him at a rally in Richmond.

“I think the big question for me on the election is: Can Lieutenant Governor Northam excite the traditional Democratic voting base in Northern Virginia and the urban centers,” said Bill Bolling, a Republican former lieutenant governor.

That explains why both Mr. Gillespie, who as a national party leader tried to reach out to minority voters, and Mr. Northam, who some Republicans once wanted to try to recruit to switch parties, have been running campaigns aimed at base voters, with Mr. Gillespie emphasizing crimes by illegal immigrants and pledging to oppose sanctuary cities — even though Virginia does not have any — and Mr. Northam trying to yoke his opponent to Mr. Trump.

Mr. Ramadan said he ran as a conservative and won a district that was 60 percent Democratic in his state delegate race from a Loudoun County district.

“I have been telling my party until there is no breath left in me, you truly need to widen the tent and not just talk about it,” Mr. Ramadan said. “And start working the new voters of Virginia and not the old voters that are shrinking in Southwest. The future is Northern Virginia. The future is the Asian vote. The future is the Latino vote.”

Mr. Warner’s career has tracked the tensions between old and new. He was elected governor in 2001, largely by mitigating losses in rural areas by devoting large amounts of time to campaigning there.

It worked for him then, and again in 2008 when he won his first term in the Senate. Even as the state’s voting population was changing, though, he barely defeated Mr. Gillespie in 2014 to keep his Senate race, losing even rural areas where he had been popular. The new voters in Northern Virginia did not turn out, and the rural voters Mr. Warner had courted spurned him.

It is an open question now whether it is even worth a Democrat’s time to try to win those rural areas, given the possible yield to be had by campaigning more vigorously in Northern Virginia. But the transition from old to new Virginia is still evolving.

From her fifth-floor office, Phyllis J. Randall, a Democrat and the first African-American woman to lead a Virginia county board of supervisors, can look down on the courthouse square in Leesburg, the Loudoun County seat. Just beyond her view is a monument to Confederate soldiers that has been the subject of heated protests.

She favors moving the monument but said older members of her board and community disagreed.

“It is so generational,” she said. “People 35 and younger grew up in a more multicultural area, so I think there are times when younger people have a lesson to give older people.”

In Manassas, where Mr. Iyer’s restaurant does brisk lunch business, schools and car dealerships incorporate the word “battlefield,” a reflection that the area’s tourism economy thrives in part by celebrating both sides of Civil War heritage. And yet, at the Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center shopping mall on a recent morning, the majority of morning customers at Starbucks and the Apple store were minorities.

Mr. Trump’s turbulent first nine months as president will also affect the outcome. Many of his policies will excite the voters in rural areas. Mr. Trump has backed Mr. Gillespie via Twitter, though so far he has not campaigned with him.

Mr. Northam’s hopes rest in part on the votes of people like Mr. Iyer.

START SMALL If you’re nervous about playing with a deep, dark hue, “limit the color to the inside of cabinets, backs of bookshelves or a painted floor,” said Donald Kaufman, who owns the paint company Donald Kaufman Color with his wife, Taffy Dahl. “Dark, bold windows often bring the outside in.”

Ms. Studholme, of Farrow & Ball, suggested starting with a contained space like a powder room, the underside of a claw-foot tub or a hallway. “When you arrive, it creates a sense of drama,” she said. “You come through and go, ‘Wow.’” An added bonus, she noted: “A dark color in the hall makes the rooms off the hall feel really big and light.”

Ellen O’Neill, director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore, recommends starting with a focal point, like a fireplace mantel or the inside of shelves or drawers. “I recently photographed a home where the owner painted the inside of the drawers of an antique Chippendale chest a rich aubergine,” she said. “What a color surprise every time you open a drawer.” And as you become more confident, she said, “you can graduate to painting doors to a room or hallway, window trim or wainscoting.”

TEST IT OUT When you’re ready to tackle a whole room, “start with a color family that is already dominant in the home and select two to three shades that you feel makes a statement,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I’d get quarts of each color and paint large swatches of each, one set next to a window and one set in a corner. Observe how the room’s lighting affects the colors three times a day.”

EMBRACE THE DARKNESS “A deep, rich color goes an especially long way in a room without a lot of natural light, as dim rooms look particularly dull in lighter colors,” said Frances Merrill, the founder of Reath Design in Los Angeles, who painted her children’s room Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon gray. “It makes the small space feel finished and gives definition to the ever-rotating collection of artwork.”

In the playroom, she used Templeton Gray from Benjamin Moore. “Every surface in this room is usually covered in a layer of Legos and half-finished science experiments,” she said. “I find that the deeper colors mask the chaos.”

“Conventional wisdom states that small spaces — especially those facing north — should be lightened to increase the sense of space,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute consultancy. “However, painting trim a lighter color in an area painted with darker hues can actually increase the illusion of space,” she said, because it creates a “greater impression of height or width in the space.”

Whatever your situation, “it’s best to work with what you’ve got, rather than try to fight the light,” said Ms. Studholme of Farrow & Ball, which offers a guide to how light affects color on its website.

PREPARATION IS KEY “Before painting, ensure surfaces are sound, clean, dry and free from dirt, grease and any other contamination,” said Ms. Cosby of Farrow & Ball. “Always sand down surfaces to achieve a smooth base.”

And if you change your mind later, dark colors are just as easy to paint over as light ones, assuming you prep properly. “Start by priming over the bold hue, then apply two coats of the desired color,” said Ms. O’Neill of Benjamin Moore. But “be sure to allow the primer coat to dry completely before applying the first coat of color.”

GO HALFSIES To add “sophistication and spirit” to a client’s “stark, boxy, white rental,” Alex Kalita, a founder of Common Bond Design in Manhattan, painted the bottom half of the bedroom wall in Hague Blue from Farrow & Ball. She calls it “the chair-rail effect” and notes that it serves a few purposes: “It simulates architectural variation in otherwise uniform space; it ties in the building’s teal window frames; and it leverages the cozy, rich, complex and grown-up quality of Hague Blue, while maintaining the practical qualities of white paint, like the illusion of ceiling height.”

Photo

Another tip: “If you’re tempted to go dark and bold on the walls, but you prefer a restrained aesthetic, try keeping the furniture neutral,” Ms. Kalita said. “You can even make bulkier pieces recede by camouflaging them in the wall color. We had our client’s Wonk NYC dresser color-matched to Hague Blue, so that the piece could augment the client’s storage without competing for attention with the room’s more deliberate and sculptural design elements. Dark walls do a good job of visually absorbing things.”

FINALLY, BE BRAVE “I encourage people to be brave with color and unleash their inner artist,” said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Experiment with color, have fun with it, allow yourself to live with it for a while. It is, after all, just one or two cans of paint. And when, and if, you tire of it, move on to another color and treat yourself to another creative exercise.”",Scared of Dark Paint?

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

AKRON, Ohio — Drug overdose deaths in 2016 most likely exceeded 59,000, the largest annual jump ever recorded in the United States, according to preliminary data compiled by The New York Times.

The death count is the latest consequence of an escalating public health crisis: opioid addiction, now made more deadly by an influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and similar drugs. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50.

Although the data is preliminary, the Times’s best estimate is that deaths rose 19 percent over the 52,404 recorded in 2015. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017.

Drug overdose deaths, 1980 to 2016 *Estimate based on preliminary data

Because drug deaths take a long time to certify, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be able to calculate final numbers until December. The Times compiled estimates for 2016 from hundreds of state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners. Together they represent data from states and counties that accounted for 76 percent of overdose deaths in 2015. They are a first look at the extent of the drug overdose epidemic last year, a detailed accounting of a modern plague.

The initial data points to large increases in drug overdose deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, we estimate overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.

“Heroin is the devil’s drug, man. It is,” Cliff Parker said, sitting on a bench in Grace Park in Akron. Mr. Parker, 24, graduated from high school not too far from here, in nearby Copley, where he was a multisport athlete. In his senior year, he was a varsity wrestler and earned a scholarship to the University of Akron. Like his friends and teammates, he started using prescription painkillers at parties. It was fun, he said. By the time it stopped being fun, it was too late. Pills soon turned to heroin, and his life began slipping away from him.

Mr. Parker’s story is familiar in the Akron area. From a distance, it would be easy to paint Akron — “Rubber Capital of the World” — as a stereotypical example of Rust Belt decay. But that’s far from a complete picture. While manufacturing jobs have declined and the recovery from the 2008 recession has been slow, unemployment in Summit County, where Akron sits, is roughly in line with the United States as a whole. The Goodyear factories have been retooled into technology centers for research and polymer science. The city has begun to rebuild. But deaths from drug overdose here have skyrocketed.

In 2016, Summit County had 312 drug deaths, according to Gary Guenther, the county medical examiner’s chief investigator — a 46 percent increase from 2015 and more than triple the 99 cases that went through the medical examiner’s office just two years before. There were so many last year, Mr. Guenther said, that on three separate occasions the county had to request refrigerated trailers to store the bodies because they’d run out of space in the morgue.

It’s not unique to Akron. Coroners’ offices throughout the state are being overwhelmed.

In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 99 tested positive for fentanyl or an analogue.

Fentanyl isn’t new. But over the past three years, it has been popping up in drug seizures across the country.

Most of the time, it’s sold on the street as heroin, or drug traffickers use it to make cheap counterfeit prescription opioids. Fentanyls are showing up in cocaine as well, contributing to an increase in cocaine-related overdoses.

The most deadly of the fentanyl analogues is carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer 5,000 times stronger than heroin. An amount smaller than a few grains of salt can be a lethal dose.

“July 5th, 2016 — that’s the day carfentanil hit the streets of Akron,” said Capt. Michael Shearer, the commander of the Narcotics Unit for the Akron Police Department. On that day, 17 people overdosed and one person died in a span of nine hours. Over the next six months, the county medical examiner recorded 140 overdose deaths of people testing positive for carfentanil. Just three years earlier, there were fewer than a hundred drug overdose deaths of any kind for the entire year.

This exponential growth in overdose deaths in 2016 didn't extend to all parts of the country. In some states in the western half of the U.S., our data suggests deaths may have leveled off or even declined. According to Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert in heroin use in the United States, this geographic variation may reflect a historical divide in the nation’s heroin market between the powdered heroin generally found east of the Mississippi River and the Mexican black tar heroin found to the west.

This divide may have kept deaths down in the West for now, but according to Dr. Ciccarone, there is little evidence of differences in the severity of opioid addiction or heroin use. If drug traffickers begin to shift production and distribution in the West from black tar to powdered heroin in large quantities, fentanyl will most likely come along with it, and deaths will rise.

First responders are finding that, with fentanyl and carfentanil, the overdoses can be so severe that multiple doses of naloxone — the anti-overdose medication that often goes by the brand name Narcan — are needed to pull people out. In Warren County in Ohio, Doyle Burke, the chief investigator at the county coroner’s office, has been watching the number of drug deaths rise as the effectiveness of Narcan falls. “E.M.S. crews are hitting them with 12, 13, 14 hits of Narcan with no effect,” said Mr. Burke, likening a shot of Narcan to “a squirt gun in a house fire.”

Early data from 2017 suggests that drug overdose deaths will continue to rise this year. It’s the only aspect of American health, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., that is getting significantly worse. Over two million Americans are estimated to be dependent on opioids, and an additional 95 million used prescription painkillers in the past year — more than used tobacco. “This epidemic, it’s got no face,” said Chris Eisele, the president of the Warren County Fire Chiefs’ Association and fire chief of Deerfield Township. The Narcotics Anonymous meetings here are populated by lawyers, accountants, young adults and teenagers who described comfortable middle-class upbringings.

Back in Akron, Mr. Parker has been clean for seven months, though he is still living on the streets. The ground of the park is littered with discarded needles, and many among the homeless here are current or former heroin users. Like most recovering from addiction, Mr. Parker needed several tries to get clean — six, by his count. The severity of opioid withdrawal means users rarely get clean unless they are determined and have treatment readily available. “No one wants their family to find them face down with a needle in their arm,” Mr. Parker said. “But no one stops until they’re ready.”

About the data

Our count of drug overdoses for 2016 is an estimate. A precise number of drug overdose deaths will not be available until December.

As the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics at the C.D.C., Robert Anderson oversees the collection and codification of the nation’s mortality data. He noted that toxicology results, which are necessary to assign a cause of death, can take three to six months or longer. “It’s frustrating, because we really do want to track this stuff,” he said, describing how timely data on cause of death would let public health workers allocate resources in the right places.

To come up with our count, we contacted state health departments in all 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, asking for their statistics on drug overdose deaths among residents. In states that didn't have numbers available, we turned to county medical examiners and coroners’ offices. In some cases, partial results were extrapolated through the end of the year to get estimates for 2016.

While noting the difficulty of making predictions, Mr. Anderson reviewed The Times’s estimates and said they seemed reasonable. The overdose death rate reported by the N.C.H.S. provisional estimates for the first half of 2016 would imply a total of 59,779 overdose deaths, if the death rate remains flat through the second half of the year. Based on our reporting, we believe this rate increased.

While the process in each state varies slightly, death certificates are usually first filled out by a coroner, medical examiner or attending physician. These death certificates are then collected by state health departments and sent to the N.C.H.S., which assigns what’s called an ICD-10 code to each death. This code specifies the underlying cause of death, and it’s what determines whether a death is classified as a drug overdose.

Sometimes, the cases are straightforward; other times, it’s not so easy. The people in charge of coding each death — called nosologists — have to differentiate between deaths due to drug overdose and those due to the long-term effects of drug abuse, which get a different code. (There were 2,573 such deaths in 2015.) When alcohol and drugs are both present, they must specify which of the two was the underlying cause. If it’s alcohol, it’s not a “drug overdose” under the commonly used definition. Ideally, every medical examiner, coroner and attending physician would fill out death certificates with perfect consistency, but there are often variations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction that can introduce inconsistencies to the data.

These inconsistencies are part of the reason there is a delay in drug death reporting, and among the reasons we can still only estimate the number of drug overdoses in 2016. Since we compiled our data from state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners directly, the deaths have not yet been assigned ICD-10 codes by the N.C.H.S. — that is, the official underlying cause of death has not yet been categorized. In addition, the mortality data in official statistics focuses on deaths among residents. But county coroners typically count up whichever deaths come through their office, regardless of residency. When there were large discrepancies between the 2015 counts from the C.D.C. and the state or county, we used the percent change from 2015 to calculate our 2016 estimate.

We can say with confidence that drug deaths rose a great deal in 2016, but it is hard to say precisely how many died or in which places drug deaths rose most steeply. Because of the delay associated with toxicology reports and inconsistencies in the reported data, our exact estimate — 62,497 total drug overdose deaths — could vary from the true number by several thousand.",Drug Deaths in America Are Rising Faster Than Ever,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention?
This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment.
More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough.
In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing.","Remember Anita Hill, who told a firing line of skeptical senators the story of constant harassment by her boss, Clarence Thomas, more than 25 years ago. The lawmakers, every one of them male, seemed less concerned with the alleged misconduct of a Supreme Court nominee than that a woman would drag such a tawdry subject into the halls of Congress. While Ms. Hill’s brave testimony prompted a sharp rise in sexual-harassment claims, she was vilified in public; nearly twice as many Americans said at the time that they believed now-Justice Thomas’s account of what happened over hers.

Remember former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity endures despite a long string of allegations of sexual misconduct and, in one case, rape — all of which he has denied. Mr. Clinton did eventually admit to the affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, that nearly toppled his presidency, but he pointed out that it was not illegal.

Then, of course, there’s the current occupant of the Oval Office, who won the election only weeks after the public heard him brag about grabbing women’s genitalia, and who once said that if his daughter were ever sexually harassed at work, she should go find a new job. That president leads a party intent on passing laws that would re-establish gender norms and hierarchies from the middle of the last century (Defund Planned Parenthood! No abortions after six weeks!) — making it harder for women to attain the social equality and economic independence that would go a long way toward reducing sexual harassment in the workplace.

In other words, even the highest-profile opportunities to change America’s endemic culture of sexual harassment, which is overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, committed by men against women, can somehow be lost or swept away. How do we keep that from happening again?

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention? The answer is part cultural, part economic and part legal.

The most conservative estimates say 25 percent of women have experienced sexual harassment at work, although the real number is surely much higher, since only a small fraction of such behavior is ever reported. As many as 90 percent of workers who are harassed never file a formal complaint, according to a 2016 report by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which receives more than 12,000 complaints of sex-based harassment each year.

The reasons for this silence are obvious: Women fear retaliation, indifference or disbelief if they speak up. If it’s hard for rich and famous people, so many of whom kept silent in the face of Mr. Weinstein’s well-known depredations, imagine how much harder it is for someone with no political or economic power. But the Weinstein saga also illustrates what a difference it can make when women join together — and men join with them — to confront harassers openly.

HOW TO CHANGE THE CULTURE The key is to foster work environments where women feel safe and men feel obliged to report sexual harassment. “People need to be afraid not just of doing these things, but also of not doing anything when someone around them does it,” Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, told The Times’s Nicholas Kristof last week. “If you know something is happening and you fail to take action, whether you are a man or a woman — especially when you are in power — you are responsible, too.”

But speaking up only goes so far if employers don’t make reporting harassment easy or the consequences for harassers swift and clear. Treating sexual harassment seriously is essential, not to protect against liability or to safeguard the bottom line, but because it’s wrong for anyone to have to endure harassment at work. (Though it sure helps when liability and the bottom line are at stake, too.)

Some of the nation’s largest companies are moving in the right direction. For example, McDonald’s, Burger King, Aramark and Walmart have signed on to a program requiring their tomato growers to adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits sexual harassment and assault of farmworkers, and provides a clear system for the growers’ 30,000 workers to file complaints. Fourteen businesses are part of the program; many more should join.

IT’S ABOUT POWER AND MONEY Sexual-harassment culture is tied directly to the economics of the workplace. Since harassment is about power, it’s no surprise that it thrives in industries where women are systematically kept out of powerful roles — and paid less for doing the same work as men. (This may help explain why sexual-harassment cases make up nearly half of all harassment complaints from the private sector, but less than 10 percent of those from employees of the federal government, where women have more opportunities to rise to positions of authority.)

Too often, male harassers use their economic power to silence women, as Mr. Weinstein and Mr. O’Reilly did repeatedly, offering them hefty payments in return for signing nondisclosure agreements. If employers were more responsive and harassment cases were easier to pursue in the courts, there would be fewer of these settlements, which can be good for individual women but allow the predatory behavior to continue unchecked.

One compromise could be to require businesses to report how many sexual-harassment claims they settle every year, or even how many complaints they receive. This would at least give prospective employees a chance to assess how bad the problem is at a given company, and could lead to greater public scrutiny in more extreme cases.

LEGAL BARRIERS The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion and other protected classes. Twelve years later, it made employers liable for supervisors’ harassment of workers. But in 2013, the court stepped backward, ruling that employers are liable only for racial or sexual harassment by a supervisor who has the power to fire a worker or prevent his or her promotion. In a 5-to-4 ruling, with only male justices in the majority, the court held that employers are not automatically liable for harassment by the larger number of supervisors who don’t have that power, even if they control all other aspects of a worker’s daily activities.

In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the decision ignored the realities of the modern workplace, and the “particular threatening character” of a supervisor’s power and authority, even one not vested with the power to fire. A worker who confronts a harassing supervisor risks “receiving an undesirable or unsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She may be saddled with an excessive workload or with placement on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family life.”

Congress could and should overturn that ruling today by passing a law that reinstates the broader and more realistic definition of a supervisor. But good luck with that; Capitol Hill can’t even keep its own house in order. Representative Jackie Speier of California, who said she was sexually assaulted years ago when she was a congressional staff member, told Politico on Thursday that the compliance office tasked with handling harassment complaints is “toothless,” and said that Congress has been “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.”

This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment. The elements for a permanent cultural shift are certainly in place. More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough. More women than men are graduating from college; more are earning advanced degrees; and increasing numbers are managers, though the proportions of women still become thinner and thinner the higher in management you look. And, crucially, the internet and social media have opened a door to instant communication and community support that didn’t exist before, helping women feel less isolation and shame about their experiences, and more confident that speaking out will have a positive result.

In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing. Boys must be raised to understand why that behavior is wrong, teenagers need to be reminded of it and grown men need to pay for it until they get the message.",Will Harvey Weinstein’s Fall Finally Reform Men?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a “clapper boy,” holding the slate up before a scene.
His first features as cinematographer, “Another Sky,” set in North Africa, and “Passing Stranger,” a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.
“It’s so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think you’re running along the ground, and then suddenly you’re jumping over the bushes and rising into the air,” Mr. Lassally said.
“He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights,” Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, “and it was an amazing experience to watch him.","Mr. Lassally worked with the director James Ivory on the period dramas that were the signature of Merchant Ivory Productions, like “The Wild Party” (1975), set in Hollywood of the 1920s, and “Heat and Dust” (1983), set partly in India of the 1920s. He shot comedies like “The Great Bank Hoax” (1978). He did the occasional television movie, including “The Man Upstairs,” a 1992 comic drama on CBS that starred Katharine Hepburn and Ryan O’Neal.

He could make even a mundane setting interesting, as Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted in his review of the 1969 film “3 Into 2 Won’t Go.”

“Walter Lassally,” Mr. Canby wrote, “who photographed some of Tony Richardson’s best films (‘The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner’), must, I assume, receive some of the credit for transforming a suburban house into a locale as fascinating and mysterious and necessary to this film as Monument Valley used to be to John Ford.”

Mr. Lassally was born on Dec. 18, 1926, in Berlin. His father was an engineer who sometimes used film as an adjunct to his work as he studied mechanical processes.

The family, Mr. Lassally said in an interview with the website Web of Stories, was not Jewish but had Jewish ancestors, making them unwelcome in their own country as the Nazis came to power. In 1939, just before the outbreak of war, they emigrated to England.

There was no immediate word on his survivors.

As a youngster Mr. Lassally worked at Riverside Studios in London as a “clapper boy,” holding the slate up before a scene. Riverside soon went bankrupt, but Mr. Lassally was on his way; in 1950 he was given the chance to shoot a fire-prevention documentary called “Every Five Minutes.”

He also began writing about moviemaking, becoming identified with the British documentary film movement known as Free Cinema.

His first features as cinematographer, “Another Sky,” set in North Africa, and “Passing Stranger,” a crime film set in a small British town, were both released in 1954.

“He started his career in documentaries and applied some of those techniques to his feature work in groundbreaking ways,” Stephen Pizzello, editor in chief and publisher of American Cinematographer magazine, said by email. “The mission of the Free Cinema movement was to produce realistic films about the working class, and its practitioners shot in authentic locations with relatively unknown actors and actresses; they were the guerrilla filmmakers of their day.”

In 1961 Mr. Richardson, who died in 1991, asked Mr. Lassally to shoot “A Taste of Honey,” a drama about a pregnant teenager, which Mr. Pizzello said was the first major British feature shot entirely on location. The next year the two made “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,” about a boy at an English reform school.

In 1963 came “Tom Jones,” a romantic romp, based on the Henry Fielding novel, set in the 18th century. It had a particularly memorable scene involving a stag hunt, which included countless hounds running alongside riders on galloping horses. Mr. Lassally found a thrilling way to render the scene, mixing conventional images with shots taken from a helicopter and a camera mounted so low on a truck that it could look up at the riders’ faces.

“It’s so cleverly intercut that sometimes you think you’re running along the ground, and then suddenly you’re jumping over the bushes and rising into the air,” Mr. Lassally said. “So that was a very effective technique, and it’s caused a lot of comment after. People always ask me, ‘How did you do that?’ ”

The cinematographer Tom Houghton worked as a gaffer with Mr. Lassally on later films, including the marital drama “Too Far to Go” (1979), and found it a vital learning experience.

“He took a great deal of care in the placement of lights,” Mr. Houghton told American Cinematographer for a 2008 article on Mr. Lassally, “and it was an amazing experience to watch him. The more I worked with him, the more I understood what he was going for. He knew how to create subtleties and nuances in the midst of simplicity, and he brought that sensibility from the smaller projects to the bigger films.”

In a 2015 interview with Radio Prague, Mr. Lassally summed up the importance of the look of a film.

“To me cinema is visual,” he said. “In a good film, you should be able to turn off the soundtrack and still get the story. Nowadays it’s the other way around. Most of the information tends to be in the dialogue and not in the pictures, and that’s not cinema to me.”","Walter Lassally, Cinematographer Who Won Oscar for ‘Zorba,’ Dies at 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/obituaries/walter-lassally-oscar-winning-cinematographer-dies-at-90.html

For years they had attended country shows together, giddy when they planned each adventure. On Oct. 1, they were just three California grandmothers joining the rest of crowd in singing “God Bless America.”

Then came the crack of gunfire, and they were three panicked women trapped in a killing field.

Pati died.

A bullet hit Kim in the back.

Only Dana emerged unharmed.

So much of the attention in the aftermath of mass shootings has been focused on the gunman and the number left dead in his wake. But the injured who survive carry a special burden. “We all kind of forget that these people have to live with it for the rest of their lives,” said Dr. Bryan Tsao, chair of the neurology department at Loma Linda University Health.

Dr. Tsao is still treating three patients from the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Battered physically and emotionally, none have been able to return to work, he said.

He described the post-shooting process as one of deconstructing old lives and reconstructing new ones.

“Those that I’ve seen that cannot — that cannot stop dwelling on the tragedy of it, on the injustice of it, on their permanent disability — they don’t do well,” he said. “They take the struggle and kind of go down a different road.”

“He took a part of me that I can’t get back”

Ms. Gervais is being treated at Loma Linda, not far from her house, and just four miles from the scene of the San Bernardino attack.

On Day 19 of her recovery, she was in her hospital room, in the wheelchair, wearing a neck brace and thick compression socks. A humidifier puffed mist above her head. Her daughter Amber Manka, 30, stood by with her own two children.

Ms. Gervais, 56, runs a business servicing trash compactors. She spends — or spent — her weekends riding ATVs in the desert, wearing leather gloves and a full-face helmet. When her husband, a sprint car racer, died after a crash, she raised her two girls on her own.

She had lived a difficult life, she said, which steeled her for challenges. But even for her, this was a lot. “I’m disgusted,” she said of the gunman. “I’m angered, I have all kinds of emotions toward him. Because he took a part of me that I can’t get back.”

She blames her injuries on Mr. Paddock, not the casino or the concert host or gunmakers. “I have nothing against guns. Just him.”

She has no feeling in her legs, and extremely limited use of her arms. Her daughters saw it as a victory when she was able to bend and extend her elbows, something doctors had not expected. She does about three hours of physical therapy a day.

“Why would one person do something like this to people?” she said. “If you’re that unhappy with your life, why hurt others?”

At night, the workers here turn her every few hours, to prevent bedsores. And sometimes she wakes up shaking.

Her daughter, Ms. Manka, has steered the family since the shooting, aided by her husband and younger sister.

She already has anxiety, and when she learned that her mother had been shot, she spent an hour vomiting.

In private, Ms. Manka said she was overwhelmed. “But mostly I just try to keep that away from her,” she said.

At the hospital, a man entered with a clipboard and said he was there to discuss the equipment Ms. Gervais will need when she goes home, which could be weeks or months from now. Among her needs are an expensive wheelchair, a remodeled bathroom, a new car, a nurse, and a way to run her business and pay her mortgage.

“You know,” he said, looking at the women, “your insurance will probably not cover any of this.”

Many families caught in mass attacks have found it difficult to pay for or get the care they need. Insurance companies put up fights. Donations run out.

After the San Bernardino shooting, the county repeatedly denied or delayed coverage to survivors, leaving people without the medicines, therapy and health aides their doctors said they needed.

Ms. Gervais would have to figure out the money later. For now, Ms. Manka used her right arm to spoon butter noodles into her mother’s mouth and her left to hold her daughter on her hip.

“Can I have some milk?” Ms. Gervais said.

Her daughter smiled and held the straw to her mother’s lips.

“I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital”

That night, a friend of Ms. Gervais had arranged a bingo fund-raiser to help pay for some of the costs. Collections from a GoFundMe page the family had started would barely cover the wheelchair.

Two hundred people crowded into an elementary school cafeteria, where a large sign bore the school motto: “No Excuses at Sky Country.”

“O-72!” said the bingo announcer.

At a lunch table in the back sat Dana Smith, the only one of the three women to make it out unscathed. She wore a blue shirt that matched her blue eyes.

Ms. Smith, 52, had known both Kim and Pati for more than 20 years, and was the one who had brought them all together.

In the weeks since the shooting, she had left the house three times, she said. She does not sleep or eat much, and spends time watching videos of that night, as if to remind herself it was real.

Some days she gets out of bed. “Wednesday I didn’t,” she said. “It was like I didn’t care. There was nothing to get me going.”

She has not returned to her job as an aide at a high school, because she is worried that the popping of milk cartons, a student prank, will throw her into a panic.

Melissa Strassner can relate. She was 14 in 1999, when two of her classmates went on a killing spree at Columbine High School. She watched them shoot her friend Anne Marie Hochhalter, and six months after the school shooting, Anne Marie’s mother killed herself.

“I felt like it had been my fault,” Ms. Strassner said. “If I had not run away from her, maybe she would not have been paralyzed, maybe her mother wouldn’t have made the decision she made.”

“You’re never going to be the person you were the day before the shooting,” she added. “You have to mourn the loss of that person.”

Ms. Smith had visited Ms. Gervais a few days before the fund-raiser. That was difficult, she said, because she feels guilty for being able to walk, for being alive. And she feels guilty for feeling guilty, wishing she could bury her own anguish to help her friends.

She is seeing a therapist, but is still haunted by the facts. “Three of us went,” she said. “And I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital.”

“Mr. Stephen Paddock: I forgive you, sir”

The night of the concert, Pati Mestas, 67, had moved to the front row, where she danced while her friends hung back.

This was typical for Ms. Mestas, who was one of the Go Girls, fans of a country radio station who wore wristbands so they could find each other at shows. She died wearing cowgirl boots and a star-spangled T-shirt.

She had spent most of the past 15 years living with her son Jeremy Schmidt, his wife and their four children. She was the one who sneaked the little ones candy, who let them watch what they wanted on television.

After the shooting, Mr. Schmidt raced to Las Vegas, unsure if his mother was alive. His youngest daughter, age 8, kept asking her mother: “Did Dad find Nana?”

When Mr. Schmidt returned, he wrote in a Facebook post what he had told his daughter:

What I won’t do is harbor hate in my heart for the man who did this senseless act of violence.

I will not allow my kids to let hate grow in their hearts for this man.

He was so troubled that he thought ruining other people’s lives was the answer.

Ms. Mestas’s three children, eight grandchildren, one great-grandchild, two brothers and many cousins set her funeral for Saturday, Oct. 28, at a memorial home guarded by a statue of Jesus leading his flock.

Ms. Smith said she planned to attend.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015.
Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.
Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.
For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months.","The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trump’s Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts. He fits the mold of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street. While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.

Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law. Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.

A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.

His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode. Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.

On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn’s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration’s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.

“Justin’s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration’s top domestic priority,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.

Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump’s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush’s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a “territorial” tax system, as the current plan would also do.

“What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he’s just a policy wonk,” Mr. Bush said in an interview. “Justin has a desire to serve and he’s getting to do it at a high level, and I’m really proud of him for doing it.”

Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve. Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of “America First.” In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.

Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the “outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.”

Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes. In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.

He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinich’s conservative leanings were obvious at an early age. Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.

Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds. His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends. A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.

While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.

“I think that he is pragmatic,” said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department. “He’s looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.”

Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach. Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchin’s promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create. The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretary’s analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.

Yet Mr. Muzinich’s reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“I’m really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later,” said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.

For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months. Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.

The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.

“I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, ‘Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us,’” Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said. “I think people should be caring about other people.”",The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/the-little-known-pragmatist-who-is-shaping-the-trump-tax-cuts.html

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

IRELAND Tuam Dublin GALWAY

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abcess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html

Most shows from the ’90s T.G.I.F. lineup are available, in full, on Hulu, but the only one likely to surprise anyone is “Dinosaurs,” one of those shows that was so out of left field, it’s hard to believe it got made at all. The show included massive dinosaur puppets and a throwback sitcom structure, but with trenchant commentary on sexism and environmentalism. There are 65 half-hour episodes, which feels like enough.

Although they weren’t a part of T.G.I.F., “Major Dad” and “Home Improvement” both feel as if they could have been. They’re both consistent and mild and family-friendly (though the sexual politics are decidedly of their era).

“Roseanne,” available in full on Amazon Prime, had an inglorious end game, but in its first seven-ish seasons, it’s one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. It’s also astoundingly ageless: The jokes work just as well today because the humor is almost all character-driven and not reference driven. It’s one of very few shows that focus on the ordinary needs of a working-class family, and it also frankly addresses abuse and childhood trauma. “Roseanne” is even better than you remember. (Again, not after Season 7.)

Also: This was the way to have a sitcom in the ’90s. Obviously there’s “Seinfeld,” available on Hulu and Crackle, and there’s “The Larry Sanders Show,” available on HBO Go. Ellen DeGeneres’s eventually groundbreaking “Ellen” is available on Hulu. And there’s Brett Butler’s “Grace Under Fire,” available on Amazon Prime. It’s not quite one of the greats, but it’s pretty good, especially if you’re in the market for a show that talks openly about sobriety and recovery.

The aliens-come-to-earth sitcom “3rd Rock,” now on Amazon Prime, never had the ratings or the buzz of its network brethren, but that makes it even more ripe for a rewatch — it feels new all over again.

Kristen Johnston won two Emmys for her work on the show, but she should have won a hundred.

Also: NBC ensemble comedies defined ’90s TV, and frankly ’80s TV and some of 2000s TV, too.

Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work. Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions. While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself. We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about. But do they also think better?

Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure. For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.

During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday. Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.

Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour. The exercise was gentle — a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling — and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks. They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.

The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.

Gregory Porter, ‘Nature Boy’

Gregory Porter’s new album “Nat King Cole and Me” pays tribute to one of his strongest influences. With its hearth-like comforts and flawless elocution, Cole’s voice is almost quintessentially dated. But Mr. Porter manages to embody some of the same principles — poise, savvy, listener validation — while punching it up with some contemporary solemnity and world-weariness. On “Nature Boy,” Cole’s signature song, the swarming and enchanting string arrangements of Vince Mendoza echo those on the original 1948 recording, though they’re more abundant. After a climactic interlude, Mr. Porter repeats the song’s famous catch phrase one last time, his voice now measured and low: “The greatest thing you’ll ever learn/Is just to love and be loved in return.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Brian Eno and Kevin Shields, ‘Only Once Away My Son’

How did this team-up take so long to happen? Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and the producer-songwriter-conceptualist Brian Eno both cherish the resonant, the amorphous, the unmoored, the immersive, the destabilizing. “Only Once Away My Son,” an instrumental, has a deceptive opening, with an urgent drum-and-cymbal beat that soon evaporates. The rest blends tinkly bell tones and almost subliminally soothing low notes with what must be Mr. Shields’s swaths of hovering tremolo guitar: freneticism that begins on a far horizon, draws close and lingers, menacingly, before finding what sounds more like respite than resolution.

Clean Bandit Featuring Julia Michaels, ‘I Miss You’

Sometimes Julia Michaels sings like she’s choking on the words, as if she’s turning away from them as soon as they escape from her mouth. On “I Miss You,” an affecting collaboration with the austere British dance-pop outfit Clean Bandit, she’s at her most forlorn: “You weren’t a fan of pictures, so I hardly ever took ‘em/Got ‘em saved in my mind from the bedroom/So that way I can’t forget your skin.” JON CARAMANICA

Rhye, ‘Taste’

The elusive R&B group Rhye , led by the singer Milosh, reappears with the insinuating “Taste,” a bedroom whisper — “I’m not awake, I’m not alone” — delivered in a perfectly androgynous falsetto. It’s got a subdued funk pulse hinting at Sly and the Family Stone’s “Family Affair,” interlaced with burbling chamber-pop woodwinds; it never gets anywhere near too pushy. J.P.

The Weather Station, ‘You and I (on the Other Side of the World)’

Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian songwriter who leads the Weather Station, sings as if she’s spent a lot of time pondering her way toward complicated conclusions. “You and I (on the Other Side of the World)” is a folk-rock meditation exploring the mysteries of an enduring marriage: “More intimate than I could imagine/But with space I cannot fathom.” The music harks back to the late 1960s, mostly clinging to two chords as string arrangements rise and subside in the background, mirroring hopes and uncertainties.

Snoh Aalegra Featuring Logic, ‘Sometimes’

The slow-and-low hip-hop-soul saunter of 1995-97 finds new life in “Sometimes,” one of the standout songs from the impressive new Snoh Aalegra album “FEELS.” On this song, she floats somewhere between neo-soul — its original incarnation — and trip-hop, singing breathily and with purpose. A slickly sneering verse from Logic adds acid and bite. J.C.

Sleigh Bells, ‘And Saints’

So long, power chords. “And Saints,” from a coming EP titled “Kid Kruschev,” sets aside Sleigh Bells’ usual drums-and-guitar bravado for a different minimal configuration: just motoric bass notes and high, filmy synthesizer tones enfolding Alexis Krauss’s distraught voice and elusive tidings: “Temple throb, dust lakes/Black gold, tigers and saints.” Whatever she's going through is more than a headache.

Kap G Featuring Lil Baby, ‘Pull Up’

Kap G is one of hip-hop’s underrated melodists. He sing-raps with a slur, leaving his vocals round and a little fuzzy. “Pull Up” plays to his strengths — he sounds woozy, sweet, a little distant, easing between tight clusters of words and dreamy smeared syllables. Behind him, the beat — produced by Young TT & Squat Beats — tinkles and creeps while Kap G elegantly swerves. J.C.

John McNeil and Mike Fahie, ‘Can Do’

Here’s an item on the list of “things we don’t see a lot of anymore” in jazz: a close rapport between two musicians, forged on the jam session stage, week after week over a series of years. But that’s what John McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mike Fahie, a trombonist, have developed. They spent roughly a decade leading sessions at watering holes around New York, mentoring younger musicians and deepening a repertoire. Still, for their debut album together, “Plainsong,” they’ve put the focus on their original compositions, not standard fare. The tunes are harmonically snaked and rhythmically relentless; they highlight the horn players’ teasing interplay, and keep the stellar rhythm section — the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Billy Hart — on the move. Mr. McNeil and Mr. Fahie wrote the uptempo “Can Do” together, and it’s a highlight. G.R.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

UNPLUGGED My Saturday is just my Friday. So Sunday is the day I decompress. If I’m being honest, Sundays are for chilling. I wake up pretty late. I cook, French toast and turkey bacon. I watch “Martin.” I turn my phone off. It’s an energy-drain, scrolling for no particular reason.

WHAT SWAG IS I was born in the South Bronx. I have one brother and three sisters. We lived in shelters and navigating the housing system. My mom made our clothes from scratch. Her father was a tailor. She knew fabrics, she knew texture. “Don’t just go by the brand.” She was big on instilling in us that we were more than what we had in our pockets. She was big on making sure we weren’t Frankensteined together. That’s what swag is.

LIKE STOCKS I watch sales like stocks. I watch them to the point where they practically can’t find the other shoe, which is another reason to go shopping on Sunday, because it’s chill, it’s more relaxed. One of the stores to go to is Scotch & Soda.

Health experts widely agree that most of us should sit less, especially at work. Prolonged sitting has been linked with higher risks for diabetes and heart disease, among other conditions. While treadmill and standing desks have grown in popularity, they provide a clear impact on our health but perhaps not on our work itself. We know that most people type better when they sit still than when they stand up or move about. But do they also think better?

Most studies of prolonged sitting have looked at the benefits from breaking up sitting time on blood sugar and blood pressure. For an innovative new study published recently in The Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, researchers at Arizona State University in Phoenix recruited nine sedentary, overweight men and women and asked them to show up at a simulated office space at the university.

During one visit, the volunteers sat continuously for eight hours (apart from bathroom breaks), while using a computer and talking on the phone, as if it were any workday. Twice during the day, they also completed computerized measures of many thinking skills, including working memory and decision making.

Then, during three other faux workdays, the volunteers broke up their sitting time by variously standing, walking at a treadmill desk or pedaling a modified stationary bicycle placed beneath their desks for at least 10 minutes once an hour. The exercise was gentle — a walking pace of one mile per hour or comparable effort while pedaling — and the volunteers typed and chatted during these breaks. They also repeated the tests of thinking twice each day, immediately after standing or exercising.

The researchers had wondered whether standing or exercising might impair the ability to concentrate and think, much as it did with typing proficiency, says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise and health promotion at Arizona State who oversaw the study.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

For years they had attended country shows together, giddy when they planned each adventure. On Oct. 1, they were just three California grandmothers joining the rest of crowd in singing “God Bless America.”

Then came the crack of gunfire, and they were three panicked women trapped in a killing field.

Pati died.

A bullet hit Kim in the back.

Only Dana emerged unharmed.

So much of the attention in the aftermath of mass shootings has been focused on the gunman and the number left dead in his wake. But the injured who survive carry a special burden. “We all kind of forget that these people have to live with it for the rest of their lives,” said Dr. Bryan Tsao, chair of the neurology department at Loma Linda University Health.

Dr. Tsao is still treating three patients from the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Battered physically and emotionally, none have been able to return to work, he said.

He described the post-shooting process as one of deconstructing old lives and reconstructing new ones.

“Those that I’ve seen that cannot — that cannot stop dwelling on the tragedy of it, on the injustice of it, on their permanent disability — they don’t do well,” he said. “They take the struggle and kind of go down a different road.”

“He took a part of me that I can’t get back”

Ms. Gervais is being treated at Loma Linda, not far from her house, and just four miles from the scene of the San Bernardino attack.

On Day 19 of her recovery, she was in her hospital room, in the wheelchair, wearing a neck brace and thick compression socks. A humidifier puffed mist above her head. Her daughter Amber Manka, 30, stood by with her own two children.

Ms. Gervais, 56, runs a business servicing trash compactors. She spends — or spent — her weekends riding ATVs in the desert, wearing leather gloves and a full-face helmet. When her husband, a sprint car racer, died after a crash, she raised her two girls on her own.

She had lived a difficult life, she said, which steeled her for challenges. But even for her, this was a lot. “I’m disgusted,” she said of the gunman. “I’m angered, I have all kinds of emotions toward him. Because he took a part of me that I can’t get back.”

She blames her injuries on Mr. Paddock, not the casino or the concert host or gunmakers. “I have nothing against guns. Just him.”

She has no feeling in her legs, and extremely limited use of her arms. Her daughters saw it as a victory when she was able to bend and extend her elbows, something doctors had not expected. She does about three hours of physical therapy a day.

“Why would one person do something like this to people?” she said. “If you’re that unhappy with your life, why hurt others?”

At night, the workers here turn her every few hours, to prevent bedsores. And sometimes she wakes up shaking.

Her daughter, Ms. Manka, has steered the family since the shooting, aided by her husband and younger sister.

She already has anxiety, and when she learned that her mother had been shot, she spent an hour vomiting.

In private, Ms. Manka said she was overwhelmed. “But mostly I just try to keep that away from her,” she said.

At the hospital, a man entered with a clipboard and said he was there to discuss the equipment Ms. Gervais will need when she goes home, which could be weeks or months from now. Among her needs are an expensive wheelchair, a remodeled bathroom, a new car, a nurse, and a way to run her business and pay her mortgage.

“You know,” he said, looking at the women, “your insurance will probably not cover any of this.”

Many families caught in mass attacks have found it difficult to pay for or get the care they need. Insurance companies put up fights. Donations run out.

After the San Bernardino shooting, the county repeatedly denied or delayed coverage to survivors, leaving people without the medicines, therapy and health aides their doctors said they needed.

Ms. Gervais would have to figure out the money later. For now, Ms. Manka used her right arm to spoon butter noodles into her mother’s mouth and her left to hold her daughter on her hip.

“Can I have some milk?” Ms. Gervais said.

Her daughter smiled and held the straw to her mother’s lips.

“I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital”

That night, a friend of Ms. Gervais had arranged a bingo fund-raiser to help pay for some of the costs. Collections from a GoFundMe page the family had started would barely cover the wheelchair.

Two hundred people crowded into an elementary school cafeteria, where a large sign bore the school motto: “No Excuses at Sky Country.”

“O-72!” said the bingo announcer.

At a lunch table in the back sat Dana Smith, the only one of the three women to make it out unscathed. She wore a blue shirt that matched her blue eyes.

Ms. Smith, 52, had known both Kim and Pati for more than 20 years, and was the one who had brought them all together.

In the weeks since the shooting, she had left the house three times, she said. She does not sleep or eat much, and spends time watching videos of that night, as if to remind herself it was real.

Some days she gets out of bed. “Wednesday I didn’t,” she said. “It was like I didn’t care. There was nothing to get me going.”

She has not returned to her job as an aide at a high school, because she is worried that the popping of milk cartons, a student prank, will throw her into a panic.

Melissa Strassner can relate. She was 14 in 1999, when two of her classmates went on a killing spree at Columbine High School. She watched them shoot her friend Anne Marie Hochhalter, and six months after the school shooting, Anne Marie’s mother killed herself.

“I felt like it had been my fault,” Ms. Strassner said. “If I had not run away from her, maybe she would not have been paralyzed, maybe her mother wouldn’t have made the decision she made.”

“You’re never going to be the person you were the day before the shooting,” she added. “You have to mourn the loss of that person.”

Ms. Smith had visited Ms. Gervais a few days before the fund-raiser. That was difficult, she said, because she feels guilty for being able to walk, for being alive. And she feels guilty for feeling guilty, wishing she could bury her own anguish to help her friends.

She is seeing a therapist, but is still haunted by the facts. “Three of us went,” she said. “And I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital.”

“Mr. Stephen Paddock: I forgive you, sir”

The night of the concert, Pati Mestas, 67, had moved to the front row, where she danced while her friends hung back.

This was typical for Ms. Mestas, who was one of the Go Girls, fans of a country radio station who wore wristbands so they could find each other at shows. She died wearing cowgirl boots and a star-spangled T-shirt.

She had spent most of the past 15 years living with her son Jeremy Schmidt, his wife and their four children. She was the one who sneaked the little ones candy, who let them watch what they wanted on television.

After the shooting, Mr. Schmidt raced to Las Vegas, unsure if his mother was alive. His youngest daughter, age 8, kept asking her mother: “Did Dad find Nana?”

When Mr. Schmidt returned, he wrote in a Facebook post what he had told his daughter:

What I won’t do is harbor hate in my heart for the man who did this senseless act of violence.

I will not allow my kids to let hate grow in their hearts for this man.

“There is going to be an enormous crush of borrowers who think they are eligible only to find that they are not,” said Seth Frotman, the student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which published a report on the subject in June. “We need to get ready for it.”

All Mr. Shafer has been trying to do for more than 25 years is get ready for a career where he could make a difference while also earning enough to buy a home and help raise a family. The son of a fisherman and a mother who eventually became a teacher herself, Mr. Shafer, 46, does indeed own a cozy house on a street with gorgeous foliage. He and his wife live with their two sons, ages 10 and 4.

At work, Mr. Shafer offers job interview advice to one student while plotting financial aid application strategies with another. The classroom where he and his colleagues work has notices on the walls about housing and a free Thanksgiving dinner.

But at home over the last two years, he has spent many hours communicating with his current loan servicer, FedLoan, which is part of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. Eventually, he contacted elected officials and the Department of Education’s ombudsman department. The fact that he has had more than one servicer is a big part of what seems to have gone wrong.

As Mr. Shafer tells it, teacher circles were abuzz back in 2007 when the federal public service loan forgiveness program came into existence. Five years earlier, he had consolidated all of his student loans into a single one. At the time, his servicer verified his income and put him into a repayment plan where his payments would grow slowly over time, presumably as his income grew.

In 2007, Mr. Shafer said, he called his servicer at the time, ACS Education Services, and told the company that he wanted to enroll in the public service loan forgiveness program. No problem, he said he had been told, as long as he made his payments on time for 120 months. When ACS exited the federal loan servicing business, his loan moved to Mohela, short for the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, in 2012. Nothing, he said, that he heard or saw from Mohela gave him pause.

In 2013, he heard this from a fellow teacher: Once borrowers in the public service loan forgiveness program reached 120 payments, only one servicer, FedLoan, could forgive the remaining balance. So Mr. Shafer did what he needed to do to move his loans there.

It was at that point that things began to go off the rails. Remember that repayment program that Mr. Shafer ended up in back in 2002? It is what’s known as a graduated repayment plan, and if you’re in one, you’re not eligible for public service loan forgiveness. He was supposed to be in one of the income-based plans.

All along, Mr. Shafer said, people at the three servicers told him that his loan was in “good status” when he asked whether he was on track for forgiveness in 2017. The phone representatives at these servicers, however, may have been defining that term more narrowly — namely, that he was merely making on-time payments. It’s also possible that they simply didn’t understand the highly specific requirements of the loan forgiveness program.

In 2015, Mr. Shafer received an email from FedLoan that definitively alerted him to the fact that none of his eight years of payments had counted toward forgiveness. He panicked and spent the next year fighting back, flabbergasted that so much time had gone by without any of the three servicers telling him that anything was wrong when he had quite specifically and repeatedly inquired.

Photo

So why didn’t they? A spokesman for ACS’s current owner said it could not comment on the concerns of a past borrower, even though Mr. Shafer granted the company permission to do so. A Mohela spokesman said that while it didn’t have specific records of having told Mr. Shafer that his payments were not qualifying, its phone representative’s contact with him in January 2013 was probably what spurred him to move his loans to FedLoan to become eligible for the forgiveness program. Mr. Shafer said that was not so.

At FedLoan, a spokesman said it had told Mr. Shafer that he had a problem, more than once, by phone and through other communications. Indeed, in Mr. Shafer’s pile of documents, I did find a 2014 statement that said, on the back, that he had not made any qualifying payments. Mr. Shafer had missed that, and many others probably did, too, given that FedLoan didn’t bother to put this crucial piece of information on the front of the bill, let alone in 100-point neon “You are doing this wrong” type.

As for FedLoan’s specific assertion that it disclosed the problem to him by phone in 2013, Mr. Shafer responds with the following: Why on earth would he have not jumped on the problem instantly and aggressively if he had heard that in 2013?

There does not appear to be any happy ending in the offing for Mr. Shafer, and after a year of appeals, he did move himself into an eligible repayment plan. If nothing else happens to mess this all up again, he should finish paying off his loans when he is 55, about the time that his first child starts college. That will be 37 years after he took out his first loan as a teenager.

Worried that your story will end with similar bad news? There are four crucial requirements in the public service loan forgiveness program. You have to be in an eligible job, with an eligible loan, making the right kind of payments (which was what tripped Mr. Shafer up) and doing so in the right way. A column I wrote in April outlines the process, even if conquering it proves to be another matter.

Mr. Shafer remains baffled by it all. Perspiring at his dining room table this week after a meal of halibut that he had caught himself, he sipped a second adult beverage and tried to understand what had happened. In what other area of life, he wondered aloud, would you pay your bills on time only to be told that the payments hadn’t counted?

Later on in the week, he put it like so: “They have the power, regardless of my service and full payments, to make me look inept. Though I have been working hard for 18 years to help young people graduate from high school and build a viable future — and have been sending a large chunk of my paycheck back to the very government I work for — they will surely win based on their documentation.”

So this is who we are now. For all sorts of reasons that made perfect sense at the time, we built additional repayment programs onto existing complexity onto well-meaning forgiveness overseen by multiple layers of responsible parties. And once that was done, Mr. Shafer, teacher of shelter dwellers and street kids and others whom fellow educators failed to reach, wasted a small fortune and will now shovel another one into the federal coffers.

Adding to the political headwinds, two of the Republican lawmakers most interested in drafting a new war authorization law are lame ducks and estranged from the White House: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has proposed a new war authorization bill with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Both Republican senators, who have announced that they will not seek re-election, have publicly denounced Mr. Trump in recent weeks as dangerously unfit to be the commander in chief.

But as the 9/11 war enters its 17th year, questions about the scope and limits of presidential war-making powers are taking on new urgency.

Mr. Trump is giving the Pentagon and the C.I.A. broader latitude to pursue counterterrorism drone strikes and commando raids away from traditional battlefields. Two government officials said Mr. Trump had recently signed his new rules for such kill-or-capture counterterrorism operations, without major changes to an interagency agreement first described last month by The New York Times.

Under the Obama-era rules, there was individualized high-level vetting of proposed strikes, and targets had to pose a specific threat, as individuals, to Americans. Under the new Trump rules, the administration will instead approve a “persistent campaign of direct action” for various countries where Islamist militants are operating, without higher-level review of particular strikes, and targets may include any suspected member of a group deemed covered by the 9/11 war authorization.

And while the Trump administration decided to keep an Obama-era requirement of “near certainty” that no civilians would be killed, it reduced the required level of confidence that the intended target was present in a strike zone from “near certainty” to “reasonable certainty,” one official said — further lowering constraints on attacks.

Moreover, NBC News reported this past week that the Trump administration was exploring arming the surveillance drones that now fly over Niger and Mali in search of suspected Islamist militants. The new rules could also permit the Pentagon to carry out offensive ground combat operations in North and West Africa, escalating deployments that key lawmakers seem to have been only dimly aware of before the deaths of the four soldiers this month.

“I didn’t know there was a thousand troops in Niger,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Mr. Graham opposes rewriting the 9/11 war authorization law but wanted more information about what the government is doing with it, saying: “This is an endless war without boundaries, no limitation on time and geography. You got to tell us more.”

The questions about Mr. Trump’s interpretation of his war powers range beyond conventional counterterrorism operations.

For example, Mr. Trump has suggested that he may abandon diplomatic efforts to curb North Korea’s testing of nuclear bombs and longer-range missiles and order an attack. But he and his administration have said nothing suggesting that they would seek prior authorization from Congress and the United Nations Security Council.

On April 6, Mr. Trump ordered airstrikes against Syrian government forces as punishment for using chemical weapons, without going to Congress or the United Nations for permission. His administration refused to answer questions about why it thought he had lawful authority to carry out such an act of war unilaterally, especially as a matter of international law, leaving it unclear whether it had first considered potential legal constraints.

A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently revealed that Mr. Trump’s legal team did draft and internally circulate a seven-page, unsigned memo analyzing a legal basis for potential military action against Syria. While the memo is undated, Justice Department lawyers said it was probably produced on April 6, the day of the strikes.

But the administration is keeping the memo’s contents secret, so it is not clear what, if anything, it says about international law. The United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United States, forbids attacking another sovereign country without Security Council permission or a self-defense claim.

It is also not clear whether the memo’s analysis of domestic law claimed constitutional power for Mr. Trump to lawfully attack Syria merely because he decided that it would be in the national interest — as a set of leaked administration talking points maintained — or whether it invoked the 9/11 war authorization law as purported congressional sanction.

But in June, after the United States military shot down a Syrian government fighter jet — prompting Russia to threaten to shoot down any American aircraft that flew west of the Euphrates River — the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., asserted that the executive branch’s legal authority to attack the Syrian jet came from the 9/11 war authorization law.

General Dunford’s rationale was that the American presence in Syria stemmed from its fight against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State under that law, and that the jet had been menacing a rebel militia the United States was supporting. Several lawmakers and witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in June on whether to replace the 9/11 war authorization law criticized his claim as stretching the 2001 law too far.

The existence of the April 6 memo came to light via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group founded by former Obama administration lawyers. On Thursday, the group filed a new lawsuit for documents that could similarly reveal whether the Trump administration has developed any analysis about a legal basis for a potential pre-emptive attack on North Korea.

Protect Democracy’s executive director, Ian Bassin, said the Senate should ask the top Trump administration witnesses on Monday to explain their understanding of Mr. Trump’s powers to unilaterally start or expand wars beyond those linked to the much-stretched 9/11 war authorization law.

“Senator Corker may be worried about the lack of adult day care in the White House, but the framers actually assigned those duties to Congress,” Mr. Bassin said, invoking the chairman’s rejoinder to Mr. Trump’s insults on Twitter earlier this month. “With a commander in chief unilaterally launching missiles at Syria and threatening nuclear war against North Korea, Corker needs to focus on more than an Islamic State A.U.M.F. He needs to put safety bumpers around the president.”",Will Congress Ever Limit the Forever-Expanding 9/11 War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/aumf-congress-niger.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might.","A retirement crisis already looms. Three out of four Americans worry that they will not have enough money to get through their retirements, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. About 45 percent have not saved a cent toward it.

Mr. Trump, sensitive to the firestorm that could be provoked by limits on 401(k) contributions, tweeted that there would “be NO change” to this “great and popular middle class tax break” — before conceding it might be a part of legislative horse-trading.

Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the principal Republican architect of the tax plan in the House, also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings.

“All the focus is on, can we help people save more,” he said.

Yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.

First, the debate on Capitol Hill is not really about retirement; it’s about lawmakers’ feverish hunt for revenue to finance tax cuts. Second, no matter what happens, it won’t solve the fundamental problem — that many Americans will outlive their savings.

There are several types of subsidized retirement accounts. People who work at larger companies tend to set aside money in a 401(k); they don’t pay taxes until they withdraw funds. By contrast, Americans who open an account known as a Roth get a different kind of break. They pay tax on money before it is deposited, but then get to withdraw it and the subsequent earnings tax-free in the future.

Details of the Republican tax plan have not yet been released, but the talk has been of imposing a cap of $2,400 a year on tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) plans — a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of $18,000 a year for people under 50, and $24,000 for people age 50 and above.

There would still be a tax benefit, but it would probably be under a Roth-style structure.

To some people, enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference. But for Republicans in Washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue, timing is everything.

Their tax bill includes giant reductions in business taxes. Figuring out how to pay for tax cuts is always a grueling task, but it is especially complicated in today’s bitterly partisan atmosphere. Republican lawmakers intend to push through a bill without any Democratic support — but there is a catch. The single-party strategy in this case triggers a rule that requires the policy to have no impact on the budget at the end of 10 years. To make the math work, lawmakers need to come up with the revenue to pay for the cuts sooner rather than later.

That’s where 401(k)’s come in. Rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments, the Republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts. That’s the equivalent of a middle-class tax increase.

“It’s just an enormous budget gimmick,” said William Gale of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “It’s raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts. This is not a retirement security story.”

The accounting sleight-of-hand irks Mr. Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush, because, he says, it is financially irresponsible. “It’s just government borrowing by another name,” he said. “You’re not really raising revenue,” just changing when it’s collected.

The question of whether deferring taxes on retirement savings is actually good policy, however, is a separate matter.

Tax-subsidized retirement accounts have long roused fans and critics. Budget cutters point to the trillions of dollars they cost the Treasury Department. Groups concerned about growing inequality complain that the tax break primarily benefits higher-income Americans who would save for retirement anyway. Those with more modest salaries generally have less access to work-based plans or can’t afford to save. Consumer advocates worry they are too vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market.

Still, these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upper-income voters and many of the politicians who represent them — which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed.

Whether a tax-deferred 401(k) or a Roth is a better deal is not clear. Younger workers starting out can reasonably assume they are in a lower tax bracket now and benefit from a Roth, while middle-age workers may assume they will be in a lower bracket after they retire. But mostly there are question marks. Who knows if Congress will raise or lower tax rates 30 years from now, or if someone will shift from a higher tax bracket to a lower one? (It wouldn’t be the first time taxes on retirement income changed — Social Security benefits were shielded from federal income taxes for decades before the law changed in 1983.)

Mr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might. So does Mr. Benna, the 401(k)’s inventor. Although he says the tax deferral alone — without employers matching some of their employees’ contributions — was probably insufficient to persuade lower-wage workers to participate, it has nudged up middle-class savings. “It’s harder to save the same amount after taxes,” he said. “There will be a drop-off in contributions.”

But other experts aren’t so sure.

Andrew Biggs, formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said that for most people, it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future. Automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes, said Mr. Biggs, now a retirement specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

Some studies have confirmed his hunch. One team of researchers looked at a handful of companies that offered a tax-deferred savings plan and then added a Roth option to the menu. They found the total amount of contributions didn’t change much. “The tax deduction was a pretty minor force,” said James Choi, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management and a part of that team.

And depending on future tax law, Mr. Choi said that retirees with Roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401(k)’s because they won’t have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw.

The possibility that people may save less overall is fueling financial services industry opposition to the tax proposal currently in Congress. Plan administrators — which include major mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group — are paid a share of the assets under their control; if the assets shrink, so do their fees.

What worries Mr. Choi, though, is the Republicans’ idea to cap the amount of tax-deferred contributions at $2,400 a year, while treating the rest like Roth contributions.

Setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations, he said. From that perspective, it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling.

Yet whether the 401(k) caps are untouched, slashed or abandoned altogether, the prospect remains that millions of Americans will face retirement with no savings.",Limit on 401(k) Savings?

Helsinki’s Best Public Saunas: A Guide

Finnish culture revolves around the sauna. Historically, saunas were where Finns brewed their beer, washed their laundry and cured their hams; where babies were born, the sick were healed and the dead were prepared for burial.

Today, Finland has more than three million saunas for its 5.5 million people — and the sauna is where all serious conversations about work, sex, relationships, politics and faith take place. “Finnish people are bit shy in general, but somehow open up at a sauna when surrounded by strangers,” says Tanja Aromaki, general manager of the Lonna spa, which runs during the summer on Lonna Island, just off the Helsinki mainland.

As the cold months draw near, here are some of the capital’s best public options for stripping down and sweating like a local.

Sauna Arla

As Finnish people moved from rural forested areas into the city during the industrialization of the 1920s and 1930s, few apartments had hot water or showers, so people bathed at public saunas. Although this trend has reversed — almost every building now has its own sauna facilities — there are a handful of public saunas from the era still operating, and gas-and-wood-fired Sauna Arla , established in 1929 and offering massage, cupping and backwashing, is one of the city’s most iconic.

“In the sauna there is strange peace in its darkness and warmness,” says the spot’s owner-manager, Kimmo Helisto. “You don’t need to talk too much — you can face yourself and think about your own things.”

Kaurilan Sauna

Another of Helsinki’s wood-stove saunas, Kaurilan , operates in a 19th-century log cabin. It was originally located in nearby Tuusula but was moved to the leafy Old Meilahti neighborhood in 1995. Its owner, Saara Lehtonen, who makes her own sauna linens and organic cosmetics in an adjacent workshop, says she has seen a recent uptick in Finns seeking the social and spiritual aspect of the shared sauna experience. “Public saunas have always been a place where your status has no meaning and everyone is welcome to relax and enjoy the beautiful, unique and sacred atmosphere a sauna can offer,” she says.

Loyly

“Key things for a good sauna are that it’s wood heated, it has a big enough stove and it has enough fresh air,” says Eemeli Nurminen, general manager of the sleek, architecturally striking Loyly , named for the untranslatable Finnish word which encapsulates the sound, heat and moisture of splashing water on a hot stove. Owned by the Finnish TV star Jasper Paakkonen and member of parliament Antero Vartia, it offers coed steam and smoke saunas heated by 7,000-kg stoves. Since it opened in May 2016, it has become a popular day-into-night hangout — you’ll often spot Finnish notables at the bar and on the breezy terrace.

Finnish Sauna Society

The Finnish Sauna Society was established in 1937 to foster the heritage and health benefits of the national bath. Today, its oceanfront clubhouse offers six wood-fired saunas and four savusaunas (smoke saunas) for its 4,200 members and their guests, plus personal washing and massage services. The society awards grants to members keen to undertake sauna-related studies and its regular seminars are a great introduction to sauna culture — including lessons on the mythology surrounding sauna elves, gnomes and trolls who enjoy the last of the steam once the humans have gone.

Sauna Hermanni

Located in its eponymous neighborhood, Sauna Hermanni opened to serve the surrounding apartments in 1953. Its owner, Mika Ahonen, strives to maintain the aesthetic of that time — there are retro wood-paneled sauna walls and locker rooms displaying contemporary photos and magazines and hosting regular D.J. nights, poetry readings and barbecues. Pass by and you’ll find visitors of all ages cooling off outside with a lemonade and a herring sandwich, even in the dead of winter. “Most people comes after work or study and stay two to three hours,” Ahonen says. “They can hang around as long they want; we don’t have time limits.”

Kotiharjun Sauna

Serving patrons since 1928, the family-owned Kotiharjun is one of Helsinki’s longest-running public saunas and one of its most relaxed. There’s no need to book a spot — and you can stay as long as you like. You can also buy your own vihtu (birch switch) with which to whack yourself — it’s supposed to improve circulation — or indulge in a washing experience with massage, reflexology and acupressure. Between steam sessions, saunagoers grab a towel and beer and chill — literally — on the street outside.

Uunisaari

Tiny beach-ringed Uunisaari Island, a two-minute ferry ride from Helsinki pier, has a nostalgia-tinged, Old World holiday feel that speaks to its long history as an urban escape. “Even in the 19th century, Uunisaari had a famous seaside bathhouse,” says its head of operations, Outi Gummerus. While red-brick Restaurant Ugn and the island’s barbecue spots and beaches are open to the public year-round, its two upscale wood-shack saunas and outdoor whirlpool are only for exclusive use, except on Sundays, when you can purchase a public ticket and relax on the terrace between sessions with harbor views, cocktails and live music.

Kulttuurisauna

Established in 2013 by the designer Nene Tsuboi and the architect Tuomas Toivonen to enhance the city’s public bath options, this wood-heated sauna takes its stylistic cues from the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who was also a sauna fan. Quite a few rules are upheld to retain the sauna’s sense of sanctuary: no reservations, no private parties, no groups, no alcoholic drinks and no swimwear — Finns don’t want swimming-pool chlorine vaporizing in the heat — although you’re welcome to don a suit when mingling on the harborfacing coed deck.

Saunas at Yrjonkatu Swimming Hall

When it opened in 1928, Yrjonkatu was Finland’s only public swimming hall — and remained so for several decades. Now, the grand building — reopened following an extensive two-year renovation in 1999 — speaks to the classic architecture of the time. In addition to a 25-meter lap pool, Yrjonkatu offers multiple electric wood-heated public and private, single gender and coed saunas over several floors. 011-358-9-310-87401

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan.
“She put her arms around me.”But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team.
Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others).
As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered.","She said she told her lawyer to pull the offer within a day of The New York Times publishing an article that detailed decades of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment, aggression and misconduct toward women, as well as at least seven other settlements he had reached with accusers. After that, the dam burst, with The New Yorker, The Times and other news outlets reporting on dozens of other women’s experiences with Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein, his accusers say, built his long history of abusing women on a risky gamble that worked for him over and over — the assumption that money or threats could buy women’s silence on a subject so intimate and painful that most would prefer not to go public anyway. While Ms. McGowan was the rare voice suggesting that the cover-up was not fail-safe, even she considered not naming him, having already, she believes, paid a career price for that long-ago episode and its aftermath.

A Weinstein spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said that “Mr. Weinstein unequivocally denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex.” Ms. McGowan’s lawyer, Paul Coggins, confirmed that Ms. McGowan received the offer.

By 2015, Ms. McGowan, who felt alienated by the industry, started using her sizable platform on Twitter to maximize her status as both insider and outsider — someone with enough Hollywood experience to speak with authority about sexism within it, and someone liberated enough from its compromises to unleash the fury in her that had been building for years. Only now does the scope of the news about Mr. Weinstein — and the public conversation about what’s wrong with Hollywood — seem to match the scale of her outrage, giving her the clout of a contrarian at last proven right.

On Friday, at the inaugural Women’s Convention in Detroit, she was a featured speaker — a new, combative face of feminism, endowed with Hollywood charisma yet anything but slick. “I have been silenced for 20 years,” she told the gathering. “I have been slut-shamed. I have been harassed. I have been maligned. And you know what? I’m just like you.”

A Crusade Gathers Strength

As other women told their stories in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan not only addressed what happened to her but also attacked those she considered complicit.

When the actor Ben Affleck claimed he never knew of Mr. Weinstein’s history, she wrote in a tweet: “‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face,” adding, “The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.” (Mr. Affleck declined to comment.) She called out the larger apparatus of Hollywood, criticizing talent agencies — “you are guilty of human trafficking,” she wrote — and a film studio that she believed knew of Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misconduct.

When Twitter suspended her account — the company said that it was because she had published a private phone number — users retaliated with a boycott that drew support from celebrities such as the actress Alyssa Milano and the writer Cheryl Strayed. The actor and filmmaker Jordan Peele tweeted, in response to Ms. McGowan’s blistering attacks, a moody still of her from “Grindhouse” in which she surveys burning wreckage her character has wrought. “Get ’em, Rose,” he wrote.

On Oct. 13, the day of the boycott, Ms. McGowan retreated from Los Angeles, where she had been working on her memoir, to a beach cottage in Hawaii, safely ensconced behind two gates, near a park locals call the City of Refuge. “I wanted to come to a place that had so much power to it, that it could hold a lot at bay — a lot of monster energy,” said Ms. McGowan, sitting at a picnic table near the ocean. “I came to a place that almost has a protective zone around it.” Her hair was short, but not shaven, as it had been in the past. Once featured on the covers of Maxim and Rolling Stone as a longhaired, barely dressed object of desire, Ms. McGowan seems to have settled on an aesthetic of chic simplicity.

If not a time of celebration, this moment could be perceived as a moment of vindication for Ms. McGowan. Yes, she said, she sometimes feels like laughing — “kind of like a witch’s cackle,” she clarified. But at other times she feels emotionally raw, just knowing that a click on her phone would bring her to conversations others were having about her assault allegation. The phone had come to feel too powerful: “It’s like a live wire that you’re holding in your mouth, and it goes directly to your brain,” she said.

The Meeting and the Aftermath

Her story of assault, although uniquely her own, shares some of the now familiar hallmarks of a Weinstein encounter. Ms. McGowan, then 23, was in Park City, Utah, in early 1997 to attend the Sundance Film Festival and the screening of a film in which she appeared, “Going All the Way.” She had also recently appeared as a smart-mouthed beauty who dies a gruesome death in the blockbuster film “Scream,” on which Mr. Weinstein was an executive producer.

Ms. McGowan’s manager then, Jill Messick, told her to meet Mr. Weinstein at the restaurant in the Stein Eriksen Lodge for a 10 a.m. appointment. On her arrival, the maître d’ directed the actress upstairs to Mr. Weinstein’s suite, she said. Ms. McGowan remembers passing two male assistants on the way in. “They wouldn’t look me in the eye,” she recalled.

She sat at the far end of a couch as Mr. Weinstein sat in a club chair, and they had a brief business meeting. But on their way out, she said, he interrupted himself to point out that the hotel room had a hot tub. “And then what happened, happened,” said Ms. McGowan, who has described her experience, on Twitter, as rape. “Suffice it to say a door opened and my life changed.”

She declined to share the details of the encounter. “That’s my story to tell,” she said emphatically. But she said that she walked out of the hotel suite and directly into a press event. She remembers fighting back tears, and the conversation with Mr. Affleck. She said she told Ms. Messick, then of Addis-Wechsler & Associates, what had occurred. “She held me,” Ms. McGowan said. “She put her arms around me.”

But in the months to come, Ms. McGowan did not feel supported by her management team. She was referred to a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment and assault cases who, Ms. McGowan said, gave her the impression that filing a criminal charge was hopeless. “She was like, ‘You’re an actress, you’ve done a sex scene, you’re done,’” she recalled.

Anne Woodward, now a manager herself, was a young assistant in Ms. Messick’s office at the time, and was in on many of Ms. Messick’s calls. “I remember that Rose was extremely upset and did not want to settle,” Ms. Woodward said. “She wanted to fight.” No one around her, as Ms. Woodward recalls, supported that instinct. “It was an emotionally shocking way to see a woman being treated,” Ms. Woodward said. “That’s what stuck with me.”

Nick Wechsler, then a principal at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, said that he and his partner, Keith Addis, met with Mr. Weinstein at Ms. Messick’s request and confronted him with Ms. McGowan’s claim. “I remember Harvey saying he was going to get psychiatric treatment or some kind of therapy for his sexual behavior,” Mr. Wechsler said.

Ms. McGowan initially asked for about $25,000, enough money to cover her therapy; by the time she signed the settlement, the amount had been raised to $100,000. Both Ms. Woodward and Ms. McGowan were shocked when, only a few months afterward, Ms. Messick accepted a job working as vice president for development at Miramax, then run by Mr. Weinstein. Ms. Messick did not respond to a request for comment.

At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. McGowan had finally been emerging from the trials of an insecure childhood, with loving but unconventional parents: Her father, said his sister, Rory McGowan, Rose’s aunt, “almost certainly had undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder.” He was the leader of a religious cult in Italy, from which Rose’s grandmother extracted her before she reached middle school. Both parents were hippie intellectuals, members of the counterculture who taught their children to prize independent thinking and buck the system.

Maddie Corman, an actress who befriended Ms. McGowan in the mid-90s, perceived a change in Ms. McGowan after the 1997 episode (she says she was aware of the settlement, but could not recall if she learned it directly from Ms. McGowan or from others). “Rose was never this sweet, simple soul — there was always something ferocious about her,” Ms. Corman said. “After that assault, a light dimmed. I remember her souring on the powers that be. And she became very protective of us. It was sometimes cryptic: Keep your guard up.”

Ms. McGowan’s friends watched as she made choices that surprised them, including beginning a relationship with Marilyn Manson, a controversial rock star and ordained Satanist who has called himself “the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles.” (“I ran away for three years and joined the circus,” Ms. McGowan said of that romantic involvement.) She showed up for the red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1998 in a dress made of tiny beads that left her nearly nude. “That was my first big public appearance after being assaulted,” she said. “And I thought — you want to see a body? I did it with a giant middle finger.”

Camilla Rantsen was also a young actress in Los Angeles who was close to Ms. McGowan, and was aware, only through friends, of what had transpired. “I think some of the people she started surrounding herself with weren’t as great as the people she had before,” said Ms. Rantsen, who is now a writer.

Plenty of young actresses with promising starts see their careers founder for one reason or another. But Ms. McGowan believes that after she finished up work on “Phantoms,” a 1998 film produced by Miramax, her career suffered because collaborations with Weinstein productions were for many years off the table. “And they were doing the kinds of movies that I would be doing,” she said.

She continued to work, on “Charmed” until 2006, but also in independent films. Eventually, she appeared in both of the two films packaged as “Grindhouse,” directed by Robert Rodriguez, with whom she was romantically involved, and by Quentin Tarantino. It was distributed by Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s brother. As the film critic David Edelstein put it in New York, Ms. McGowan played “the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme.” The experience, Ms. McGowan said, left her shattered. “I was really lost at that point,” she said. “I was damaged.”

Shunning ‘Celebrity’

It is impossible to predict how Ms. McGowan’s career path in film would have proceeded had the episode with Mr. Weinstein never occurred. She is an unconventional figure, occasionally provocative and profane, but also sometimes old-fashioned and even formal in spirit. “I never considered myself a celebrity,” she said at one point. “I hate that word. It’s tawdry.”

Ms. McGowan became an increasingly outspoken voice for women mistreated by Hollywood. In 2015, she was dropped from her agency after mocking a casting call that encouraged women to wear push-up bras in auditions. (Her agent had been fired a few days earlier, but the agency did not fight to retain her, as agencies typically do of valued clients.)

In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Renée Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actress’s plastic surgery. “How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?” she wrote, in a direct accusation of the piece’s writer, Owen Glieberman.

“It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses,” said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times. “Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.”

And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim. “You are taking part of someone’s soul,” she said. “It’s happened to me.” Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past.

During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona. She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach. She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half — her book, “Brave,” which will be released by Harper One early next year.

To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news. But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: “I knew we are legion. We are legion.” She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press). “It feels,” Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, “‘like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.’ That’s what the whole experience feels like to me. It’s an intense process.”

Sometimes she feels fresh rage. “But I’ll tell you what I don’t feel anymore,” she said. “Despair.”","Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Last Sunday, he won a commanding majority in parliamentary elections, fueling his hopes of revising the nation’s pacifist Constitution.

This brutal calculus over how to respond to North Korea is taking place in a region where several nations have the material, the technology, the expertise and the money to produce nuclear weapons.

Beyond South Korea and Japan, there is already talk in Australia, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam about whether it makes sense to remain nuclear-free if others arm themselves — heightening fears that North Korea could set off a chain reaction in which one nation after another feels threatened and builds the bomb.

In a recent interview, Henry A. Kissinger, one of the few nuclear strategists from the early days of the Cold War still living, said he had little doubt where things were headed.

“If they continue to have nuclear weapons,” he said of North Korea, “nuclear weapons must spread in the rest of Asia.”

“It cannot be that North Korea is the only Korean country in the world that has nuclear weapons, without the South Koreans trying to match it. Nor can it be that Japan will sit there,” he added. “So therefore we’re talking about nuclear proliferation.”

Such fears have been raised before, in Asia and elsewhere, without materializing, and the global consensus against the spread of nuclear weapons is arguably stronger than ever.

But North Korea is testing America’s nuclear umbrella — its commitment to defend its allies with nuclear weapons if necessary — in a way no nation has in decades. Similar fears of abandonment in the face of the Soviet Union’s growing arsenal helped lead Britain and France to go nuclear in the 1950s.

President Trump, who leaves Nov. 3 for a visit to Asia, has intensified these insecurities in the region. During his presidential campaign, he spoke openly of letting Japan and South Korea build nuclear arms even as he argued they should pay more to support the American military bases there.

“There is going to be a point at which we just can’t do this anymore,” he told The New York Times in March 2016. Events, he insisted, were pushing both nations toward their own nuclear arsenals anyway.

Mr. Trump has not raised that possibility in public since taking office. But he has rattled the region by engaging in bellicose rhetoric against North Korea and dismissing talks as a “waste of time.”

In Seoul and Tokyo, many have already concluded that North Korea will keep its nuclear arsenal, because the cost of stopping it will be too great — and they are weighing their options.

Capability to Build the Bomb

Long before North Korea detonated its first nuclear device, several of its neighbors secretly explored going nuclear themselves.

Japan briefly considered building a “defensive” nuclear arsenal in the 1960s despite its pacifist Constitution. South Korea twice pursued the bomb in the 1970s and 1980s, and twice backed down under American pressure. Even Taiwan ran a covert nuclear program before the United States shut it down.

Today, there is no question that both South Korea and Japan have the material and expertise to build a weapon.

All that is stopping them is political sentiment and the risk of international sanctions. Both nations signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but it is unclear how severely other countries would punish two of the world’s largest economies for violating the agreement.

South Korea has 24 nuclear reactors and a huge stockpile of spent fuel from which it can extract plutonium — enough for more than 4,300 bombs, according to a 2015 paper by Charles D. Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists.

Japan once pledged never to stockpile more nuclear fuel than it can burn off. But it has never completed the necessary recycling and has 10 tons of plutonium stored domestically and another 37 tons overseas.

“We keep reminding the Japanese of their pledge,” said Ernest J. Moniz, chief executive of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and an energy secretary in the Obama administration, noting that it would take years if not decades for Japan to consume its fissile material because almost all its nuclear plants have remained offline since the 2011 Fukushima accident.

China, in particular, has objected to Japan’s stockpile, warning that its traditional rival is so advanced technologically that it could use the material to quickly build a large arsenal.

Analysts often describe Japan as a “de facto” nuclear state, capable of building a weapon within a year or two. “Building a physical device is not that difficult anymore,” said Tatsujiro Suzuki, former deputy chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission.

Japan already possesses long-range missile technology, he added, but would need some time to develop more sophisticated communications and control systems.

South Korea may be even further along, with a fleet of advanced missiles that carry conventional warheads. In 2004, the government disclosed that its scientists had dabbled in reprocessing and enriching nuclear material without first informing the International Atomic Energy Agency as required by treaty.

“If we decide to stand on our own feet and put our resources together, we can build nuclear weapons in six months,” said Suh Kune-yull, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University. “The question is whether the president has the political will.”

In Seoul, a Rising Call for Arms

President Moon Jae-in has been firm in his opposition to nuclear weapons. He insists that building them or reintroducing American ones to South Korea would make it even more difficult to persuade North Korea to scrap its own.

Though Mr. Moon has received high approval ratings since his election in May, his view is increasingly a minority one.

Calls for nuclear armament used to be dismissed as chatter from South Korea’s nationalist fringe. Not anymore. Now people often complain that South Korea cannot depend on the United States, its protector of seven decades.

The opposition Liberty Korea party called on the United States to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea in August after the North tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of reaching the mainland United States.

“If the U.N. Security Council can’t rein in North Korea with its sanctions, we will have no option but to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty,” Won Yoo-chul, a party leader, said in September.

Given the failure of sanctions, threats and negotiations to stop North Korea, South Koreans are increasingly convinced the North will never give up its nuclear weapons. But they also oppose risking a war with a military solution.

Most believe the Trump administration, despite its tough talk, will ultimately acquiesce, perhaps settling for a freeze that allows the North to keep a small arsenal. And many fear that would mean giving the North the ultimate blackmail tool — and a way to keep the United States at bay.

“The reason North Korea is developing a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles is not to go to war with the United States,” said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “It’s to stop the Americans from intervening in armed skirmishes or full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula.”

The closer the North gets to showing it can strike the United States, the more nervous South Koreans become about being abandoned. Some have asked whether Washington will risk the destruction of an American city by intervening, for example, if the North attempts to occupy a border island, as its soldiers have practiced.

For many in South Korea, the solution is a homegrown nuclear deterrent.

“If we don’t respond with our own nuclear deterrence of some kind, our people will live like nuclear hostages of North Korea,” said Cheon Seong-whun, a former presidential secretary for security strategy.

With nuclear weapons of its own, the South would gain leverage and could force North Korea back to the bargaining table, where the two sides could whittle down their arsenals through negotiations, some hawks argue.

But given the risks of going nuclear, others say Seoul should focus on persuading Washington to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons.

“The redeployment of American tactical nuclear weapons would be the surest way” to deter North Korea, Defense Minister Song Young-moo said last month, but he added that it would be difficult to get Washington to agree to that.

In Tokyo, Cautious Debate

The discussion in Japan has been more subdued than in South Korea, no surprise after 70 years of public education about the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

But Japan has periodically considered developing nuclear weapons every decade since the 1960s.

In 2002, a top aide to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister then, caused a furor by suggesting Japan might one day break with its policy of never building, possessing or allowing nuclear arms on its territory.

North Korea has reopened that question.

Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister seen as a potential challenger to Prime Minister Abe, has argued that Japan needs to debate its nuclear policy given the threat from North Korea.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Abe has stopped short of calling for a re-evaluation of the country’s position on nuclear weapons. But he has increased military spending and echoed Mr. Trump’s hawkish position against the North.

Mr. Abe’s administration has already determined that nuclear weapons would not be prohibited under the Constitution if maintained only for self-defense.

The Japanese public is largely opposed to nuclear weapons with polls indicating fewer than one in 10 support nuclear armament.

But Japan’s relations with South Korea have long been strained, and if Seoul armed itself, those numbers could shift.

Some analysts say the discussion is aimed at getting additional reassurance from Washington. “We always do that when we become a little upset about the credibility of the extended U.S. deterrence,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.

Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy, said Japan would rethink its position on nuclear weapons if it suspects the United States would let it down.

“We’re kind of in uncharted waters as far as this goes,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly what the threshold is that will lead the Japanese public’s switch to flip.”",North Korea Rouses Neighbors to Reconsider Nuclear Weapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-japan-south-korea.html

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

Photo

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

But, as Sosnik and others who know him attest, Lockhart is a “wartime general, not a peacetime general” for institutions facing conflict. That’s not to say the troops are always in agreement.

In interviews with about a dozen league and team executives — all of whom refused to speak on the record — several owners seemed pleased with his approach to addressing the anthem controversy, which was to strive for a way for the N.F.L. to appear patriotic while respectful of its players who were kneeling to raise awareness of racism and police brutality toward African-Americans.

But there has been friction. Some owners were upset with a comment by Lockhart a few days after President Trump criticized the league and its players for kneeling during the anthem. Lockhart told reporters that players talking about police brutality is “what real locker room talk is.”

The statement was viewed as a flagrant jab at the president, who had dismissed as “locker room banter” comments he made about forcing himself on women, heard in a video leaked during the campaign.

In a meeting at N.F.L. headquarters the next day, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder confronted Lockhart to tell him his remarks would inflame an already fiery issue.

Lockhart confirmed the exchange, which was first reported by ESPN, but said his goal was to react quickly and forcefully, not to craft the perfect rejoinder.

In interviews, several owners, team executives and league officials said that Lockhart has helped amplify the league’s message, even if they question whether more could have been done to anticipate problems before they turned into crises. The attacks by the president, though, were so unusual that “you can’t dump this at his feet,” one team executive said of Lockhart.

Lockhart said that he understands why the owners are frustrated, but he said his job is to keep pushing the league’s view, and pushing back at those who oppose it.

“That’s why they allow me to sit up there and promote it and defend the narrative that football is a great game, brings great values and it’s a great business,” he said.

The owners’ criticism, he said, “is just part of the job.”

Given the continuing heated debate inside the league on the issue, there is from time to time speculation whether Lockhart is long for the job. But if there is a movement to oust him, it is a quiet one.

At events like the Super Bowl, Lockhart is often within an arm’s reach of the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, the pair a study in contrasts. Goodell is tall, athletic and prim. Lockhart is slumped, stocky and tousled. He was so used to the casual dress style in Silicon Valley that he reluctantly resumed wearing neckties when he joined the button-down N.F.L.

Unlike his boss, who has worked more than four decades at the league office, Lockhart’s links to football are thinner. Growing up in Rockland County, northwest of New York City, he said he rooted for Joe Namath and the Jets, but colleagues remember him more as a baseball fan, with a picture of the 1986 Mets hanging in his West Wing office. In high school, he played basketball, not football.

On Sundays during the season, if Lockhart is not at a stadium, he typically watches games in his Manhattan apartment with his two young children, whom he had with his second wife, Giovanna Gray, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York. (His first marriage, to the television journalist Laura Logan, ended in divorce.)

His political genes developed early.

Dinnertime conversation growing up was more likely to be about politics and journalism than sports. His parents worked in television, and his father was a longtime producer at NBC News. Every four years, the Lockhart family spent the summer wherever the presidential conventions were being held.

His skills in choppy political waters have been put to the test in the month since Trump lashed out at players who did not stand for the national anthem.

From the start of the crisis in late September, Lockhart used tactics he honed in Washington. He has pushed the league’s case repeatedly by reaching out to reporters with statements and near-daily conference calls. Through his bidding, the league has publicized positive things that the players are doing in their communities, promoted the idea that the players and owners are united (despite evidence on the field to the contrary), and tried to avoid addressing the president’s remarks directly.

Some of the tone and messaging of the league’s statements, which Lockhart helped craft, have also been in line with a Democratic progressive, a point some owners, a group that includes several staunch supporters of the president, have not missed. They seemed to seek a “third way,” a famously Clintonian way of compromise.

The league’s initial, 87-word statement, issued the day after the president first attacked the league, came after Goodell, Lockhart and other league executives called owners to sound them out. Most N.F.L. statements are bland, but this one was notable for its directness as well as for what it left out.

Goodell’s statement did not explicitly defend the players’ right to protest during the anthem, or even mention racism, the core issue that started the sitting and kneeling demonstrations last season, but it included an unusually strong rebuttal to the president.

“Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the N.F.L., our great game and all our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities,” it said.

Many owners, including several who are donors to Democratic causes, soon followed with similar statements of their own. But other owners issued statements lamenting the league getting pulled into political debates.

After weeks of back and forth, and owners flirting with requiring players to stand, fewer players are kneeling during the anthem.

Lockhart has kept his assertive posture. In a talk with reporters, he was asked about the president, who said the N.F.L. should force all players to stand for the anthem. “He’s exercising his freedom to speak, and I’m exercising my freedom not to react,” Lockhart replied dryly.

As the N.F.L. and social media have grown, the league has become a lightning rod for a host of social issues, including bullying and domestic violence, that stretches its capacity to control the narrative.

Lockhart began advising the league as a consultant in 2014, after video surfaced showing the former running back Ray Rice knocking out his fiancée in an elevator.

When his predecessor, Paul Hicks, left the N.F.L. at the end of 2015, Lockhart was a logical choice to replace him. Lockhart was interested in returning to New York and, he said, taking on a complex challenge to make the N.F.L. more fleet-footed and assured in responding to controversy. (It is unclear what he is paid, but, according to N.F.L. tax filings, Hicks earned $1.5 million in his last year at the league.)

Lockhart, who worked on political campaigns dating to Jimmy Carter’s re-election bid in 1980, has quickly changed the metabolism in the league’s communications office. When The New York Times published an article last year that compared the N.F.L.’s approach to the concussion crisis to that of the tobacco industry, Lockhart issued a long and detailed rebuttal, and said the league would consider taking legal action. (None has been taken.)

Some reporters are not buying what it is being pushed. Jim Trotter, the president of the Pro Football Writers of America, took exception to Lockhart’s assertion that the league has tried to become more transparent. Lockhart’s conference calls were initially not open to all writers, and Goodell and other top executives have not been made available, he said.

“There’s no question they have been more proactive, and that’s part of Joe Lockhart’s approach to it,” Trotter said. “They will respond to things quicker than in the past. Does that mean it’s accurate? No, but it’s their opinion.”

Still, to a certain extent, he is still seen as a political animal, and a few owners, who by and large lean right, have questioned whether a lifelong Democrat like Lockhart (who sold his house in Washington to former President Barack Obama) was the best person to speak on behalf of the league.

Lockhart said his politics had little to do with his job.

“My work is about making sure that people understand what it is we’re doing, why that is and what impact it is having,” he said. “That’s devoid of a political agenda.

A Trunk Show

Luggage connoisseurs will have a field day at Louis Vuitton’s exhibition, “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez,” which opened Friday at 86 Trinity Place in Lower Manhattan. Previously mounted in Seoul, Paris and Tokyo, the show traces the history of the fashion house, founded in 1854, through letters, photographs, sales ledgers, advertising cards and trunks. Many, many trunks.

Spread across 10 rooms, the trunks are filled with shoes, clothes from the 19th and 20th centuries, hats, books, tea sets, picnic essentials and, in one case, an expandable bed. They offer a leather-trimmed primer on the evolution of travel, from yachting to road trips.

Olivier Saillard, the curator, spent months poring over the Louis Vuitton archives. “I didn’t know he left his family when he was 14 years old,” he said. “He spent two years walking by foot to Paris.”

The brand’s humble beginnings seem remarkable against the backdrop of the Hollywood room, where Louis Vuitton luggage belonging to Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Greta Garbo are on display. An adjacent room is devoted to fanciful collaborations, including an oval-shape bag dreamed up by Rei Kawakubo, a twisted box-clutch from Frank Gehry and a monogrammed skateboard trunk stamped with the red Supreme logo.

There are no suitcases in the final room. Instead, there are dresses worn by celebrities such as Alicia Vikander, Taylor Swift and Madonna, a nod to the house’s shorter history of haute couture.

The exhibition, which is open free to the public through Jan. 8, had a preview party on Thursday with a boldface crowd that included Michelle Williams, Ruth Negga and Zendaya. — VALERIYA SAFRONOVA

Architectural Artworks With Crafty Origins

“Wide Wake,” the artist Sam Moyer’s first exhibition with Sean Kelly gallery in New York features paintings, sculpture and drawings in oil on paper — but my favorite pieces are the large-scale paintings composed of repurposed marble, slate and stone — and fabric that Moyer dyed at her home on the North Fork of Long Island. While the materials are organic and hand-crafted, the resulting works are graphic and architectural. Moyer was inspired by artists like Robert Smithson and Agnes Martin, whose influence she compares to the wake of a boat on the water in the show’s title. “ Wide Wake” by Sam Moyer is on view at Sean Kelly, New York through Dec. 9, 2017. – JAMIE SIMS

Fresh Bedding

Bengt Thornefors and Christoffer Svensson met as designers at Acne Studios in Stockholm in 2006. Later they both spent time in Paris, Thornefors working for Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent, and Svensson at Givenchy. Over the years, they had discussed bedding at length — specifically as they had observed the way friends invested in their homes. “Everyone put so much money into their apartments, and we thought if you buy all these beautiful chairs, kitchens, televisions and put art on the walls, why don’t you invest that kind of luxury into your bedding?” said Thornefors. “The bed is such a large object and we saw so much potential for it to be used differently and with more spirit.”

They began to look at bedding as a fashion piece, with the idea that a bed could be well-dressed, and in the summer of 2016 Magniberg launched their first range. The collection combines unexpected textures and colors with a focus on fabrics — an area in which they are self-confessed super geeks. “We want to give the customer an opportunity to combine textiles such as poplin, mesh, silk, sateen,” said Svensson. “The worst thing in the world is to change your bed sheets, but with our bedding, when you put it together you have something interesting.” $60 – $700, magniberg.com — ELLIE HAY

Geoffrey Chadsey’s Elaborate Drawings

Men in Geoffrey Chadsey’s watercolor pencil drawings are hybrids of fleshy humans and curious beings — all emanating from his imagination. “I’ve been collecting photos of men performing their masculinity for the camera, mostly a stoic kind, often awkward because there is a glimpse of self-consciousness going on,” says the Brooklyn-based artist. “These men are performing selves for an online audience — images of being that are presented to be desired.”

His new show, “Heroes and Secondaries,” at the Boston University Art Galleries marks Chadsey’s first institutional exhibition in a decade. Each element his figures clutch — such as an airplane pillow or an iPhone — contributes to ambiguous narratives Chadsey concocts with meticulous artistry and an unabashed ardor for oddity. “Geoffrey Chadsey: Heroes and Secondaries” is on view through December 10th, Faye G., Jo, and James Stone Gallery at Boston University Art Galleries, College of Fine Arts, www.bu.edu. — OSMAN CAN YEREBAKAN

Missoni Teams Up With Jonas Mekas

Jonas Mekas, the avant-garde filmmaker and founder of Anthology Film Archive, is drawn to unexpected environments. At last year’s Venice Bienniale, for instance, he made enlargements of 32 film stills and exhibited them on the windows of a Burger King. “I prefer people’s places to galleries,” he says. So when Angela Missoni — who is celebrating 20 years as creative director of her family’s label — approached Mekas about collaborating on an installation for Missoni’s Madison Avenue store, he jumped at the opportunity. “Why not?” says Mekas, who is 94 this year. “It’s a challenge.”

For the third year of Missoni’s “Surface Conversion” series, Mekas presents “Blue,Yellow, Red, Purple .” The project, curated by the duo Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, includes a video installation visible through the shop windows, enlarged film stills displayed on light boxes throughout the space, and a special, split-screen version of Mekas’s seminal 1969 film “Walden,” which documents moments from his daily life in New York. “The audio runs simultaneously on both,” says Mekas. “So it becomes a very rich collage of sound and image.”

Much of the footage and many of the stills feature flowers and references to the changing seasons. “It’s very colorful,” Mekas says of Missoni’s clothing. “So the theme of flowers immediately came to mind.” A childhood memory of gathering flowers as a farm boy in Lithuania as well as his observations of flowers in New York were points of reference. “The flowers don’t challenge you, they talk to you,” he says. “It’s all for fun.” 1009 Madison Ave., New York. — MERRELL HAMBLETON

A Book That Takes You Behind New York’s Closed Doors

I have a confession: I love to walk New York’s residential streets at night, and look into the illuminated parlor-level windows of beautiful apartments and townhouses. In a glance, you can tell a lot about an anonymous person’s living room — and their world. A new book, “New York Behind Closed Doors,” by Polly Devlin and the photographer Annie Schlechter, takes my curiosity to a whole new level. It invites you into the homes of more than two dozen New Yorkers who live all over the city. There are maximalists and traditionalists, a Memphis mecca in Chelsea — even a Baptist church-cum-home in Harlem. $27, amazon.com — ISABEL WILKINSON

Extreme Measures

Photo

In 2006, a new president and a new drug cartel both took extreme actions, the consequences of which are still unfolding.

The implosion of Colombian cartels set off a fierce competition in Mexico for control of the drug trade. A new cartel, La Familia Michoacána, broke off from a larger group, then cemented its power by deploying extreme, theatrical violence. Though they principally targeted other cartels, the gruesome attacks shocked Mexico.

That same year, Felipe Calderón won the presidency by a hair. Though monitors approved the vote, his leftist opponent called it illegitimate, and the narrow victory for Mr. Calderón left him without a strong mandate.

Shortly after taking office, the new president declared war on the cartels and sent in the military.

Critics say Mr. Calderón sought to legitimize his presidency through the show of force.

Defenders say he had little alternative. Mexico had been a single-party state and, like most such states, had controlled local officials through patronage and corruption. When that system disappeared, drug cartels filled the vacuum, buying off mayors and judges. Only the military had the firepower and autonomy to take them on.

This began the drug war that has killed tens of thousands of people. But it also created a subtler set of problems now driving more and broader violence.

Short-Term Solutions, Long-Term Problems

Photo

Mr. Calderón adopted the so-called kingpin strategy, in which troops captured or killed cartel leaders. This generated headlines, pleased the United States and could be accomplished top-down, with little input from corrupt or weak local law enforcement.

But this short-term solution to the drug war deepened long-term problems.

In bypassing mayors and governors because Mexico’s pre-democratic practices had left them systemically corrupt and unaccountable, the government further reduced their accountability.

And in bypassing already weak local police and judges, the government allowed those institutions to atrophy, with money and political attention diverted to military and federal forces instead.

Murder rate per 100,000 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016 15 10 5 0 18.7 1998 2007 2011 2016

Reforms, desperately needed to fix outdated practices — 24-hour police shifts, poor evidentiary standards, a rule that forbids most police officers from conducting investigations — drifted.

As the kingpin strategy fractured the cartels, smaller groups rose in their place.

Since then, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst, “there has been a significant change in the way organized crime works in Mexico.”

Drug trafficking required resources and infrastructure that the new groups lacked, leading many to turn to kidnapping, theft and extortion. Predatory crimes spiked.

Ordinary Mexicans, once bystanders to the conflict, became its targets at a moment when the state had left them vulnerable.

“In the process of that fragmentation, we didn’t do the job of structuring the institutions of the police forces,” said Mr. Valdés, who ran the civil national security intelligence service as this was unfolding. “So we have the worst of the worst.”

‘The Key Point of Failure’

Photo

The solution to the problem would seem obvious. Strong police and prosecutors, overseen by politicians who are held accountable by voters, could close the vacuum in which gangs and corrupt officials flourish.

Instead, disorder and violence have risen.

Joy Langston, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City, traces many of the country’s woes to a seemingly minor quirk in its political system.

All candidates are selected by the party, and officials serve one term before being shuffled off to another post.

During the one-party era, this was meant to impose accountability, which flowed from party leadership. Oversight institutions, seen as superfluous, never fully developed.

Democracy, as intended, undercut the party’s once all-encompassing power. But the old system built around the assumption of a strong central authority remains in place.

This has weakened the state while cementing many of its old problems, creating what Ms. Langston called a “nightmare scenario” in which “the institutions of accountability and transparency are extraordinarily weak even after 17 years of democracy.”

For example, voters have little opportunity to kick out bad leaders or reward good ones, giving officials little incentive to push through difficult reforms. And criminal groups are able to fill the pockets of notoriously underpaid policemen and other civil servants — often providing the wrong kind of incentives.

“At the end of the day, this is all an issue of accountability,” Mr. Hope said. “That is the key point of failure in Mexico.”

“Nothing happens if a police officer does not do their work,” he added. “Nothing happens if a mayor fails to transform local law enforcement. Nothing happens if a governor fails to invest in prosecutorial services. Nothing happens.”

A Frail State Recedes

Though recent electoral changes will allow some officials to stand for re-election in 2021, deeper problems are taking root.

As public outrage over corruption rises, party leaders, seeing their own careers in peril, are becoming more reluctant to risk pushing for change.

“I cannot think of a single prosecutor or judge who stands out” on fighting corruption, said Paul F. Lagunes, a Columbia University professor who studies corruption.

“There are people staking their careers on this, but not in the judiciary — in the press,” Mr. Lagunes said.

But, he added, “Mexico is one of the riskiest countries in the world to do journalism.”

The combination of corruption, weak accountability and weak institutions has left the state vulnerable. In poor and rural areas, it has effectively receded. Criminal groups and youth gangs are filling the void, co-opting local officials or simply muscling them out.

The result may be less dramatic than Mr. Calderón’s drug war, in which warring cartels publicly displayed dismembered corpses. But it is just as deadly, playing out in thousands of home invasions, gang killings and stickups gone wrong.

State and Society Atomize

This is leading communities to do, at the grass-roots level, what Mr. Calderón did a decade earlier: bypass distrusted institutions, worsening the underlying problem.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Businesses and middle-class Mexicans are hiring private security in record numbers. But like the Army, hired guards cannot solve crimes or lock up suspects.

Mark Ungar, a Brooklyn College professor, said this growing practice “relieves a lot of political pressure on the state to improve the police.”

Rural communities, which are more vulnerable, have formed “self-defense” militias to run off gangs and mayors alike.

Inevitably, the militias are even more corruptible and less accountable than the police they replaced. Nearly all target their onetime sponsors for extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Many are involved in the heroin trade, which is booming as opioid addiction drives up American demand.

In a disturbing trend, desperate and frightened communities increasingly seek at least the illusion of security by lynching suspected criminals.

Mr. Ungar said these expressions of vigilantism “represent a disempowerment of the state.”

Paralysis Amid Disaster

Mexicans seem keenly aware that their government is growing less responsive just as streets are becoming more dangerous. Polls show growing dissatisfaction, particularly over corruption.

“We have this political class that totally forgets why they are there,” said Armando Torjes, a community activist in Guadalupe, a working-class city in the northeast.

Each election, he said, brings a new official with a new three-year plan. Most, he added, leave office conspicuously wealthier.

When officials do act, they address superficial issues, adding more patrols or changing police strategy without confronting what he called the country’s “social decomposition.”

Mr. Valdés, the former head of the intelligence service, described facing a similar struggle in top levels of government.

“We wanted to improve the institutions, the judges, the jails, the police,” he said. “We spent years trying to convince the political class.”

But he found those institutions — dominated by parties rather than technocrats and subject to the whims of officials who are required by law to cycle out every term — unresponsive, just as Mr. Torjes had.

“What’s happening in Guadalupe is what’s happening in all of Mexico,” Mr. Torjes said. “There was a political demand for change, but nothing really changed for us.”",Mexico’s Record Violence Is a Crisis 20 Years in the Making,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/americas/mexico-violence.html

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.
“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.
“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said.
So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty?","Along with other frailty measures, that meant that “surgery is not going to go very well,” Dr. Robinson said. In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery. If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now.

Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages. Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65.

But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85. “There’s a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans,” said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof. The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia.

Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age. A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.

In the United States, though, “it’s the surgeons who have picked up the banner,” Dr. Walston said. They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.

You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress.

Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed — all can take a toll.

“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.

Researchers have shown that after major operations — including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants — frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after they’re discharged.

They’re also more likely to die.

But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine.

Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer — “patients and providers often don’t think twice about these,” Dr. Seib said.

Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications).

“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said. Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, “I wouldn’t say it’s routine yet,” she added.

So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty? Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be?

Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about. “There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it,” said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research.

First, many surgical centers offer a “prehabilitation” program, shown to improve patients’ results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation. Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, “it improves your bounce-back capability,” Dr. Fried said.

Physical activity, in particular, “seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression,” Dr. Fried added — even for those not contemplating surgery.

Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing. Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia. A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh.

With frailty, “I’m going to counsel the patient differently,” Dr. Robinson said. “Maybe change the surgery I do. Maybe find an alternative. There’s a spectrum of possibilities.”

Take his patient with gallstone disease.

After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure.

Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient. But “for a physiologically vulnerable older adult,” Dr. Robinson said, “it’s a whole different equation.”",One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/elderly-surgery-frailty.html

MOGADISHU, Somalia — A truck bomb detonated outside a hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, minutes before gunmen on foot stormed the building on Saturday afternoon, killing at least 23 people and wounding at least 30 others, the police reported.

Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone from the scene, Capt. Mohamed Hussein said 30 people, including a government minister, were rescued from the Nasa-Hablod hotel as heavy gunfire continued in the standoff between extremists and security forces. Three of the five attackers were killed, Mr. Hussein said.

The United States under President Trump has made a renewed push to defeat the Shabab, Somali-based militants who have terrorized the country and East Africa for years, killing civilians across borders, worsening famine and destabilizing a broad stretch of the region.

The Shabab — which once controlled most of Mogadishu — have lost much of their territory in recent years, the result of attacks by African Union forces, a fitfully strengthening Somali Army and increasing American air power.

For years they had attended country shows together, giddy when they planned each adventure. On Oct. 1, they were just three California grandmothers joining the rest of crowd in singing “God Bless America.”

Then came the crack of gunfire, and they were three panicked women trapped in a killing field.

Pati died.

A bullet hit Kim in the back.

Only Dana emerged unharmed.

So much of the attention in the aftermath of mass shootings has been focused on the gunman and the number left dead in his wake. But the injured who survive carry a special burden. “We all kind of forget that these people have to live with it for the rest of their lives,” said Dr. Bryan Tsao, chair of the neurology department at Loma Linda University Health.

Dr. Tsao is still treating three patients from the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Battered physically and emotionally, none have been able to return to work, he said.

He described the post-shooting process as one of deconstructing old lives and reconstructing new ones.

“Those that I’ve seen that cannot — that cannot stop dwelling on the tragedy of it, on the injustice of it, on their permanent disability — they don’t do well,” he said. “They take the struggle and kind of go down a different road.”

“He took a part of me that I can’t get back”

Ms. Gervais is being treated at Loma Linda, not far from her house, and just four miles from the scene of the San Bernardino attack.

On Day 19 of her recovery, she was in her hospital room, in the wheelchair, wearing a neck brace and thick compression socks. A humidifier puffed mist above her head. Her daughter Amber Manka, 30, stood by with her own two children.

Ms. Gervais, 56, runs a business servicing trash compactors. She spends — or spent — her weekends riding ATVs in the desert, wearing leather gloves and a full-face helmet. When her husband, a sprint car racer, died after a crash, she raised her two girls on her own.

She had lived a difficult life, she said, which steeled her for challenges. But even for her, this was a lot. “I’m disgusted,” she said of the gunman. “I’m angered, I have all kinds of emotions toward him. Because he took a part of me that I can’t get back.”

She blames her injuries on Mr. Paddock, not the casino or the concert host or gunmakers. “I have nothing against guns. Just him.”

She has no feeling in her legs, and extremely limited use of her arms. Her daughters saw it as a victory when she was able to bend and extend her elbows, something doctors had not expected. She does about three hours of physical therapy a day.

“Why would one person do something like this to people?” she said. “If you’re that unhappy with your life, why hurt others?”

At night, the workers here turn her every few hours, to prevent bedsores. And sometimes she wakes up shaking.

Her daughter, Ms. Manka, has steered the family since the shooting, aided by her husband and younger sister.

She already has anxiety, and when she learned that her mother had been shot, she spent an hour vomiting.

In private, Ms. Manka said she was overwhelmed. “But mostly I just try to keep that away from her,” she said.

At the hospital, a man entered with a clipboard and said he was there to discuss the equipment Ms. Gervais will need when she goes home, which could be weeks or months from now. Among her needs are an expensive wheelchair, a remodeled bathroom, a new car, a nurse, and a way to run her business and pay her mortgage.

“You know,” he said, looking at the women, “your insurance will probably not cover any of this.”

Many families caught in mass attacks have found it difficult to pay for or get the care they need. Insurance companies put up fights. Donations run out.

After the San Bernardino shooting, the county repeatedly denied or delayed coverage to survivors, leaving people without the medicines, therapy and health aides their doctors said they needed.

Ms. Gervais would have to figure out the money later. For now, Ms. Manka used her right arm to spoon butter noodles into her mother’s mouth and her left to hold her daughter on her hip.

“Can I have some milk?” Ms. Gervais said.

Her daughter smiled and held the straw to her mother’s lips.

“I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital”

That night, a friend of Ms. Gervais had arranged a bingo fund-raiser to help pay for some of the costs. Collections from a GoFundMe page the family had started would barely cover the wheelchair.

Two hundred people crowded into an elementary school cafeteria, where a large sign bore the school motto: “No Excuses at Sky Country.”

“O-72!” said the bingo announcer.

At a lunch table in the back sat Dana Smith, the only one of the three women to make it out unscathed. She wore a blue shirt that matched her blue eyes.

Ms. Smith, 52, had known both Kim and Pati for more than 20 years, and was the one who had brought them all together.

In the weeks since the shooting, she had left the house three times, she said. She does not sleep or eat much, and spends time watching videos of that night, as if to remind herself it was real.

Some days she gets out of bed. “Wednesday I didn’t,” she said. “It was like I didn’t care. There was nothing to get me going.”

She has not returned to her job as an aide at a high school, because she is worried that the popping of milk cartons, a student prank, will throw her into a panic.

Melissa Strassner can relate. She was 14 in 1999, when two of her classmates went on a killing spree at Columbine High School. She watched them shoot her friend Anne Marie Hochhalter, and six months after the school shooting, Anne Marie’s mother killed herself.

“I felt like it had been my fault,” Ms. Strassner said. “If I had not run away from her, maybe she would not have been paralyzed, maybe her mother wouldn’t have made the decision she made.”

“You’re never going to be the person you were the day before the shooting,” she added. “You have to mourn the loss of that person.”

Ms. Smith had visited Ms. Gervais a few days before the fund-raiser. That was difficult, she said, because she feels guilty for being able to walk, for being alive. And she feels guilty for feeling guilty, wishing she could bury her own anguish to help her friends.

She is seeing a therapist, but is still haunted by the facts. “Three of us went,” she said. “And I left one in the morgue and one in the hospital.”

“Mr. Stephen Paddock: I forgive you, sir”

The night of the concert, Pati Mestas, 67, had moved to the front row, where she danced while her friends hung back.

This was typical for Ms. Mestas, who was one of the Go Girls, fans of a country radio station who wore wristbands so they could find each other at shows. She died wearing cowgirl boots and a star-spangled T-shirt.

She had spent most of the past 15 years living with her son Jeremy Schmidt, his wife and their four children. She was the one who sneaked the little ones candy, who let them watch what they wanted on television.

After the shooting, Mr. Schmidt raced to Las Vegas, unsure if his mother was alive. His youngest daughter, age 8, kept asking her mother: “Did Dad find Nana?”

When Mr. Schmidt returned, he wrote in a Facebook post what he had told his daughter:

What I won’t do is harbor hate in my heart for the man who did this senseless act of violence.

I will not allow my kids to let hate grow in their hearts for this man.

He was so troubled that he thought ruining other people’s lives was the answer.

Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might.","A retirement crisis already looms. Three out of four Americans worry that they will not have enough money to get through their retirements, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. About 45 percent have not saved a cent toward it.

Mr. Trump, sensitive to the firestorm that could be provoked by limits on 401(k) contributions, tweeted that there would “be NO change” to this “great and popular middle class tax break” — before conceding it might be a part of legislative horse-trading.

Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the principal Republican architect of the tax plan in the House, also scrambled to reassure critics that a rewrite would not undermine retirement savings.

“All the focus is on, can we help people save more,” he said.

Yet for all the alarming rhetoric about crushed nest eggs, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.

First, the debate on Capitol Hill is not really about retirement; it’s about lawmakers’ feverish hunt for revenue to finance tax cuts. Second, no matter what happens, it won’t solve the fundamental problem — that many Americans will outlive their savings.

There are several types of subsidized retirement accounts. People who work at larger companies tend to set aside money in a 401(k); they don’t pay taxes until they withdraw funds. By contrast, Americans who open an account known as a Roth get a different kind of break. They pay tax on money before it is deposited, but then get to withdraw it and the subsequent earnings tax-free in the future.

Details of the Republican tax plan have not yet been released, but the talk has been of imposing a cap of $2,400 a year on tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) plans — a sharp reduction from the current ceiling of $18,000 a year for people under 50, and $24,000 for people age 50 and above.

There would still be a tax benefit, but it would probably be under a Roth-style structure.

To some people, enjoying the break when they withdraw money instead of when they deposit it may not make a difference. But for Republicans in Washington desperately seeking a fast boost in revenue, timing is everything.

Their tax bill includes giant reductions in business taxes. Figuring out how to pay for tax cuts is always a grueling task, but it is especially complicated in today’s bitterly partisan atmosphere. Republican lawmakers intend to push through a bill without any Democratic support — but there is a catch. The single-party strategy in this case triggers a rule that requires the policy to have no impact on the budget at the end of 10 years. To make the math work, lawmakers need to come up with the revenue to pay for the cuts sooner rather than later.

Photo

That’s where 401(k)’s come in. Rather than allow workers to continue delaying their tax payments, the Republican leadership wants to collect tax revenue on most new contributions upfront so they can use it to pay for those expensive corporate tax cuts. That’s the equivalent of a middle-class tax increase.

“It’s just an enormous budget gimmick,” said William Gale of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “It’s raiding future revenues to pay for current tax cuts. This is not a retirement security story.”

The accounting sleight-of-hand irks Mr. Gale, a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush, because, he says, it is financially irresponsible. “It’s just government borrowing by another name,” he said. “You’re not really raising revenue,” just changing when it’s collected.

The question of whether deferring taxes on retirement savings is actually good policy, however, is a separate matter.

Tax-subsidized retirement accounts have long roused fans and critics. Budget cutters point to the trillions of dollars they cost the Treasury Department. Groups concerned about growing inequality complain that the tax break primarily benefits higher-income Americans who would save for retirement anyway. Those with more modest salaries generally have less access to work-based plans or can’t afford to save. Consumer advocates worry they are too vulnerable to the vagaries of the stock market.

Still, these retirement plans are extremely popular among middle and upper-income voters and many of the politicians who represent them — which is why previous attempts to eliminate them have failed.

Whether a tax-deferred 401(k) or a Roth is a better deal is not clear. Younger workers starting out can reasonably assume they are in a lower tax bracket now and benefit from a Roth, while middle-age workers may assume they will be in a lower bracket after they retire. But mostly there are question marks. Who knows if Congress will raise or lower tax rates 30 years from now, or if someone will shift from a higher tax bracket to a lower one? (It wouldn’t be the first time taxes on retirement income changed — Social Security benefits were shielded from federal income taxes for decades before the law changed in 1983.)

Mr. Gale says he thinks the immediacy of the 401(k) tax break encourages people to save more than they otherwise might. So does Mr. Benna, the 401(k)’s inventor. Although he says the tax deferral alone — without employers matching some of their employees’ contributions — was probably insufficient to persuade lower-wage workers to participate, it has nudged up middle-class savings. “It’s harder to save the same amount after taxes,” he said. “There will be a drop-off in contributions.”

But other experts aren’t so sure.

Andrew Biggs, formerly a principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said that for most people, it makes little difference whether they pay taxes on retirement savings now or in the future. Automatic enrollment and the employer matches are much more important than the delayed taxes, said Mr. Biggs, now a retirement specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

Some studies have confirmed his hunch. One team of researchers looked at a handful of companies that offered a tax-deferred savings plan and then added a Roth option to the menu. They found the total amount of contributions didn’t change much. “The tax deduction was a pretty minor force,” said James Choi, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management and a part of that team.

And depending on future tax law, Mr. Choi said that retirees with Roth accounts could get by with smaller contributions than those with 401(k)’s because they won’t have to pay as much tax on the savings they withdraw.

The possibility that people may save less overall is fueling financial services industry opposition to the tax proposal currently in Congress. Plan administrators — which include major mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group — are paid a share of the assets under their control; if the assets shrink, so do their fees.

What worries Mr. Choi, though, is the Republicans’ idea to cap the amount of tax-deferred contributions at $2,400 a year, while treating the rest like Roth contributions.

Setting the cap there could drag down savings because people tend to interpret such thresholds as recommendations, he said. From that perspective, it would be better to eliminate tax deferrals altogether rather than set such a low ceiling.

Yet whether the 401(k) caps are untouched, slashed or abandoned altogether, the prospect remains that millions of Americans will face retirement with no savings.",Limit on 401(k) Savings? It’s About Paying for Tax Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/business/401k-limit-tax-cuts.html

They stay in motel rooms, often far enough from the events to avoid detection, or on campgrounds after trading suggestions on Facebook, Gab and Twitter.

Alt-right supporters headed on Saturday morning to a “White Lives Matter” rally in Shelbyville, in Central Tennessee. Another rally had been planned for the afternoon in nearby Murfreesboro, but was canceled. Organizers chose the region to protest the resettlement of refugees in the area, and to call attention to the shooting last month at a predominantly white church that killed one person and injured several others. The man jailed in the shooting, who is black, left a note that referred to Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

In preparation for the rallies, Occidental Dissent, a website popular among white nationalists, offered recommendations and guidelines on topics including attire (white or black polo shirts and khakis “to make a good impression”) and chants (“Blood and Soil!”), as well as a preview of a private event described as “a time to relax, socialize and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people in our movement after two hours of pro-White activism.”

On Friday, about 20 demonstrators, including Harry Hughes from Arizona, had dinner together at an Olive Garden.

“I come to these events routinely because I think we have a message, and we also look for reaction from the public,” said Mr. Hughes, a member of a neo-Nazi group, adding that he often includes sightseeing on his trips.

Zaine Deal, a Traditional Workers Party member from Ohio who was making a quicker trip to the South, said he and 10 other men had driven to Tennessee on Friday for the weekend’s events and planned to leave on Sunday. They split two hotel rooms.

“We’re guys,” a helmet-wearing Mr. Deal, 18, said at the Shelbyville rally on Saturday. “We’re usually arguing about who gets to sleep on the floor.”

Mr. Deal said he planned to travel for more events to advance the same strains of ideology that apparently led the three men from Texas this month to Florida, where they remained jailed on bonds of at least $1 million each.

The Texas men had growing histories as activists who were willing to travel from their homes in the Houston area to support the alt-right, and all three attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly when, according to the police, a white nationalist from Ohio drove his car into a crowd. One of the men arrested in Florida, William H. Fears, had also surfaced at other events, including at least three in Texas, according to news and social media accounts of the events.

A few hours before the shooting, Mr. Fears, who faces a charge of attempted homicide, spoke to The Gainesville Sun about what he depicted as the movement’s newfound aggression.

“We’re starting to push back, we’re starting to want to intimidate back,” he told the newspaper. “We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we’re not to be taken lightly. We don’t want violence, we don’t want harm, but at the end of the day, we’re not opposed to defending ourselves.”

On Friday, asked about the charges against Mr. Fears and the other men, Mr. Spencer said: “If the allegations are correct, then they really did a bad thing. It’s not defensible, to be honest.”

But Mr. Spencer and his allies have no plans to abandon the events that prompt controversy and turmoil. Brad Griffin, the publisher of Occidental Dissent, estimated that up to 90 percent of people at the alt-right’s public events are regulars who travel from afar, a figure Mr. Spencer agreed with. Mr. Griffin said that the movement struggled to attract more local support because of the promise of public condemnation.

“We’re breaking a taboo,” said Mr. Griffin, who also oversees public relations for the League of the South, which describes itself as a “Southern nationalist” organization, and who helped promote Saturday’s rallies. “We might have supporters in the area, we might have supporters in the state, but the number of people who are willing to take those risks always reduces turnout.”

The movement’s most fervent activists are often met by left-wing opponents, like those in the Antifa movement, who have a similar, if more extensive, history of traveling. They normally benefit, observers said, from long-established networks that support liberal protesters, sometimes offering meals and couches to crash on.

Starting with the street clashes in Seattle during the World Trade Organization conference in 1999, “you just see this roving band that was at everything,” said Scott Crow, a longtime liberal activist and author who lives in Texas. “You’re probably not seeing the same Antifa people at every Richard Spencer rally, but there are people who are probably at many of those things or the big ones.”

Federal officials have long paid close attention to activists all along the political spectrum, sometimes infiltrating groups they consider extreme. Yet traveling demonstrators, no matter their ideological alignment, often pose particular challenges for the local authorities, who may have little experience handling volatile protests and limited knowledge about people who come from afar.

Social media platforms and the internet only add to the challenge, experts said. While technology yields greater opportunities for intelligence gathering, it also allows for greater coordination among some extremists who, until recently, would have probably stayed close to home.

“They were geographically isolated, they would interact with others and, on occasion, they would travel,” said John D. Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. “What’s different today than, say, five years ago is that more and more people seem to be self-connecting with the cause of white supremacy versus joining a white supremacist group.”

And experts said a blend of easy access and coordination, as well as perceptions of a hands-off approach to policing past rallies, sometimes draws outspoken activists who ordinarily would have remained “underground.”

On the web page with instructions and guidelines for the demonstrations in Tennessee, Mr. Griffin included an admonishment that “another Charlottesville” is “not in our interest.” Rather, one of the weekend’s stated objectives was to “foster greater unity and cohesion within our own movement.”

Mr. Griffin, despite his movement’s record of failing to attract many local supporters, said he was hoping Tennesseans would be more open to their beliefs than Charlottesville residents were.

But in Shelbyville, outside the small area designated for the demonstrators, the streets seemed to be dotted only by police officers, journalists and counter-demonstrators. Mr. Deal, the helmeted Traditional Workers Party member, surveyed the crowd and pointed at his political opponents.

You need not be a media historian to notice that we live in a golden age of press harassment, domestic propaganda and coercive efforts to control political debate. The Trump White House repeatedly seeks to discredit the press, threatens to strip broadcasters of their licenses and calls for the firing of journalists and football players for speaking their minds. A foreign government tries to hack our elections, and journalists and public speakers are regularly attacked by vicious, online troll armies whose aim is to silence opponents.

In this age of “new” censorship and blunt manipulation of political speech, where is the First Amendment? Americans like to think of it as the great protector of the press and of public debate. Yet it seems to have become a bit player, confined to a narrow and often irrelevant role. It is time to ask: Is the First Amendment obsolete? If so, what can be done?

These questions arise because the jurisprudence of the First Amendment was written for a different set of problems in a very different world. The First Amendment was ignored for much of American history, coming to life only in the 1920s thanks to the courage of judges like Learned Hand, Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Courts and civil libertarians used the amendment to protect speakers from government prosecution and censorship as it was practiced in the 20th century, such as the arrest of pamphleteers and the seizure of anarchist newspapers by the Postal Service.

But in the 21st century, censorship works differently, as the writer and academic Zeynep Tufekci has illustrated. The complete suppression of dissenting speech isn’t feasible in our “cheap speech” era. Instead, the world’s most sophisticated censors, including Russia and China, have spent a decade pioneering tools and techniques that are better suited to the internet age. Unfortunately, those new censorship tools have become unwelcome imports in the United States, with catastrophic results for our democracy.

The Russian government was among the first to recognize that speech itself could be used as a tool of suppression and control. The agents of its “web brigade,” often called the “troll army,” disseminate pro-government news, generate false stories and coordinate swarm attacks on critics of the government. The Chinese government has perfected “reverse censorship,” whereby disfavored speech is drowned out by “floods” of distraction or pro-government sentiment.

He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.

Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year’s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.

Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens — Centra, Stox and Hubiits — has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.

But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.

“It’s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. “But I’m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.”

Coins of the Digital Wild West

The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.

Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.

Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks — like the next generation of the internet.

But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.

The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company’s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.

The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani’s old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.

“You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!” he wrote in one post.

The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra’s founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.

“Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world’s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,” the announcement said.

Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.

The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra’s website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra — and none of the details on Mr. Edwards’s LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.

Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company’s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted.

The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.

“When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,” Mr. Sharma said in an interview.

Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company’s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.

There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.

After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.

But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.

“Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,” Mr. Gendron said.

Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company’s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.

Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn’t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.

The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.

“He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,” Mr. Fern said. “It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.”

Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was “a kid.”

He said the landlord’s statements were “not accurate.”

Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati

For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.

The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had “a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.”

Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma’s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.

“As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,” the indictment said.

Mr. Sharma said that he couldn’t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.

“I’m obviously not comfortable with that situation,” he said. “But it’s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.”

He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.

Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra’s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.

“He’ll do anything we ask,” Mr. Trapani said. “He’ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.”

The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid.

After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.

Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather’s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. “We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,” Mr. Sharma said. “It was a very direct, individual deal.”

Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.

Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.

In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: “Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!” Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.

Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project — a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.

For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.

Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.

Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything. But they say that won’t happen.

Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.

“I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,” Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. “Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.”

Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma’s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.

Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances, came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies, giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive. Lord & Taylor will rent a quarter of the building, maintaining a smaller version of itself. WeWork will take over the rest for its headquarters and the leasing of shared office space — and tutorials perhaps for what is supposed to count now as a good time.","Lord & Taylor, WeWork and the Death of Leisure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/lord-taylor-wework-and-the-death-of-leisure.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

But it’s hardly universal, partly because there is and always has been disagreement about the very mission of higher education. Should it grapple with the world as it is or point the way to the world as it should be?

Even before Trump’s election, there was welling discussion about the ideological uniformity of many colleges, where the left holds bold and sometimes imperious sway.

In 2013 the University of Colorado, Boulder, welcomed its first “visiting scholar in conservative thought,” a teaching position created to bring someone from the right to the school each year. In 2015 Jonathan Haidt, a justly celebrated social psychologist at New York University, helped to found the Heterodox Academy, an organization that promotes intellectual diversity in higher education.

And a growing number of educators have been wondering aloud if there should be “affirmative action” for conservative professors, given the hugely disproportionate percentage of liberal faculty in the humanities and social sciences. They often conclude that outright preferences are a bad idea but that creating an extra position in, say, military history rather than gender studies would probably up the odds of adding a Republican to the lineup.

Trump’s election at once imperiled and emboldened this movement. To some college administrators and instructors, it was proof that the barbarians were at the gate and that students needed safe spaces more than ever. Understanding what happened on Nov. 8 was less important than fighting furiously against it.

“The idea that the only people who voted for Trump have missing front teeth is really so extraordinary, and yet I think that’s largely what people in the academy think,” said Jean Yarbrough, a conservative professor of political science at Bowdoin College who voted for him herself. These faculty members, she added, consider 2016 “an illegitimate election, so they’re not worried about their being out of touch with America.”

But others are rightly concerned, and that includes parents. Inside Higher Ed published an article recently in which college-placement advisers said that some clients wanted to steer clear of certain elite schools — Yale and Brown were singled out — that struck them as overzealously progressive.

Lynn Morton, the president of Warren Wilson College, publicly expressed dissatisfaction with its reputation as a bohemian enclave and made an explicit appeal for conservative students.

Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that “to create deeper intellectual and political diversity, we need an affirmative-action program for the full range of conservative ideas and traditions, because on too many of our campuses they seldom get the sustained, scholarly attention that they deserve.” He said that in addition to Wesleyan’s commitment to admitting at least 10 military veterans to every freshman class, it would welcome senior military officials as instructors and would tweak its curriculum to offer, for example, a course on the philosophical underpinnings of free enterprise.

For educators open to such changes, the election was both an illustration and a consequence of how polarized our country had become and how poorly Americans in separate cultural and ideological camps communicated with one another. And they aren’t content simply to put “Hillbilly Elegy” on the summer reading list for incoming students (which many colleges have done).

Hence the Inside Higher Ed survey’s discovery of a heightened interest in applicants whose demographic and geographic profiles dovetail with those of Trump voters. If colleges are serious about the educational benefits of diversity, the thinking goes, they need to factor in those students, and they can’t promote respectful, elevated debate if the campus is one big blissful love-in of like-minded liberals. Affluent teenagers from Brooklyn Heights, Brookline and Bethesda need to hear from evangelicals, from young men and women who did tours of duty in Afghanistan, from those whose relatives thrilled to Trump.

Bowdoin’s Yarbrough stressed that college is when you have the energy for “staying up through the night to argue with people in your dorm.” But to do that, those dorm mates must have different opinions and an invitation to express them. Most colleges like hers aren’t creating that atmosphere, she said, adding, “I think it’s a dereliction of duty.”

I see scattered signs that colleges are owning up to that. Johns Hopkins University recently announced an initiative, backed by a $150 million gift, to “address the deterioration of civic engagement” and promote “inclusive discourse.” The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is nurturing a new Institute of Politics with similar goals.

Public schools like U.N.C. have an additional incentive to accommodate a full range of viewpoints. “If colleges are seen as disconnected,” Jaschik noted, “why would Joe Taxpayer in Raleigh care about what happens in Chapel Hill?” Indeed, some state universities have already felt the sting of conservative lawmakers’ disapproval, and a Pew Research Center poll in June showed that a significant majority of Republicans and conservative-leaning independents now believe that colleges have a negative impact on America.

I don’t agree, and I’m not suggesting that colleges normalize Trump, validate everyone who backed him or make room for the viciously bigoted sentiments he often stoked. But there’s inquisitive, constructive territory short of that.

And colleges should be places where we learn to persuade people not to take paths that we consider dangerous instead of simply gaping and yelling at them. That requires putting them and their ideas into the mix. Too many schools are flunking that assignment.",Too Many Colleges Flunk Trump 101,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/colleges-flunk-trump-101.html

(Rebel Billy’s starter stache being a close second.) For all of the tres-’80s trappings, Reese’s Pieces and paranormal pyrotechnics, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer have kept “Stranger Things” grounded in the story of a bunch of relatively normal people who went through an extraordinary and cataclysmic experience.

“Stranger Things” was a kick thanks to its (exhaustively documented) references and Goonie thrills. But it resonated because its tale of monsters and plucky outsiders channeled the heart as well as the aesthetics of its influences.

Market demands aside, it wasn’t clear that the show even needed a second season, and the Duffers’ silly insistence that it be called “Stranger Things 2” — like a real movie sequel! — suggested the sort of showrunner overreach that scuttled the sophomore seasons of other recent summer sensations, like “True Detective” and “UnREAL.”

So it comes as a nice surprise that the second season instead evinces the best of serial television, expanding the story and moving it forward while honoring the characters and the often traumatic paths that brought them here.

Photo

On the expansion side we have the aforementioned Billy (Dacre Montgomery), who brought his bitchin’ Camaro, snug Canadian tuxedo and stink of adolescent danger to town from California. His sister (maybe?) Max (Sadie Sink) is a Dig Dug savant, and the obsession of Lucas and the newly toothed Dustin. (Gaten Matarazzo continues to steal every scene he’s in.) The always great Brett Gelman (“Twin Peaks: The Return,” “Eagleheart”) is on hand as an investigator who’s possibly fleecing Barb’s folks, but who also has legitimate-sounding intel about Eleven.

The season actually began with a broadening of the story, tracking a robber gang fleeing the police through the streets of Pittsburgh. After one of them mentally tricks a cop into crashing his and the other cars in pursuit, a “008” tattoo on her wrist reminds us that, oh right, there are potentially at least 10 other Elevens running around to spark telekinetic mayhem and future subplots.

We’ll return to Eight at some point, presumably, but after the brief introduction we landed back in Hawkins, Ind., a few days before Halloween, 1984, not quite a year after the events of Season 1. The boys are budding video junkies, dumping too many quarters into the then-revolutionary but actually pretty lame animated game Dragon’s Lair.

Soon the Upside Down beckons, and Will beholds a fiery storm in the gloom.

Paul Reiser, riffing on his duplicitous “Aliens” character, has replaced Matthew Modine as the master of Upside Down ceremonies. He explains that although Will thinks, 1.) he’s dimension-hopping; and 2.) that a malevolent force is saying it wants to kill everyone, what he’s really experiencing is post-traumatic stress.

“I need you to realize I’m on your side,” he tells a skeptical Joyce. (Note: He is probably not on her side.)

With its tendril-like limbs and leafy face flaps, the Demogorgon had a botanical quality: Last year, I called it a monster mash-up of Alien, Predator and a Venus flytrap, and I stand by the description. This time around the menace seems even more explicitly vegetal. Work in the lab involves a lot of pruning via flamethrower while, on the outskirts of town, the pumpkin patches have begun to resemble Civil War battlefields. You don’t have to be Sheriff Hopper to see a connection.

What you do have to be him to see, at least for now, is Eleven. You’ll recall that at the end of last season, he was leaving out Eggos for her — apparently at some point he made contact and was able to take her in.

The arrangement offers a poignant second chance for Hopper, who lost his own daughter to illness, even as Mike and perhaps Eleven suffer from the separation. We’ll see how long it lasts. “Stranger Things 2” (sigh) deserves credit for not immediately defaulting to “Eleven and the Nerds Ride Again,” but you can bet it will get there before long.

A Few Thoughts While We Crank It Up

• The premiere did a decent job of mixing in less played-out ’80s hits, like Oingo Boingo’s “Just Another Day,” with the more obvious ones (“Whip It,” “Talking in Your Sleep”). But sometimes the most obvious option is the best one: “Rock You Like a Hurricane” is the only choice for a denim-clad cheese ball like Billy.

• Nancy switched up her hairstyle, but the thing she really needs to change is sitting next to her, bungling his college admissions essay. That would be Steve, who’s already envisioning working for his dad and settling down. Run, Nancy! It’s too late for Barb — save yourself!

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But in the Gourma, risks to the brigade are constant, and missions have turned deadly. In August, the brigade’s radio operator was killed when part of the team responded to protect a United Nations camp in Douentza, Mali, from a raid by armed men that also claimed the life of a peacekeeper, according to officials.

In September, an ambush by unknown assailants who used a roadside bomb and gunfire to attack the brigade’s convoy injured three.

On a routine operation last month, a reporter joined the brigade as it drove to a remote village to follow up on a tip that two elephants had been killed.

The convoy bounced over a road riddled with potholes, past remains of burned-out trucks, through a sandstorm and rain, and then into fields of sucking mud and soft dunes.

After arriving in the village, representatives from the brigade met with local leaders to share information about elephants, while the brigade’s men socialized with the villagers and bought chickens for later meals.

No one had heard anything about any elephant deaths, and the tip was dismissed.

While the brigade has successfully prevented poaching since February, officials worry ivory traffickers are merely waiting for an opportunity to resume operations. Putting a permanent dent in poaching will take arrests and convictions that break apart ivory trafficking networks for good, experts said.

“The whole law enforcement pathway, from intelligence in the beginning to conviction in the end, needs to be looked at,” said Chris Thouless, a strategic adviser at Save the Elephants.

It will not be easy. The ivory trafficking networks are vast and complex, extending far beyond Mali’s borders.

Since 1989, 81 ivory seizures in 15 countries were either linked to Mali as an exporting country or to Malian nationals who were arrested in connection to the crimes, said Tom Milliken, the elephant and rhinoceros program leader for Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring network.","Mali’s Desert Elephants, on Edge of Annihilation, Get a Fighting Chance",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/world/africa/mali-elephants-gourma.html

And sushi, which is about as endemic to Burmese cuisine as Texas chili, has become their livelihood.

“Sometimes one immigrant breaks through in a big way and creates opportunity for a lot of other people,” said David Dyssegaard Kallick, who studies immigrant entrepreneurship at the Fiscal Policy Institute in New York.

For the Burmese in the sushi business, Philip Maung may have been the one who broke through.

He arrived in the United States in 1989 as a 22-year-old with big ambitions but no money. After the early ’90s recession crippled his dreams of making it big in real estate, Mr. Maung joined Advanced Fresh Concepts, a Southern California company started by a Japanese immigrant who pioneered the supermarket-sushi concept. The formula: The store provides a display case, refrigerator and storage. The company supplies the ingredients and chefs to prepare the rolls on-site.

After a few years running Advanced Fresh stations, Mr. Maung struck out on his own, betting on untapped markets. In 1998, he started Hissho Sushi in Charlotte, N.C., a financial center where he figured he would get a loan.

But Hissho, which means “certain victory” in Japanese, was no easy win.

Banks shunned him. He borrowed $100,000 from friends and family, and maxed out his credit cards. To save money, he slept in his car when he traveled from retailer to retailer pitching the idea of fresh sushi inside their supermarkets, next to deli salads or cupcakes.

It was a tough sell. “Sushi? Give me a break,” he recalled being told. “Americans like pizza and fried chicken.”

But he gradually won over some independent grocers, and by 2001 had sushi bars in 15 stores in Midwestern and Southern states ringing up $2.5 million in sales.

Hissho grew as the number of Burmese settling in the United States jumped more than tenfold, to about 1,300 in 2004 from just 113 two years earlier. They had fled bloody clashes that for decades pitted the national armed forces against ethnic groups in rural areas fighting for self-determination. In 2007, arrivals rocketed to 14,225 as refugees parked in Malaysia and Thailand were approved for resettlement in the United States.

Hissho swept up many of the newcomers as it expanded. It turned the counters over to the workers once they gained expertise, with the company and the supermarket receiving a cut of the sales.

“It was all by word of mouth,” Mr. Maung said of how he attracted workers from Myanmar.

Today, Hissho has counters in more than 1,100 locations in 41 states, including in national chains like Kroger, university food halls and medical plazas. Mr. Maung projects sales will surpass $140 million this year.

About 95 percent of Mr. Maung’s franchisees, like Mr. Aung in Southern California, are Burmese. They must commit $10,000 in start-up capital and complete a two-week course at the Hissho headquarters before taking over a sushi counter.

On a recent Tuesday in a Hissho classroom, Thant Zin Oo, an instructor, led a discussion in English peppered with Burmese about “how to reconcile the chef’s mind and the business mind.”

Among the 10 pupils planning to run franchises in Colorado, Maryland, Texas and other states, several, like Mr. Aung, had never encountered sushi, let alone Western-style rolls with names like Sriracha Party and Blazing California, before reaching the United States.

“Most of the students are very nervous when they hold sushi rice in their hands” for the first time, said Zhao Zhao Dongmen, another instructor. They press it too hard, and it gets mashed. She advises them to handle the grains “gently, like you are planting grass on the nori,” the dried seaweed sheets that hold the rolls together. Novices are also prone to splurge on fillings, prompting Ms. Dongmen to remind them, “We are making sushi here, not pizza or burrito.”

After leaving Myanmar, Mr. Aung eked out a living for five years peddling garments in Malaysia. He arrived in Kent, Wash., in February 2014, and within a week he was learning the sushi business from his cousin, Nang Moe, a Hissho franchisee, working his bamboo rolling mat until the motions were muscle memory.

A year later, the company invited Mr. Aung to work at its sushi counter in a Sprouts grocery store in Carlsbad, Calif., north of San Diego. He made $11 an hour. Then Hissho offered him a franchise inside the Sprouts in Oceanside, where sales quickly jumped 50 percent, said Pyie Thu, Hissho’s regional manager. Last year, Mr. Thu offered him two more Sprouts stores, the one in Carlsbad where Mr. Aung had worked and another in nearby San Marcos.

He lured fellow Burmese to California, training them to slice salmon and tuna at just the right angle and make perfectly round rolls stuffed with avocado, cucumber and other ingredients. Every one of Mr. Aung’s Burmese protégés has become a franchisee.

Many customers assume that the sushi they are buying is prepared by Japanese chefs, Mr. Aung said, adding that he always tells them the truth if they ask. High quality for value matters much more to them, he said.

From his three counters, Mr. Aung nets $17,000 a month.

A few months ago, his high school sweetheart arrived in the United States — and she promptly began working at his Carlsbad counter. They plan to marry soon and start a family.

His only challenge is that “all the time I am training new people,” he said. “Because when Burmese know sushi, they want their own store.”",Ever Heard of Burmese Sushi Counters? You’ve Probably Been to One,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/burmese-refugees-sushi.html

Ms. Sharpton, who studied at Temple in Philadelphia before completing her education at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York, is now the national director of membership at her father’s National Action Network, which serves more than 100 chapters across the United States. She is also a musical theater actress and has appeared in several local stage productions in the past few years, “hoping to make it as an actress on my own,” she said, “without the help of my dad.”

(Ms. Sharpton has reeled in a different kind of audience in recent years, however, as she has been embroiled in a lawsuit against the City of New York. She said she sprained an ankle when falling on an unpaved street in Lower Manhattan in October 2014. The lawsuit is scheduled to return to the courts next month.)

“She’s fully grown now and independent, she’s self-directed and capable,” Mr. Sharpton said. “And she’s taking on a partner in Marcus who is simply a brilliant young man.”

Their worlds collided on June 1, 2012, outside Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem. Dr. Bright was visiting New York and arrived late to the restaurant, where he was to meet a group of friends, several of whom knew Ms. Sharpton.

By the time he arrived, however, the group was leaving, and a mutual friend introduced him to Ms. Sharpton as she was hailing a taxicab to go home.

“She was absolutely beautiful,” Dr. Bright said.

“He was striking, I was physically attracted to him from the moment I met him,” she said. “I was completely intrigued.”

When Dr. Bright asked Ms. Sharpton why she was in such a hurry, she explained that she needed to be at a rally the next morning, in the company of her father, at the National Action Network’s House of Justice in Harlem, where she produces a two-hour program that airs on radio each Saturday morning on the New York radio station WLIB-AM (1190) and on Impact Television.

Dr. Bright, who was pursuing his Ph.D at the time, told her he had to take an early flight back to Miami the next morning, and they parted ways without exchanging contact information.

The next morning, Ms. Sharpton looked up from her work station during the rally and saw him standing there.

“He stuck out like a sore thumb, this gorgeous, strapping guy in a beautiful suit,” she sad. “I was thrilled to see him.”

Dr. Bright explained his unexpected arrival.

“I have a real interest in civil rights and social justice,” he said. “But I was really interested in Dominique as well.”

As it turned out, Ms. Sharpton was extremely busy at the rally, so she walked over to him and “without speaking a word, flipped him my business card,” she said.

He called her later that day from an airport, and a long-distance relationship soon took flight.

Within two months, they were dating steadily.

“Dominique brings a level of substance, compassion and friendship to my life that I had not known in previous relationships,” he said. “We have a lot of common interests and she understands me, which is why I knew we were going to be together for the long term.”

Asked what was the best wedding gift he could give to his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. Sharpton pointed to his own legacy.

“I think what I’ve taught both of my daughters, and now Marcus, who I consider a son, is that you can start life in one place and end up in a better place if you work hard enough and believe in yourself.”

“I didn’t have a father,” he said. “I grew up on welfare, and yet I’ve been able to do things I never thought I could do. I have my own radio and television show.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country.

The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

We ate our last meal there before heading out of the city toward the vast tea estates and spice gardens that lace the Cardamom Hills of Kerala.

To get there, we spent nearly five hours in a van grinding our way up the steep hills of the Western Ghats, stopping only for plates of vegetable curry and glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The road narrowed as we worked our way past wildlife sanctuaries and forests of sandalwood. The oppressive mugginess of the city had lifted, giving way to weather cool enough that I considered digging out the one light sweater I brought.

Manoj Vasudevan, a photographer who teaches tourism in Kerala and who has been exploring the mountains here for decades, was our guide. That included explaining the finer points of mountain driving in India, which required faith, acceptance and a good horn.

The strips of pavement hugging the mountainside were often only wide enough to hold one vehicle, but sometimes three would try to navigate a stretch at once. Horns were essential to blast our gentle warnings on blind curves. Inevitable traffic knots that brought traffic to a stop were solved when a driver or a passenger would hop out and calmly direct cars and buses to back up or edge around each other. Everyone would then head on without a harsh word or even a friendly wave.

Soon, we were back on the road headed for the heart of spice country. Small spice gardens started to pop up the way “u-pick” apple orchards do in upstate New York. Some offer tours for a couple of hundred rupees, about $3. Others declare themselves to be organic, and have small shops where packets of vibrant ground turmeric, nutmeg and green cardamom pods can be had for prices that would make a cook used to prices at an American grocery store fall to her knees.

Touring spice gardens is a fairly new pursuit here, driven by an increasing appreciation of agriculture and cooking among tourists.

“Twenty years ago when I traveled this way there was not even a single place,” Mr. Vasudevan said. “Ten years ago there were maybe a few places. Now, they’re all over. Somebody started it then everyone started copying it because they saw that people were becoming curious to see how spices grow.”

And then there’s black pepper. From the time of the Roman Empire, people have been coming to Kerala for black pepper. Wars have been fought over it. The plants that produce the fruit are everywhere. Their thin green vines wrap around jackfruit, mango and coconut trees that grow with such abandon they don’t seem to need a bit of human effort to thrive.

Cardomom is a big money maker here, but black pepper remains the coin of the realm. Even though Indian pepper growers are fighting off cheaper production in countries like Vietnam, there are still plenty of wealthy owners who oversee vast plots of pepper plants. But in every village and small town, you can find someone who grows a little pepper and sells a few kilos when a bill comes due or there’s a wedding to fund. About 30 percent of the people who live here are involved in the spice trade, Mr. Vasudevan estimated.

Ms. Gomez and I found our way to a small, organic spice garden in Thekkady where Thomas Puttampurakkal, a retired Kerala police officer in his 80s, tends to pepper vines that twist around jackfruit and nutmeg trees growing in what seems to be an agricultural system with no real pattern or structure.

He uses only elephant dung for fertilizer. Pepper, he explained, is all about terroir. The best grows naturally here in the high elevations, the green berries protected by the shade until they ripen.

The green pepper berries become black pepper after they spend four or five days in the sun. Those same green berries can also produce white pepper, whose pungency is softened by a long soak in water before they are dried and their husks removed.

Ms. Gomez and I wandered through Mr. Puttampurakkal’s spice garden like kids in a toy store. We rubbed curry leaves between our fingers and dug up turmeric roots. We searched around the bottom of willowy cardamom stalks 12 feet tall, looking for green buds. We sucked the custardy pulp off the seeds inside cacao pods, smelled clove buds and peeled a bit of bark from a cinnamon tree.

We found a nutmeg tree and pulled down a round piece of fruit the size of my palm. Someone had a knife, so we sliced it open to reveal a glossy dark gem covered in a lacy red coat. The seed is nutmeg, the red covering mace.

In the little shop Mr. Puttampurakkal runs, I bought bags of the small, local black Malabar peppercorns locals call tribal pepper and another of the fat, fragrant peppercorns called Tellicherry, named after the famed growing region in Northern Kerala.

I bit into one. It tasted like citrus and flowers. In a split-second, heat overtook the flavor, like hot perfume in my mouth.

Ms. Gomez wandered in, her hands filled with nutmeg. “You have no idea how excited I am,” she said.

Mr. Puttampurakkal was laughing, probably at us. It was hard to tell. It didn’t matter.

I had made it to the Cardamom hills. Ms. Gomez was right. It was God’s own country. Or, at least, a cook’s.

If You Go

Kerala is always warm, but can get downright hot and muggy from March to May. December through February is reliably dry and cooler, and also more crowded. The monsoon season comes in May and can last until November. The mountains with their spice gardens and teas estates are always cooler than the coast. It’s relatively easy to rent a car or van with a driver, or take a small tour bus to the spice and tea regions. Car rentals are available, too.

Tea fans can visit the Briar Tea Bungalows (V-363, Kannan Devan Hills Village, Talliar post, Idukki; teabungalows.com/talayar-valley-bungalow-munnar/) in the Talayar Valley in Munnar, where you can pick your own tea onthe 2,500-acre estate.

Just to understand the history of the stone building that served as the mother and baby home required that I learn more about the development of mid-19th century workhouses, the local impact of the famine known as the Great Hunger, and the Irish war for independence (as well as the civil strife that followed).

But as Conall Ó Fátharta, an investigative reporter for The Irish Examiner, repeatedly told me, the case’s implications extended well beyond the eternal whereabouts of hundreds of children who died at the Tuam home. There had been other mother and baby homes around the country, all connected to what many historians say was part of a system that subjugated vulnerable women — a system that also included the notorious institutions known as the Magdalen Laundries.

And what of the children they were often forced to abandon? There were many more deaths, shadowy adoptions, medical experiments and painful marginalization. To this day, many adult “home babies” are trying to learn what happened to their mothers.

I was paralyzed: The story seemed too complex to be contained in even in an uncommonly long newspaper article. In total, I would interview about three dozen people, but still I needed someone to lead me — and the reader — through this maze of distant and modern Ireland.

Of course, she was right in front of me: Ms. Corless, that woman with no credentials, a gardener and grandmother whose determination had unearthed a troubling part of the past and forced a national reckoning.

I spent several days with the shy Ms. Corless, who patiently recounted her reporting. Tracking down archival documents and maps. Conducting dozens of interviews. Refusing to accept pat answers from those in power. Ms. Corless told me that she was motivated by the thought of all those children who deserved to be remembered. Ireland, she said, owed them at least that.

As I sat in her kitchen one day, sipping tea and eating a slice of apple tart, Ms. Corless answered a number of telephone calls from adult “home babies” now trying to track down relatives. She shared the information she had, promised to do more digging, and was, without fail, patient, even comforting.

Supporters seemed to heed his call on Thursday, when Kenyans went back to the polls. Local reporters across the country said it was difficult to find the long lines that had been a feature of the August poll.

Exact figures were still murky on Saturday, and official statistics were quickly politicized. Wafula Chebukati, the chairman of the elections commission, warned that he couldn’t guarantee a credible vote because of political interference. One of his commissioners, Roselyn Akombe, fled the country and resigned, citing threats against her, including from her fellow commissioners.

On election night, the commission announced a voter participation rate of 48 percent, even as official results were still coming in. The number raised eyebrows, especially in places where participation rates appeared to be in much lower.

The picture became even less clear on Friday morning, when Mr. Chebukati said the number of result sheets the commission had received from polling centers outstripped the number of polls that were open, by 1,205.

Andrew Limo, a spokesman for the elections commission, said the discrepancy was caused by a cellphone network problem and had no bearing on the process.

By Saturday afternoon, Mr. Kenyatta had officially received 3.7 million votes, or more than 98 percent of those the commission says were cast. Commission figures put participation at 46 percent.

Civil society groups painted a different picture. The coalition Kura Yangu, Sauti Yangu (“My Vote, My Voice”), which had deployed 2,000 polling observers across the country, estimated turnout at 38 percent based on a random sample of result forms it had collected. The group saw the highest turnout in Rift Valley, a Kenyatta stronghold where over 60 percent of voters turned out in some places, according to Maina Kiai, a human rights lawyer and one of the coalition leaders.

Confusion around the numbers has fed rumors among opposition supporters. Crowds of men in Kawangware on Saturday said the discrepancies made it impossible to trust the process or accept the outcome.

Anger and fear were palpable there, and crowds shouted “Uhuru must go!” at police vans. At one junction, where motorcycle taxi drivers sat idle and shops were shut, people insisted that the only acceptable outcome was an Odinga presidency.

Others seemed more fatigued than partisan. They said they did not support Mr. Kenyatta, but these past weeks had left them jaded.

“Politicians are like ghosts. Today they say one thing, tomorrow it’s something else. We don’t care what the outcome of all this is. We just want to see change,” said one man, Morris, who said he did not want to be identified by last name for fear of reprisal.

Some men here said language was being used as a proxy for political allegiance — Mr. Kenyatta has strong support among the Kikuyu ethnic community, and Mr. Odinga has the backing of Luos and other, smaller groups. Each ethnic group speaks its own language, making it easy to differentiate.

Security appeared to be the top concern for many. Most of the men on the streets on Saturday worried about a repeat of the violence from the previous night. This time, many said, they would not be caught off guard.

“We can have stones, we can have sticks, we can have pangas,” said another man, Lancaster, using the Swahili word for machete.

Douglas Laycock, a religious liberties scholar and professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, praised the decision.

The cross “asserts the truth of one religion and, implicitly but necessarily, the falsehood of all other religions,” he said. “Its secondary meanings, as in honoring war dead, are entirely derivative of its primary meaning as a symbol of the Resurrection.”

If the Fourth Circuit denies a request for the full court to reconsider the panel’s decision, defenders of the monument vow to take the case to the Supreme Court. They argue that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent, threatening national treasures such as the 24-foot Canadian Cross of Sacrifice and 13-foot Argonne Cross in Arlington National Cemetery — both within the Fourth Circuit’s jurisdiction — as well as the ground zero “cross,” the steel beams discovered among World Trade Center debris now on display in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

“It is brooding hostility toward religion, a sort of cleansing,” said Kelly Shackelford, the president of First Liberty Institute, one of the legal groups aiding the American Legion in defending the cross. “We would immediately need to begin massive bulldozing and sandblasting of veterans memorials across the country in a way that most people would find inconceivable.”

In his Fourth Circuit dissent, Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory, first appointed by President Bill Clinton, argued that the Establishment Clause “does not require the government ‘to purge from the public sphere’ any reference to religion.”

Supporters of the cross also argue that context is vital: The Peace Cross is displayed alongside an American flag, amid a park of memorials for veterans of various wars. Its four sides, they say, are marked prominently with patriotic, not religious, virtues: valor, endurance, courage and devotion. The fallen soldiers are listed on a tablet with a quote from President Woodrow Wilson.

But opponents say it is hardly integrated: No other monument in the area is taller than 10 feet, and there are no other religious symbols in the park. They note that its fallen soldiers’ names are rusted away and obscured by bushes. And the cross has been the site of prayer gatherings as well as Veterans Day vigils — and even such vigils are often opened in prayer.

Two past Supreme Court cases, decided the same day in 2005, may foreshadow the factors that would control the outcome in the Supreme Court.

In McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, officials had authorized the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses. After pushback, they had modified the exhibits to include Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and other historical documents, arguing that the Ten Commandments were similarly influential in the development of Western legal thought.

The Supreme Court ruled the displays unconstitutional, finding that they had no evident secular purpose. Michael W. McConnell, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford, calls such displays “triumphalism — a flavor of who is top dog.”

In a second case, Thomas Van Orden v. Rick Perry, the court allowed carvings of the Ten Commandments in a Texas State Capitol monument that had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a primarily secular group, in 1961. The court cited the donor’s lack of religious intent.

In his Van Orden opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who cast the swing vote in both cases, called the historical factor alone “determinative”: The monument had stood since 1961 without controversy.

The Peace Cross, also donated by a secular group, is almost twice as old as the monument in that case, and has been on public property for a comparable span. If the Supreme Court reviews this one, Mr. McConnell believes it will be squarely governed by Justice Breyer’s opinion.

“I think they thought they were putting this kind of case to rest with Van Orden,” said Mr. McConnell, who has also served as a judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. “Somehow, the Fourth Circuit didn’t get the memo.”

“I think this is a pretty easy case, and I found the Fourth Circuit’s decision quite surprising. If the Supreme Court were to grant review, the likelihood is very high that it would be reversed.”

But Peace Cross opponents argue that there is a stark difference between the Ten Commandments and a cross — namely, the figures each represents.

“The court pointed out that Moses was a lawmaker as well as a religious leader,” said Monica Miller, senior counsel at the American Humanist Association, who argued the case in the Fourth Circuit. “There were connections to the nation’s history of lawmakers that made the Ten Commandments overall less religious than an enormous, free-standing Latin cross that unequivocally represents Christianity.”

The Supreme Court’s thinking on displays of the cross is murky.

In Salazar v. Buono, a 2010 decision regarding a cross-shaped war memorial in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, six justices wrote distinct opinions. In 2011, when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal regarding a series of highway memorial crosses for fallen police officers in Utah, Justice Clarence Thomas’s 19-page dissent argued that the court had rejected “an opportunity to provide clarity to an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles.”

Awaiting its fate, the Peace Cross stands with a tarp draped neatly across the top, where the concrete has begun to crumble. Elizave Mordan, the King Pawn manager, can see it from her shop.

“We heard they may be taking it down, and I disagree with that. It just doesn’t bother anybody around here,” she said as she sorted through used power tools, record players and antique jewelry for sale.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

The difference between being in ninth grade, or a senior in college, or even a catering grunt on the cusp of 30, and now, when I am an actual, indisputable grown-up, is that I can put together a real straight-up, sit-down dinner party in two hours rather than two months. I still cut branches and collect interesting grasses on a morning walk. And my decades of spending school and rent money on yard-sale cotton cocktail napkins, silver nut picks, pearl-tipped hors d’oeuvres forks and ivory-handled cake servers means I can set a beautiful and interesting table in 10 minutes.

And I am now dead sure that the food of a dinner party wants to be made entirely in the home by that home’s cook, with all of that home’s idiosyncrasies writ large. If there is even a whiff of professional chef on the plate, your dinner party is off to a lousy start and won’t recuperate. Someone will invariably be compelled to take a photograph on her smartphone even before the salad course has been cleared, and then, as far as I’m concerned, we will have gathered for some fetishistic, unsavory purpose not meant for the home.

Table Talk Small talk need not be soporific. Before the dinner party, try to find some recent news items or weird science stories that people most likely haven’t heard about. Did you know that music is beneficial to cats undergoing surgery? Or that there is a library in Norway that is amassing 100 never-before-read books that no one can check out for 100 years?

The Martinez cocktail on this night is batched, not because I want to be slick but because I have a whisper-thin, gorgeous glass pitcher that I found for $11 at a Value Village when I was a grad student and that I am thrilled to have the opportunity to use. And while it may come off as an out-of-reach cheffy move to call for feuille de brick for the borek — and to offer no easy-to-source substitute — that is wholly a reflection of the Type A, rather rigid facet of my personality, not of my profession. I am just not ever going to be the kind of girl who says, “Go ahead, if you can’t find pigeon, make the pigeon pie with boneless chicken breasts.” Go find the brick; it’s an uncommon delight, shatteringly crisp and unusual, and most important, it’s the correct ingredient for the recipe.

But just because the cocktail is ready to pour over ice upon guests’ arrival, and the fried borek with halloumi and parsley and grape leaves is even better if fried a few minutes in advance of the party’s start, I’m still, always and forever, going to be about 10 minutes late. I’ve come to believe this is a necessary part of the successful dinner party — these decades later my good friends know this, too. They know to shepherd the uninitiated guests. Pile the newbies’ coats in the bedroom, take their flowers and get them right into water while I am still toweling off and combing my hair. And then we will roll out from there, take our seats around the table, open the wines and pour. The braised leeks and the lentils and the roasted rabbits will be resting on the sideboard. People will pass their plates to be served. At some point, you will tell your one good joke, which you got from your father. And the dessert — walnuts and tangerines and bars of bitter chocolate — will be set out when the candles have shrunk. By now, almost everyone at the table will know that there are more candles in the drawer, and that there is more brandy to be poured, and that we will be sitting around that table for many more hours, twisting the foils in our fingers as we linger.

Those were some of the best days.”

Ashley Sharpton, the bride’s younger sister who served as maid of honor — she and the rest of the wedding party waited patiently as the ceremony began an hour later than scheduled — said that much better days await her big sister.

“Dominique and Marcus are very lucky to have found each other,” she said after the ceremony, as she straightened the train of the bride’s gown, designed by Paulette Cleghorn for Yumi Katsura Couture. “I’ve never seen my sister this happy, and that’s because she has a great guy who fits in perfectly with our family.”

Dr. Bright, an administrator at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn and a frequent contributor to HuffPost, is also the executive director of education for A Better America. He received a bachelor’s degree in government and world affairs from the University of Tampa, a master’s in public administration from Florida International University and a Ph.D. in public administration from Florida Atlantic University.

Dr. Bright’s father, James, said that while his family was not high profile, like the Sharptons, he and his wife raised their children “well, as they did theirs.” He described Dominique as “a wonderful girl and like a daughter to us.”

“Like any other family,” he added, “we hope that our newly married children can make it through the difficult hurdles that exist in every relationship and get to enjoy each other’s company for the rest of their lives.”

Ms. Sharpton, who studied at Temple in Philadelphia before completing her education at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York, is now the national director of membership at her father’s National Action Network, which serves more than 100 chapters across the United States. She is also a musical theater actress and has appeared in several local stage productions in the past few years, “hoping to make it as an actress on my own,” she said, “without the help of my dad.”

(Ms. Sharpton has reeled in a different kind of audience in recent years, however, as she has been embroiled in a lawsuit against the City of New York. She said she sprained an ankle when falling on an unpaved street in Lower Manhattan in October 2014. The lawsuit is scheduled to return to the courts next month.)

“She’s fully grown now and independent, she’s self-directed and capable,” Mr. Sharpton said. “And she’s taking on a partner in Marcus who is simply a brilliant young man.”

Their worlds collided on June 1, 2012, outside Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem. Dr. Bright was visiting New York and arrived late to the restaurant, where he was to meet a group of friends, several of whom knew Ms. Sharpton.

By the time he arrived, however, the group was leaving, and a mutual friend introduced him to Ms. Sharpton as she was hailing a taxicab to go home.

“She was absolutely beautiful,” Dr. Bright said.

They spoke briefly, but long enough for Ms. Sharpton to “want to get to know him better,” as she put it.

“He was striking, I was physically attracted to him from the moment I met him,” she said. “I was completely intrigued.”

When Dr. Bright asked Ms. Sharpton why she was in such a hurry, she explained that she needed to be at a rally the next morning, in the company of her father, at the National Action Network’s House of Justice in Harlem, where she produces a two-hour program that airs on radio each Saturday morning on the New York radio station WLIB-AM (1190) and on Impact Television.

Dr. Bright, who was pursuing his Ph.D at the time, told her he had to take an early flight back to Miami the next morning, and they parted ways without exchanging contact information.

The next morning, Ms. Sharpton looked up from her work station during the rally and saw him standing there.

“He stuck out like a sore thumb, this gorgeous, strapping guy in a beautiful suit,” she sad. “I was thrilled to see him.”

Dr. Bright explained his unexpected arrival.

“I have a real interest in civil rights and social justice,” he said. “But I was really interested in Dominique as well.”

As it turned out, Ms. Sharpton was extremely busy at the rally, so she walked over to him and “without speaking a word, flipped him my business card,” she said.

He called her later that day from an airport, and a long-distance relationship soon took flight.

Within two months, they were dating steadily.

“Dominique brings a level of substance, compassion and friendship to my life that I had not known in previous relationships,” he said. “We have a lot of common interests and she understands me, which is why I knew we were going to be together for the long term.”

“I said to him, ‘Do you want to be a part of this?’ Mr. Sharpton recalled. “I told him if he’s going to to be a storm trooper, he has to be ready for any kind of storm.”

Asked what was the best wedding gift he could give to his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. Sharpton pointed to his own legacy.

“I think what I’ve taught both of my daughters, and now Marcus, who I consider a son, is that you can start life in one place and end up in a better place if you work hard enough and believe in yourself.”

“I didn’t have a father,” he said. “I grew up on welfare, and yet I’ve been able to do things I never thought I could do. I have my own radio and television show. I ran for New York City mayor and president of the United States, and I remember addressing the Democratic convention and seeing Dominique sitting up in those box seats — she knew right then and there that anyone can become anything they want to become in this life.”","A Sunday March, This One Down the Aisle",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/fashion/weddings/al-sharpton-daughter-dominique-marries-marcus-bright.html

The popularity of their food at the market prompted the two chefs to start searching for a more permanent home for their business. Federal lucked out.

The cafe’s wooden-slatted building is surrounded by weathered seating, as well as raised garden beds with wild overgrown herbs, tomatoes, and tiny pansies that decorate the desserts sold inside. Chickens wander among the tables with entitled beady stares, begging for scraps. Inside, up some ramshackle steps, a line of customers forms early at lunchtime to order at the counter and take a number. If they get there after noon they’ll spend some time outside hovering until one of the tables or benches is vacated. (A park across the street provides some needed extra seating.)

Sushi is available at lunch as prepackaged rolls to go, daily specials listed on a blackboard and freshly made hand rolls. The most economical tactic is to order one or two of the rolls from the short menu beside the cash register, but you’ll miss out on the gorgeous salads that accompany the special roll of the day.

The salads here might be punctuated with pink peppercorns, or pepitas, or thin threads that resemble saffron but are actually dehydrated red peppers of varying degrees of spiciness. Tasmanian sea trout sashimi comes fanned out in sweet, pinkish-orange buttery slivers under a mound of greens, herbs and flowers. The impossibly tender beef filet is nestled among one of these kaleidoscopic salads, the meat kissed with yuzu and fresh coriander, as is the eggplant dengaku, which is cooked to a puddinglike fudge along with sweet white miso and served over organic quinoa. If this sounds a little like the gluten-free grain bowls in high demand down the hill in Byron, that’s exactly what it is, upgraded considerably by a dose of deft Japanese technique and flavor.

The short list of burgers here has influences beyond Japan, with extras like Greek halloumi cheese or a sauce made from Spanish-smoked paprika. The patties are shot through with fennel and coriander, and that halloumi burger also sports korokke, a crispy potato patty described on the menu as a Japanese hash brown.

Customers are mainly locals — the restaurant has no website; no one else would know to make the drive up here — but that “local” designation has wide meaning. This part of the world still has a true rural Australian soul, but it now has some of the highest property values in the country, thanks mainly to its proximity to Byron Bay (a former hippie mecca that has morphed into a playground for the moneyed boho set). The customers sitting on the worn wooden benches in Doma’s yard range from newcomers wearing designer linen caftans — colored to match their designer dogs — to tradespeople in dusty boots on their lunch break. If there’s a tension between the two types of locals, it feels easy here among the chickens and flowers.

At breakfast, there are egg and bacon sandwiches, very good espresso drinks and breakfast sushi hand rolls. If you’ve ever wondered what a Japanese hash brown tastes like when rolled up in nori, here’s your chance. (Answer: silly, salty, a little unnecessary, but fun above all else.) The Doma Brekkie is a huge plate of creamy scrambled eggs, a pile of bacon, alarmingly red tomato slices, avocado, sweet onion relish, and sourdough or Japanese brown rice.

In so many ways, Doma is an exemplar of the great Australian cafe — international in its scope, wonderfully casual, but blessed with quality and creativity worthy of fine dining. There’s even avocado toast at breakfast. Of course there is.

“Mr. Manafort has said from the beginning neither he nor anyone else in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election,” said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort. “Finally, everyone seems to be coming to that same conclusion.”

The special counsel is also examining Mr. Flynn’s financial ties to Russia and whether he concealed lobbying he did last year for Turkey.

Mr. Cobb said none of the White House documents turned over to Mr. Mueller showed evidence that that anyone colluded with Russia, or that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. The president is fully cooperating with the special counsel, he said.

“I think the path that he chose of trying to minimize conflict and maximize cooperation is one that benefits the country as he tries to erase this cloud,” Mr. Cobb said. “Which I think he will ultimately achieve.”

He did not say when he believed that would happen, but he predicted the end of the investigation was nearing.

“I don’t think that it’s far away,” he said.

In November 2015, according to the lawyers’ report, the former security chief Mr. Bustillo met with a high-ranking Desa executive.
Mr. Bustillo returned to La Esperanza for several days at the end of February and arranged to meet with the same executive on March 2.
After the killing, Mr. Rodríguez, the environment manager, forwarded details of the crime scene report that police had provided to one of the company’s executives.","“The existing proof is conclusive regarding the participation of numerous state agents, high-ranking executives and employees of Desa in the planning, execution and cover-up of the assassination,” the lawyers wrote.

Desa has repeatedly denied any involvement in Ms. Cáceres’ death or any connection to “acts of violence and intimidation.”

Eight suspects are in custody, including Sergio Rodríguez Orellana, the social and environment manager for the company, and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a retired Honduran Army lieutenant who was Desa’s director of security until mid-2015.

“What the public ministry has yet to do is indict the people who hired Bustillo to plan the operation,” said Miguel Ángel Urbina Martínez, one of the lawyers reviewing the case at the request of Ms. Cáceres’s family. The lawyers’ report, which The New York Times has obtained, will be released Tuesday.

The government’s investigation, by an elite unit in the Honduran attorney general’s office, remains open, although the lawyers’ group said there was no sign that it had progressed beyond the eight suspects.

Two American advisers, a retired homicide detective and a former federal prosecutor, have been working with Honduran authorities since the first days of the inquiry, part of an effort by the United States Embassy to push the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández to solve high-profile criminal cases.

Many of those cases involve powerful groups that critics say operate beyond the law. “The great challenge for Honduras is to dismantle these parallel forces,” said Mr. Urbina, a criminal justice expert from Guatemala and an adviser on judicial reform.

To prepare the report, Mr. Urbina’s group examined some 40,000 pages of text messages, which were retrieved by Honduran government investigators from three cellphones, one seized at Desa’s offices and two used by Mr. Rodríguez and Mr. Bustillo.

The messages, according to the report, show that the two men remained in frequent contact with three high-ranking Desa executives as they tracked the movements of Ms. Cáceres and other members of her organization, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, known as Copinh.

The conversations reveal, the lawyers said, that the orders to threaten Copinh and sabotage its protests came from Desa executives who were exercising control over security forces in the area, issuing instructions and paying for police units’ food, lodging and radio equipment.

“There was this criminal structure comprised of company executives and employees, state agents and criminal gangs that used violence, threats and intimidation,” said Roxanna Altholz, the associate director of the Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the lawyers’ group.

The other members of the legal team are a former war crimes prosecutor, Dan Saxon, and two Colombian prosecutors who have tried human rights cases, Jorge E. Molano Rodríguez and Liliana María Uribe Tirado. They have been working on the case for a year, traveling to Honduras to conduct interviews and review case material.

The lawyers were chosen by Bertha Zúñiga, Ms. Cáceres’s daughter, with recommendations from the Center for Justice and International Law, a Latin American human rights organization.

The text messages were handed over to Ms. Cáceres’s family this May on the orders of a judge after Honduran prosecutors canceled four appointments to share their findings.

The question, Ms. Altholz said, was why the prosecutor’s office, which seized the phones in April and May last year, had failed to act on “the quality and the amount of information” that “it has had in its possession for the last year and a half.”

A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said he could not comment immediately.

For Ms. Cáceres’s daughter, the content of the messages only reinforces the sense that Desa’s executives felt untouchable. “They were so confident of impunity that they talked openly,” Ms. Zúñiga said.

The company has come to the defense of its employee, Mr. Rodríguez, the environmental manager. He is “a family man, honest and hard-working, who is unjustly deprived of his freedom,” Desa’s dam division, Agua Zarca Hydroelectric, said in an unsigned email. The company “completely trusts in the innocence of Mr. Rodríguez.”

Desa obtained a concession to build a dam on the Gualcarque River in western Honduras in 2009. By law the company was required to consult with the Lenca community, but Copinh opposed the project from the beginning, arguing that the dam would jeopardize the community’s water resources and livelihood.

From the start, Desa was an odd creation, said Juan Jiménez Mayor, the head of an anti-corruption commission backed by the Organization of American States. It had only $1,200 in equity when it won the dam concession, along with operating permits, water rights and a contract to sell power to the state electricity company.

In 2011, members of the Atala family, one of the most influential in Honduras, injected millions of dollars into the company and joined the board. Mr. Jiménez’ commission has begun to investigate Desa’s contracts, a move that drew an angry response from Honduran business groups.

Copinh fought the dam on several fronts. It filed legal challenges, led community meetings and brought a case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which ordered the Honduran government to provide protective measures for Ms. Cáceres. She had been receiving death threats and knew they were serious. Four members of Copinh were killed in 2013 and 2014.

In 2015, she won the Goldman Environmental Prize, which is awarded to grass-roots environmental leaders. But it was not enough to protect her.

In November 2015, according to the lawyers’ report, the former security chief Mr. Bustillo met with a high-ranking Desa executive. In January, he visited La Esperanza and later obtained a gun through Mariano Díaz Chávez, a former Honduran special forces officer who is accused of organizing the hit squad that assassinated Ms. Cáceres.

An attempt to kill Ms. Cáceres was planned for early February but called off, the lawyers said. “Mission aborted today,” Mr. Bustillo wrote to a Desa executive. “Yesterday, we couldn’t.”

The report did not name the Desa executives because they have not been charged by Honduran authorities.

Mr. Bustillo returned to La Esperanza for several days at the end of February and arranged to meet with the same executive on March 2. Early on March 3, after Ms. Cáceres was killed, Mr. Bustillo called him again.

After the killing, Mr. Rodríguez, the environment manager, forwarded details of the crime scene report that police had provided to one of the company’s executives.

Lower Ninth Ward

Travel east through the city’s French Quarter, Faubourg Marigny and Bywater neighborhoods and you’ll reach the Lower Ninth Ward. The Industrial Canal, which connects Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River and allows cargo ships to pass, essentially cuts off the neighborhood from the rest of the city. This forged a unique culture in the area, which was largely swampland and was drained at the turn of the 20th century, with mostly working-class residents settling the land.

The Domino family lived in a narrow shotgun house on Jourdan Avenue that no longer exists, within sight of the eastern levee of the canal. In his book, Mr. Coleman describes how Mr. Domino “walked the dirt path of Jourdan Avenue to St. Claude Street, lighted in those days only by oil lamps in the houses and the stars above.”

Mr. Domino was rather shy as a child and left formal schooling during the fourth grade. He then had a succession of jobs, from an ice deliveryman helper to stable boy at the New Orleans Fair Grounds to coffee factory worker. During this time, Mr. Domino also learned how to play the piano, a pivotal part of his young life that would come to define his long career.

Even while Mr. Domino was achieving dizzying success, touring the country extensively and embarking on his first European tour in 1962, he preferred to keep his roots in New Orleans.

New Orleanians often spotted Mr. Domino driving around the city in his pink Cadillac. For decades, he resided in the Lower Ninth Ward at 1208 Caffin Avenue with his wife, Rosemary, who died in 2008. The property consists of a shotgun-style building and a corner building trimmed in pink. With a sign that reads “Fats Domino Publishing” and the initials F and D on the front of the home, this landmark property is easily identifiable.

In 1965, Hurricane Betsy brought severe flooding to the neighborhood after the levee protection system was breached. In 2005, flooding from Hurricane Katrina levee breaches was even more catastrophic, emptying the Lower Ninth Ward of much of its population, including Mr. Domino. Many buildings from his young adulthood were razed after they were deemed inhabitable. After initially riding out the storm, Mr. Domino had to be rescued by boat and subsequently decided to live with one of his daughters in Harvey, on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish.

After Mr. Domino’s death, the Lower Ninth Ward property quickly became a makeshift memorial, with admirers visiting to pay their respects and leave personal mementos to commemorate his life. The property presents an opportunity to see a slice of the city that has dealt with a great deal of tumult, but also one that always embraced Mr. Domino and paved the way for his first forays into rhythm and blues.

Central Business District

Canal Street, with its swaying palm trees and bustling streetcar lines, serves as a grand gateway to the heart of the city. In Mr. Domino’s heyday, the street also showcased the dichotomy between the bustling economic engine of the city, and at the time, lower-to-middle black class areas like the Lower Ninth Ward.

The lyrics to “Fat Man” highlight the busy corner of Rampart and Canal, where the black and white worlds of the city, respectively, merge:

I was standin’, I was standin’ on the corner Of Rampart and Canal I was watchin’, watchin’ Watchin’ all these Creole gals

Mr. Domino deftly references Creole culture, acknowledging the mixed-race women who descended from free black citizens. The lyric is a continued recognition of the somewhat fragile racial realities of the time, as well as a nod to his own background.

French Quarter

At the intersection of Rampart Street and Dumaine Street, on the northern edge of the French Quarter, a nondescript laundromat is in the former home of the J&M Recording Studio. The studio, opened by the recording engineer Cosimo Matassa, was designated as a Historic Rock and Roll Landmark by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2010, with songs including “Fat Man” and Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight” having been recorded at the location. Mr. Coleman describes the recording session for “Fat Man” as lasting almost six hours, which was not unusual for Mr. Domino, as he generally practiced his songs religiously.

In the Central Business District and straddling the border with the French Quarter is the old State Palace Theater, which operated as a Loew’s Theater during Mr. Domino’s adolescence. The original building, which was constructed in 1926 and features over 3,000 seats, remains intact, but redevelopment plans remain unclear. Mr. Domino went to the State Palace frequently in the 1940s.

“I used to see Gene Autry movies all the time,” Mr. Domino told Mr. Coleman, adding that he also saw “Roy Rogers, the Three Musketeers, and John Wayne.”

The nearby Civic, Joy and Orpheum Theaters, which all rose to prominence from the late 1900s to the ‘40s, underwent extensive renovations and continue to welcome new generations of audiences.

Mr. Domino’s performances in the 1990s and early 2000s at the House of Blues were highly anticipated and well-received, a testament to his enormous staying power.

New Orleans

Mr. Domino was a master at fusing music genres like rhythm and blues, jazz, boogie-woogie, gospel and even country. His love for New Orleans always remained a major theme in his musical universe. Performances at the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, fittingly held at the Fair Grounds where he once worked as a boy, always brought out legions of his fans. In his later years he played to smaller crowds, including a 2007 set at Tipitina’s Uptown, one of his last public performances.

In the song, “Walking to New Orleans,” Mr. Domino describes the sense of belonging and optimism that the city holds. Despite the sad circumstances, the song is upbeat and refreshingly personal:

I’ve got no time for talkin’ I’ve got to keep on walkin’ New Orleans is my home That’s the reason why I’m goin’ Yes, I’m walkin’ to New Orleans I’m walkin’ to New Orleans

At the time of Mr. Domino’s death, he was 89 years old. New Orleans shaped his work ethic and songwriting throughout his life, a testament to his ability to connect people through music.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Smithwick’s adviser, Jakob Vinther, went to China and took high resolution images of Sinosauropteryx specimens under specially polarized light, which brought out their colors.

The dark feathers — the only ones that were preserved on the fossils — were filled with melanin, the same pigment that colors our hair and skin. It is a strong molecule that is resistant to decay and can survive in fossils for hundreds of millions of years.

Mr. Smithwick mapped the pigmented feathers on the fossils, finding that the Sinosauropteryx had brownish feathers covering its back and sides that stopped about halfway down its body. The rest of the feathers were most likely lightly colored.

The color pattern is a form of camouflage known as “countershading,” and on the Sinosauropteryx the transition from dark to light happened relatively high on the body. Mr. Smithwick said that the pattern could provide insight into the type of environment where the dinosaur lived.

He made 3D models of the dinosaur’s color shading and tested them under different types of light to see where they would perform best as camouflage. He found that the pattern was most useful in open environments where sunlight is coming straight from above with little interference.

When sunlight illuminates an animal’s top, it also keeps its underside in shadow, he said. This means that when something is looking at it, whether a predator or prey, the animal is seen as a three-dimensional object.

More Reporting on Paleontology

But countershading distorts the shadows in a way that makes the animal look less three-dimensional, and harder to spot. Animals that live in open, grassy environments have sharp transitions high on their body, from dark to light. But those that live in wooded or forested areas, like deer, tend to have a more gradual transition that appears much lower on the body.

The research suggests that countershading is not a modern evolutionary development, but a timeless camouflage technique.

Mr. Smithwick added that the dark feathers around the eyes indicate that Sinosauropteryx had “bandit masks,” most famously seen in raccoons, but also in some badgers, ferrets and red pandas.

Researchers tend to think mammals use the patches as warning signs that tell predators they are aggressive and not to be messed with. But Mr. Smithwick thinks Sinosauropteryx used its eye patches either as camouflage or to block glare, like athletes who paint dark stripes under their eyes to reduce incoming sunlight.

Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the study, said the research was a leap forward in paleontologists’ understanding of Sinosauropteryx.

“We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped,” Dr. Brusatte said in an email. “These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.”",A Turkey-Size Dinosaur With a Raccoon-Like Bandit Mask,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/science/dinosaur-raccoon-bandit-mask.html

It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted.

At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers.

On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans.

Health care sabotage.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

The center-right Revival Party lost seats it had won last year, clinging to just four seats. Bright Future Party, a hipsterish party whose members shun the idea of becoming career politicians, lost every one of its four seats.

One unlikely winner among the smaller parties was the former prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s newly formed Center Party. His dark-horse campaign led his populist outfit to secure seven seats.

Mr. Gunnlaugsson won more than 10 percent of the vote, deploying his eccentric charisma to good effect and campaigning on a platform that promised to squeeze the banks and divvy up the proceeds for nationwide infrastructure.

“Gunnlaugsson’s politics follow the general trend we have seen lately in Western democracies towards anti-elitism, simplistic solutions and forms of nationalism,” said Jon Ormur Halldorsson, a political scientist at Reykjavik University.

The former prime minister was forced out of the government last year after the leaked Panama Papers revealed that Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s family had offshore holdings in the British Virgin Islands, setting off widespread protests over his perceived tax avoidance.

The scandal led to the collapse of the government and to early elections.

His Center Party, however, has now emerged as the fourth-largest, pushing the anti-establishment Icelandic Pirate Party down to sixth place with six seats.

It was a different reality from last year’s election results for the Pirates, a ragtag group of futurists, anarchists and hackers. In 2016, it surged to become Iceland’s third-largest party, largely because of an electorate disillusioned by traditional politics and scandals like Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s downfall.

Opinion polls had predicted that the environmentalist Left-Green Movement, a pacifist group that opposes Iceland’s membership in NATO, might emerge as the largest party and that its popular and charismatic leader, Katrin Jakobsdottir, would become the country’s fourth prime minister in two years.

But the polls were off the mark. The party, which had vowed to adopt a new constitution partly crowdsourced via social media, gained one seat to emerge with 11 — well short of expectations.

Such a mixed result opens up a kaleidoscope of coalition possibilities. Eight parties have entered the Althing in this election. After last year’s vote, it took months for a coalition to be brokered.

Mr. Halldorsson said that coalition talks might not play out so favorably for Mr. Gunnlaugsson despite his ambitions to become a kingmaker.

He is “an isolated figure,” Mr. Halldorsson said, one who “very few would relish working with.”

A more likely coalition partner, observers say, is the revived Social Democratic Party, a former establishment mainstay that had been badly punished in previous elections, and that has returned from electoral oblivion with seven seats. The party now shares the position of third-largest party with Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s Center Party.

In this small volcanic island of 340,000, where voter turnout is generally high, the participation this year stood at a little over 81 percent.

One newcomer, the anti-immigrant People’s Party, defied the polls to get its first foothold in the Althing with four seats.

Iceland has seen voter dissatisfaction surge in the face of multiple scandals. Mr. Benediktsson called early elections last month after his government collapsed because of accusations a cover-up of a letter of recommendation written by a prime minister’s father on behalf of a convicted child-sex offender.

One of his administration’s partners, Bright Future, quit the coalition. The government had been formed a mere 10 months before, born of early elections called after Mr. Gunnlaugsson’s abrupt resignation.

One bright spot: The country has managed to recover from the brutal aftermath of the global financial collapse of 2008. But the political landscape is fraught with scandals.

Mr. Halldorsson, the political scientist, said, “Although the economy has fully recovered, the political crisis set in motion by the economic collapse in 2008 continues to deepen.

“The main message of the elections is that business as usual is no longer an option for the political system. What may be required is more use of direct democracy and far more transparency in government business and dealings between parties.”",Iceland’s Independence Party Retains Most Seats After Election,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/world/europe/iceland-election.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States.","Mr. Hackett’s predecessor, Mark Fields, was ousted in May after he failed to deliver the high-tech strategy that investors were eager to see for future growth.

Mr. Hackett has reorganized his management team with an eye toward incremental improvements in the more mundane aspects of the business, such as cutting material costs and streamlining production, as a prelude to making larger investments in electric-powered models driven by computers. It also announced a long list of senior management appointments and departures this week.

“We are committed to transforming our business,” Mr. Hackett said of his company’s efforts to bring new driverless technology to market. Yet he seemed most proud on Thursday that Ford had achieved 8 percent operating margins on vehicles it builds and sells in the North American market.

That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.

It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.

For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid — but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.

Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.

Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.

The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company’s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. “Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn’t make money,” the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford’s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.

But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.

Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement — which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico — could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.

Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.

Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.

Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation’s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.

The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group. But G.M. reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.

G.M.’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated “the resilience of our core business” in the face of declining consumer demand. “This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,” he said.

But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. “The market is more challenging than expected,” Mr. Stevens said.

Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.

The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.

Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. “Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally,” she said.

And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.

They’re hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I don’t feel like it’s appropriate that I have those conversations with them.

You’re like a cool uncle.

Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy who’s able to be on set saying, “All right, come on kids, let’s get down to work.” So in some ways I’m a cool uncle, and in some ways I’m like a nasty physics teacher.

Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?

No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to. One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didn’t want to become the dad on “Full House,” or whatever, who’s just a dad. Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce — you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.

You’ve said that you were once told that you were “too fat” to play the Blob. Now you’re playing a shirtless superhero. How hard is it to maintain a healthy body image as a man in Hollywood?

The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool — I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff. And I really couldn’t get that much work.

Then “Stranger Things” came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, “O.K. I’m going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.” And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism. In that first scene [in Season 1], where he’s shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: “Come on, this guy doesn’t work out. Play the character. Don’t play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.”

And that was where things turned around for me. It was like, “Oh, people want to see real human beings,” and I’ve been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country.
Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention?
This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment.
More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough.
In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing.","Remember Anita Hill, who told a firing line of skeptical senators the story of constant harassment by her boss, Clarence Thomas, more than 25 years ago. The lawmakers, every one of them male, seemed less concerned with the alleged misconduct of a Supreme Court nominee than that a woman would drag such a tawdry subject into the halls of Congress. While Ms. Hill’s brave testimony prompted a sharp rise in sexual-harassment claims, she was vilified in public; nearly twice as many Americans said at the time that they believed now-Justice Thomas’s account of what happened over hers.

Remember former President Bill Clinton, whose popularity endures despite a long string of allegations of sexual misconduct and, in one case, rape — all of which he has denied. Mr. Clinton did eventually admit to the affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, that nearly toppled his presidency, but he pointed out that it was not illegal.

Then, of course, there’s the current occupant of the Oval Office, who won the election only weeks after the public heard him brag about grabbing women’s genitalia, and who once said that if his daughter were ever sexually harassed at work, she should go find a new job. That president leads a party intent on passing laws that would re-establish gender norms and hierarchies from the middle of the last century (Defund Planned Parenthood! No abortions after six weeks!) — making it harder for women to attain the social equality and economic independence that would go a long way toward reducing sexual harassment in the workplace.

In other words, even the highest-profile opportunities to change America’s endemic culture of sexual harassment, which is overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, committed by men against women, can somehow be lost or swept away. How do we keep that from happening again?

And how do we ensure that progress filters down to average American workplaces, where sexual harassment occurs all the time but rarely gets media attention? The answer is part cultural, part economic and part legal.

The most conservative estimates say 25 percent of women have experienced sexual harassment at work, although the real number is surely much higher, since only a small fraction of such behavior is ever reported. As many as 90 percent of workers who are harassed never file a formal complaint, according to a 2016 report by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which receives more than 12,000 complaints of sex-based harassment each year.

The reasons for this silence are obvious: Women fear retaliation, indifference or disbelief if they speak up. If it’s hard for rich and famous people, so many of whom kept silent in the face of Mr. Weinstein’s well-known depredations, imagine how much harder it is for someone with no political or economic power. But the Weinstein saga also illustrates what a difference it can make when women join together — and men join with them — to confront harassers openly.

HOW TO CHANGE THE CULTURE The key is to foster work environments where women feel safe and men feel obliged to report sexual harassment. “People need to be afraid not just of doing these things, but also of not doing anything when someone around them does it,” Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, told The Times’s Nicholas Kristof last week. “If you know something is happening and you fail to take action, whether you are a man or a woman — especially when you are in power — you are responsible, too.”

But speaking up only goes so far if employers don’t make reporting harassment easy or the consequences for harassers swift and clear. Treating sexual harassment seriously is essential, not to protect against liability or to safeguard the bottom line, but because it’s wrong for anyone to have to endure harassment at work. (Though it sure helps when liability and the bottom line are at stake, too.)

Some of the nation’s largest companies are moving in the right direction. For example, McDonald’s, Burger King, Aramark and Walmart have signed on to a program requiring their tomato growers to adhere to a code of conduct that prohibits sexual harassment and assault of farmworkers, and provides a clear system for the growers’ 30,000 workers to file complaints. Fourteen businesses are part of the program; many more should join.

IT’S ABOUT POWER AND MONEY Sexual-harassment culture is tied directly to the economics of the workplace. Since harassment is about power, it’s no surprise that it thrives in industries where women are systematically kept out of powerful roles — and paid less for doing the same work as men. (This may help explain why sexual-harassment cases make up nearly half of all harassment complaints from the private sector, but less than 10 percent of those from employees of the federal government, where women have more opportunities to rise to positions of authority.)

Photo

Too often, male harassers use their economic power to silence women, as Mr. Weinstein and Mr. O’Reilly did repeatedly, offering them hefty payments in return for signing nondisclosure agreements. If employers were more responsive and harassment cases were easier to pursue in the courts, there would be fewer of these settlements, which can be good for individual women but allow the predatory behavior to continue unchecked.

One compromise could be to require businesses to report how many sexual-harassment claims they settle every year, or even how many complaints they receive. This would at least give prospective employees a chance to assess how bad the problem is at a given company, and could lead to greater public scrutiny in more extreme cases.

LEGAL BARRIERS The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion and other protected classes. Twelve years later, it made employers liable for supervisors’ harassment of workers. But in 2013, the court stepped backward, ruling that employers are liable only for racial or sexual harassment by a supervisor who has the power to fire a worker or prevent his or her promotion. In a 5-to-4 ruling, with only male justices in the majority, the court held that employers are not automatically liable for harassment by the larger number of supervisors who don’t have that power, even if they control all other aspects of a worker’s daily activities.

In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the decision ignored the realities of the modern workplace, and the “particular threatening character” of a supervisor’s power and authority, even one not vested with the power to fire. A worker who confronts a harassing supervisor risks “receiving an undesirable or unsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She may be saddled with an excessive workload or with placement on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family life.”

Congress could and should overturn that ruling today by passing a law that reinstates the broader and more realistic definition of a supervisor. But good luck with that; Capitol Hill can’t even keep its own house in order. Representative Jackie Speier of California, who said she was sexually assaulted years ago when she was a congressional staff member, told Politico on Thursday that the compliance office tasked with handling harassment complaints is “toothless,” and said that Congress has been “a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.”

This may turn out to be the year when the tide finally turned on sexual harassment. The elements for a permanent cultural shift are certainly in place. More women have entered the work force, and the pay gap with men is closing, though not fast enough. More women than men are graduating from college; more are earning advanced degrees; and increasing numbers are managers, though the proportions of women still become thinner and thinner the higher in management you look. And, crucially, the internet and social media have opened a door to instant communication and community support that didn’t exist before, helping women feel less isolation and shame about their experiences, and more confident that speaking out will have a positive result.

In the end, though, the most lasting change will have to come from men, who are doing virtually all the sexual harassing.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at New York’s Leica Gallery. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.

How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election? No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened. Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.

Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy. But for Twitter — influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful — the situation is more vexing. Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.

Many of Twitter’s users have long been frustrated with the site’s scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment. Twitter’s critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.

The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitter’s most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN. Twitter’s guidelines forbid “threats of violence” and “targeted abuse” prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump’s account.

In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the company’s evolving views on hosting the president. That includes allowing tweets under the “newsworthy” label it might otherwise ban. But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting “We need to do better.”

Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump. Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the president’s Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring. “It’s too early to say we’re all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people,” he said.

There are already signs that Twitter’s bottom line is feeling the effects. An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019. Since other parts of social media — most notably Facebook — are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.

“Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities. “If you think about why are people alcoholics, it’s because they don’t acknowledge they’re alcoholics.”

He added about Twitter, “It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.”

Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year. But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.

Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected. Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.

Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week. When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it “inadequate at every level.” He added that Twitter had “failed to understand how serious this issue is.”

On Tuesday, Twitter said it would “dramatically” increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like. Political ads will be specially marked. Mr. Warner called Twitter’s plan “a good first step.”

On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they “attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.”

But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc. The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.

@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state. It billed itself as the “Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans” but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.

“We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird,” said Mr. Leatherwood. “That’s not how you abbreviate Tennessee. Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.”

The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed. “It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments,” Mr. Leatherwood said. “It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.”

Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation. He said others had as well. He never heard back.

After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trump’s firing of F.B.I. director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, “I love my whiteness. And yours.”

@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.

“I can’t tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account,” said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself. “But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.”

Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress. After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, “We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.”

When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background. One of them presented the company’s long-held philosophy: “We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.”","Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia.html

But a strong filter also creates real problems, because it effectively lies about reality to both the healthy and the sick. It lies to the healthy about the likelihood that they will one day suffer, hiding the fact that even in modernity the Book of Ecclesiastes still applies. It lies to the sick about how alone they really are, because when they were healthy that seemed like perfect normalcy, so they must now be outliers, failures, freaks.

And this deception is amplified now that so much social interaction takes place between disembodied avatars and curated selves, in a realm of Instagrammed hyper-positivity that makes suffering even more isolating than it is in the real world.

These thoughts are in my mind because I’ve been reading “Before You Wake,” by the conservative pundit Erick Erickson, a memoir addressed to his children and inspired by the descent of different life-threatening illnesses upon himself and his wife.

I found the book particularly striking because, like many people in our profession, I know Erickson virtually but not really in real life — which means, in fact, that I don’t know him, I know only the pugilistic piece of him that shows up for fights online. So reading his personal story is a small experiment in weakening the filter, in shaking off the spell of simulated life, of letting a person’s suffering give you a glimpse of them in full.

But beyond the virtual/real distinction it’s also interesting to watch a writer try to impart a sense of what a Via Dolorosa is really like, of how you make sense of it and bear it, to people he otherwise tries to protect from suffering — his children.

Because this seems to me to be the signal failing of modern education — visible among my own peers, now entering the time of life when suffering is more the weather than a lightning strike, but especially among the generation younger than us, who seem to be struggling with the contrast between what social media and meritocracy tell them they should feel and what they actually experience.

In America we have education for success, but no education for suffering. There is instead the filter, the well-meaning deception, that teaches neither religious hope nor stoicism, and when suffering arrives encourages group hysteria, private shame and a growing contagion of despair.

选择当下这段时间重新上演颇为引人遐想。是什么让你等了这么久？

你更担心的是文化影响力，而非“我们能否打造出同样有品质的东西”？

我认为这两者是相互关联的。《蝴蝶君》最初之所以能获得成功，部分原因在于当时与我合作的导演非常清楚如何利用百老汇剧院。我和[制作人]内勒·纽金特(Nelle Nugent)谈起茱莉·泰摩(Julie Taymor)的时候，真的非常兴奋。

(RED FAMINE: Stalin’s War on Ukraine)

作者：安妮·阿普尔鲍姆(Anne Applebaum)

461页。双日出版社(Doubleday)，35美元。

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

在那次旅行中，她走访的大多数人都感到自己的民族身份受到现在所属的国家的威胁、这个国家在过去曾是他们的压迫者。他们觉得自己不公平地变成了立陶宛化的波兰人，或者是白俄罗斯化了的立陶宛人或鲁塞尼亚人——鲁塞尼亚人没有自己的国家，而其他人似乎都有自己的国家。这本书很有先见之明，因为近几年崛起的政治人士精心培养的正是这种怨愤的、受伤的民族或国家自豪感，从布达佩斯的维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)、莫斯科的弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，到华盛顿的唐纳德·特朗普。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

其中一段描述来自年轻的威尔士记者加雷斯·琼斯(Gareth Jones)，1933年，他在遭受饥荒的地区徒步走了40英里，离开这个国家后，他为这场浩劫写下了一份对于西方媒体来说非常罕见的亲历实录。琼斯曾为此受到赞扬，但是关于他，阿普尔鲍姆还讲述了另一个鲜为人知的故事：琼斯说出自己的经历之后，斯大林政府成功采取强硬手段，令英美驻莫斯科记者出言否认他所说的一切——尽管这些记者当中有些人还是琼斯的消息来源，把如果由他们自己报道就会遭到审查的信息透露给他。这个故事提醒人们，政客为了封锁或扭曲真相可以做出多么过分的行径——如今在很多国家，这个问题的严重性都不亚于80年前的苏联。

Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds.
For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months.","The rapid rise of Mr. Muzinich, a lanky father of two from Manhattan, is emblematic of the new power dynamics in Mr. Trump’s Washington, where business experience and New York roots are often pathways to top posts. He fits the mold of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, both of whom made a career on Wall Street. While not a Goldman Sachs alumnus, as they are, he brings an extensive background from the world of finance, having been a banker at Morgan Stanley and the president of Muzinich & Co., an international investment firm founded by his father.

Yet for all the intricacies of Wall Street finance, Mr. Muzinich has had to scale a steep learning curve in understanding the peculiarities of the tax code and the legislative land mines that have roiled previous attempts to rewrite tax law. Some lobbyists have expressed frustration that Mr. Muzinich and his Treasury team have been overly secretive about the tax plan and that, despite his business background, he does not always appear enthusiastic to be haggling over tax code deductions with representatives of American industries.

A congressional tax staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings said that it had sometimes been evident that Mr. Muzinich was learning on the job in a world of tax and accounting technicians, but added that he had a strong sense of business economics, asked smart questions and was comfortable with data.

His Wall Street brashness sometimes shines through when he gets into deal-making mode. Like other political newcomers in the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich has occasionally shown frustration with the grinding pace of legislating.

On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn’s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration’s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.

“Justin’s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration’s top domestic priority,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.

Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump’s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.

Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush’s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a “territorial” tax system, as the current plan would also do.

“What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he’s just a policy wonk,” Mr. Bush said in an interview. “Justin has a desire to serve and he’s getting to do it at a high level, and I’m really proud of him for doing it.”

Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich, who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve. Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of “America First.” In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Mr. Muzinich and a co-author, Eric Werker, called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid.

Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, called the idea clever at the time but suggested that such a concept would be panned as the “outsource American jobs to third-world sweatshops tax credit.”

Mr. Muzinich has also written extensively on issues that extend far beyond taxes. In 2010, he wrote a long essay for the Hoover Institution on modernizing nuclear nonproliferation strategy in international waters.

He grew up and studied in Democratic havens like New York City and Harvard, but Mr. Muzinich’s conservative leanings were obvious at an early age. Former colleagues describe his views on tax policy as center-right, with a focus on spurring economic growth by broadening the base of taxpayers and lowering tax rates.

Like many officials who have joined the Trump administration, Mr. Muzinich is straddling two worlds. His wife, a doctor, and young children still live in New York, and he spends his weeks living out of hotels in Washington and commuting home to the Upper East Side on the weekends. A squash enthusiast, Mr. Muzinich has little time for the courts amid the crush of meetings and number crunching, according to friends who keep in regular touch with him.

While many members of the Trump administration have become household names defending the president and his policies on television, Mr. Muzinich, who declined to be interviewed, has kept his distance from public political combat and maintained a low profile.

“I think that he is pragmatic,” said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, where Mr. Muzinich taught before joining the Treasury Department. “He’s looking for good policy solutions, not policy positions.”

Critics have accused the Treasury Department of taking a different approach. Some economists have scoffed at Mr. Mnuchin’s promises that tax cuts would more than pay for themselves because of the robust economic growth he says they will create. The department came under fire for removing from its web site an economic study that contradicted the secretary’s analysis of the benefits of corporate tax cuts.

Yet Mr. Muzinich’s reputation for pragmatism over ideology is providing comfort for those who know him and disagree with the direction of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

“I’m really happy that someone like Justin is working in the administration, because to have thoughtful, level-headed people who are open to evidence, and who are able to bring complicated issues together, I think leaves us better off four years later,” said Mr. Werker, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who collaborated with Mr. Muzinich on writing projects at Harvard but is not a Republican.

For now, Mr. Muzinich will be consumed with tax rates and distribution tables as he tries to help shepherd tax legislation to Mr. Trump’s desk in less than three months. Early analyses of the Republican tax plan have found that it would disproportionately benefit the rich, but the Trump administration is working with tax writers in Congress to make the legislation more progressive.

The final shape of the tax plan remains to be seen, but Mr. Taylor, who said that Mr. Muzinich was an above-average student in his Advanced Placement calculus class, is holding out hope that his former pupil will find a way to ensure that the poor are not forgotten.

“I see him in these pictures marching behind Mnuchin and I say, ‘Oh, Justin, put in a good word for us,’” Mr. Taylor, a self-described liberal, said. “I think people should be caring about other people.”",The Little-Known Pragmatist Who Is Shaping the Trump Tax Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/the-little-known-pragmatist-who-is-shaping-the-trump-tax-cuts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.
Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue.
Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out.
Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.","“This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s really, really easy not to take them.” He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink — advice the president said he had heeded.

“We are going to overcome addiction in America,” the president said.

The designation of a public health crisis, formally made by Eric D. Hargan, the acting health secretary, would allow for some grant money to be used to combat opioid abuse, permit the hiring of specialists to tackle the crisis, and expand the use of telemedicine services to treat people in rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump said his plan would include a requirement that federally employed prescribers be trained in safe practices for opioid prescriptions, and a new federal initiative to develop nonaddictive painkillers, as well as intensified efforts to block shipments of fentanyl, a cheap and extremely potent synthetic opioid manufactured in China, into the United States.

He also said he would act to suspend a rule that currently prevents Medicaid from funding many drug rehabilitation facilities.

“We cannot allow this to continue,” Mr. Trump said. “It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.”

Congressional Republicans as well as law enforcement and physicians’ groups said the president’s announcement was a crucial first step in building awareness about the opioid crisis and confronting its causes and devastating effects.

In a statement, Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the American Medical Association’s opioid task force, described it as “a move that will offer needed flexibility and help direct attention to opioid-ravaged communities.”

“There is plenty of work ahead,” Dr. Harris added, “and the emergency declaration adds further urgency to this epidemic.”

But Democrats criticized Mr. Trump for what they characterized as a tepid response to an urgent calamity, arguing that his failure to request funding for the effort revealed a lack of seriousness about addressing the issue.

“America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half-measures.”

Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, said that no emergency declaration would do much to alleviate the impact of opioids without a substantial commitment of federal money and a clear strategy for overhauling the way the country treats addiction.

“What we need is for the president to seek an appropriation from Congress, I believe in the billions, so that we can rapidly expand access for effective outpatient opioid addiction treatments,” Dr. Kolodny said in an interview. “Until those treatments are easier to access than heroin or fentanyl, overdose deaths will remain at record-high levels.”

Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to a crucial victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year. As president, he appointed an opioid commission in March, installing Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race, as chairman.

In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.

Although Mr. Trump called the opioid crisis a national emergency over the next month, he did not sign a formal declaration of the designation, and the idea ran into stiff resistance in his administration to making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with an issue that has shown no signs of abating.

Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue. They said the White House would soon send Congress a request for money to combat opioids, with the goal of including it in a year-end spending package.

Mr. Christie praised the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out. That includes a “drug czar” to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of health and human services who would tailor policies and identify sources of funding.

Among the questions left unanswered by the president’s announcement is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will use its authority under the public health declaration to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.

Jim Hood, a founder and the chief executive of Facing Addiction, who lost his 20-year-old son, Austin, to an accidental overdose five years to the day before Mr. Trump’s announcement, said he was grateful that the president took the time to talk about a crisis that had too often been ignored, but worried that his message missed the mark.

“That undercurrent that if all of you just decided not to do this, we’d be in a better place — I can tell you, my son did not decide that he wanted to become addicted, much less die,” Mr. Hood said. “We might have been much better served by framing this as a very serious illness, a very serious health issue.”",Trump Declares Opioid Crisis a ‘Health Emergency’ but Requests No Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned her, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, who Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly enraged child advocates. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

The United States is in the throes of a great debate: Do we want — can we afford — to remain a safe haven for people who, unlike economic migrants, come here running for their lives? This year the administration slashed the number of refugees the United States will allow by more than half.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s whom we are turning our backs on first.

Ms. Gonzalez is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by the police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state fees. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she said, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who wakes up screaming with nightmares and crawls into bed with her — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Ms. Gonzalez is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Ms. Gonzalez and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress get rid of a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers — they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent, a remedy that has been the most successful path for these children to get legal status.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian be allowed to spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes in the United States as the authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a Border Patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that Border Patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have identified hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that Border Patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration curtailed a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. When that policy change was made, some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the addresses and names of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

Amid all this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, said Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally.

But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are appearing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

The Japanese public is largely opposed to nuclear weapons with polls indicating fewer than one in 10 support nuclear armament.","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has campaigned for a military buildup against the threat from the North, and Japan sits on a stockpile of nuclear material that could power an arsenal of 6,000 weapons. Last Sunday, he won a commanding majority in parliamentary elections, fueling his hopes of revising the nation’s pacifist Constitution.

This brutal calculus over how to respond to North Korea is taking place in a region where several nations have the material, the technology, the expertise and the money to produce nuclear weapons.

Beyond South Korea and Japan, there is already talk in Australia, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam about whether it makes sense to remain nuclear-free if others arm themselves — heightening fears that North Korea could set off a chain reaction in which one nation after another feels threatened and builds the bomb.

In a recent interview, Henry A. Kissinger, one of the few nuclear strategists from the early days of the Cold War still living, said he had little doubt where things were headed.

“If they continue to have nuclear weapons,” he said of North Korea, “nuclear weapons must spread in the rest of Asia.”

“It cannot be that North Korea is the only Korean country in the world that has nuclear weapons, without the South Koreans trying to match it. Nor can it be that Japan will sit there,” he added. “So therefore we’re talking about nuclear proliferation.”

Such fears have been raised before, in Asia and elsewhere, without materializing, and the global consensus against the spread of nuclear weapons is arguably stronger than ever.

But North Korea is testing America’s nuclear umbrella — its commitment to defend its allies with nuclear weapons if necessary — in a way no nation has in decades. Similar fears of abandonment in the face of the Soviet Union’s growing arsenal helped lead Britain and France to go nuclear in the 1950s.

President Trump, who leaves Nov. 3 for a visit to Asia, has intensified these insecurities in the region. During his presidential campaign, he spoke openly of letting Japan and South Korea build nuclear arms even as he argued they should pay more to support the American military bases there.

“There is going to be a point at which we just can’t do this anymore,” he told The New York Times in March 2016. Events, he insisted, were pushing both nations toward their own nuclear arsenals anyway.

Mr. Trump has not raised that possibility in public since taking office. But he has rattled the region by engaging in bellicose rhetoric against North Korea and dismissing talks as a “waste of time.”

In Seoul and Tokyo, many have already concluded that North Korea will keep its nuclear arsenal, because the cost of stopping it will be too great — and they are weighing their options.

Capability to Build the Bomb

Long before North Korea detonated its first nuclear device, several of its neighbors secretly explored going nuclear themselves.

Japan briefly considered building a “defensive” nuclear arsenal in the 1960s despite its pacifist Constitution. South Korea twice pursued the bomb in the 1970s and 1980s, and twice backed down under American pressure. Even Taiwan ran a covert nuclear program before the United States shut it down.

Today, there is no question that both South Korea and Japan have the material and expertise to build a weapon.

All that is stopping them is political sentiment and the risk of international sanctions. Both nations signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but it is unclear how severely other countries would punish two of the world’s largest economies for violating the agreement.

South Korea has 24 nuclear reactors and a huge stockpile of spent fuel from which it can extract plutonium — enough for more than 4,300 bombs, according to a 2015 paper by Charles D. Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists.

Japan once pledged never to stockpile more nuclear fuel than it can burn off. But it has never completed the necessary recycling and has 10 tons of plutonium stored domestically and another 37 tons overseas.

“We keep reminding the Japanese of their pledge,” said Ernest J. Moniz, chief executive of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and an energy secretary in the Obama administration, noting that it would take years if not decades for Japan to consume its fissile material because almost all its nuclear plants have remained offline since the 2011 Fukushima accident.

China, in particular, has objected to Japan’s stockpile, warning that its traditional rival is so advanced technologically that it could use the material to quickly build a large arsenal.

Analysts often describe Japan as a “de facto” nuclear state, capable of building a weapon within a year or two. “Building a physical device is not that difficult anymore,” said Tatsujiro Suzuki, former deputy chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission.

Japan already possesses long-range missile technology, he added, but would need some time to develop more sophisticated communications and control systems.

South Korea may be even further along, with a fleet of advanced missiles that carry conventional warheads. In 2004, the government disclosed that its scientists had dabbled in reprocessing and enriching nuclear material without first informing the International Atomic Energy Agency as required by treaty.

“If we decide to stand on our own feet and put our resources together, we can build nuclear weapons in six months,” said Suh Kune-yull, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University. “The question is whether the president has the political will.”

In Seoul, a Rising Call for Arms

President Moon Jae-in has been firm in his opposition to nuclear weapons. He insists that building them or reintroducing American ones to South Korea would make it even more difficult to persuade North Korea to scrap its own.

Though Mr. Moon has received high approval ratings since his election in May, his view is increasingly a minority one.

Calls for nuclear armament used to be dismissed as chatter from South Korea’s nationalist fringe. Not anymore. Now people often complain that South Korea cannot depend on the United States, its protector of seven decades.

The opposition Liberty Korea party called on the United States to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea in August after the North tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of reaching the mainland United States.

“If the U.N. Security Council can’t rein in North Korea with its sanctions, we will have no option but to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty,” Won Yoo-chul, a party leader, said in September.

Given the failure of sanctions, threats and negotiations to stop North Korea, South Koreans are increasingly convinced the North will never give up its nuclear weapons. But they also oppose risking a war with a military solution.

Most believe the Trump administration, despite its tough talk, will ultimately acquiesce, perhaps settling for a freeze that allows the North to keep a small arsenal. And many fear that would mean giving the North the ultimate blackmail tool — and a way to keep the United States at bay.

“The reason North Korea is developing a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles is not to go to war with the United States,” said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “It’s to stop the Americans from intervening in armed skirmishes or full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula.”

The closer the North gets to showing it can strike the United States, the more nervous South Koreans become about being abandoned. Some have asked whether Washington will risk the destruction of an American city by intervening, for example, if the North attempts to occupy a border island, as its soldiers have practiced.

For many in South Korea, the solution is a homegrown nuclear deterrent.

“If we don’t respond with our own nuclear deterrence of some kind, our people will live like nuclear hostages of North Korea,” said Cheon Seong-whun, a former presidential secretary for security strategy.

With nuclear weapons of its own, the South would gain leverage and could force North Korea back to the bargaining table, where the two sides could whittle down their arsenals through negotiations, some hawks argue.

But given the risks of going nuclear, others say Seoul should focus on persuading Washington to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons.

“The redeployment of American tactical nuclear weapons would be the surest way” to deter North Korea, Defense Minister Song Young-moo said last month, but he added that it would be difficult to get Washington to agree to that.

In Tokyo, Cautious Debate

The discussion in Japan has been more subdued than in South Korea, no surprise after 70 years of public education about the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

But Japan has periodically considered developing nuclear weapons every decade since the 1960s.

In 2002, a top aide to Junichiro Koizumi, the prime minister then, caused a furor by suggesting Japan might one day break with its policy of never building, possessing or allowing nuclear arms on its territory.

North Korea has reopened that question.

Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister seen as a potential challenger to Prime Minister Abe, has argued that Japan needs to debate its nuclear policy given the threat from North Korea.

Mr. Abe has stopped short of calling for a re-evaluation of the country’s position on nuclear weapons. But he has increased military spending and echoed Mr. Trump’s hawkish position against the North.

Mr. Abe’s administration has already determined that nuclear weapons would not be prohibited under the Constitution if maintained only for self-defense.

The Japanese public is largely opposed to nuclear weapons with polls indicating fewer than one in 10 support nuclear armament.

But Japan’s relations with South Korea have long been strained, and if Seoul armed itself, those numbers could shift.

Some analysts say the discussion is aimed at getting additional reassurance from Washington. “We always do that when we become a little upset about the credibility of the extended U.S. deterrence,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.

Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy, said Japan would rethink its position on nuclear weapons if it suspects the United States would let it down.

“We’re kind of in uncharted waters as far as this goes,” he said. “It’s hard to know exactly what the threshold is that will lead the Japanese public’s switch to flip.”",North Korea Rouses Neighbors to Reconsider Nuclear Weapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-japan-south-korea.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A political party in New Zealand must pay Eminem’s music publisher $413,000 (600,000 New Zealand dollars) for infringing on the copyright of his hit song “Lose Yourself,” a court in Wellington ruled.

The National Party of New Zealand had been sued in 2014 by the publisher, Eight Mile Style, over a song featured in one of its campaign ads that echoed the rapper’s Grammy and Oscar-winning 2002 smash.

The name of the song? “Eminem Esque.”

A representative for Eminem said that the artist was not himself a party to the lawsuit and has no comment.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

‘I called the police last week.’

Some women are reporting crimes and abuses when they hadn’t before.

I was raped by my boss on a business trip in 2015. He was terminated after I told H.R., but they also advised me not to say anything because he might sue me. I chose to leave the company, and I was too distraught and scared to go to the police.

It has taken me two years of therapy to figure out how to move on. I had planned to call the police before the Weinstein story broke, actually; but the wave of solidarity became an anchor of strength.

I called the police last week and am waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective. I know I won’t find my peace through celebrity, money or even through the justice system. But I can use my voice to join the chorus and ask for this to stop.

So when the owners of East River Tattoo fired back on Instagram, posting a screen shot of the Yelp review beside a caption that said, “Proud to be shattering your expectations of what a tattoo shop should be, every day of the week,” obviously an army of Sade obsessives rushed to the store’s side.

“All that says is your understanding of the world and what’s happening in it... Is shall we say, limited lol,” one wrote.

Sade is one of the most relentlessly quiet famous people on the planet. But in her extended silences, her place in the pantheon of cultural influence has only grown more enormous.

This impact includes tattoos. More than 20 East River Tattoo clients have had their bodies adorned with Ms. Adu’s visage over the last year or so. A manager noted that that was 20 more requests than they’d gotten for Madonna and Janet Jackson.

The most famous Sade tattoo, however, belongs to Drake. He premiered it on Instagram this March. In it, Ms. Adu’s hair is hidden, Nina Simone-like, beneath a turban.

In February 2017, the street wear brand Supreme put Ms. Adu’s image on a coveted limited-edition T-shirt. In March, Reese Witherspoon’s Type A character on “Big Little Lies” established her remove from pop culture when she hears Sade on the car stereo and mistakes it for Adele.

Demand for T-shirts from Sade’s 1992 and 2001 tours has so outstripped supply that vintage sellers like Chico’s Closet in Los Angeles have largely abandoned eBay (and its commission fees) and moved to Instagram, where the mere act of hashtagging Sade leads to whack-a-mole-like sales.

Some of this Sade fever can be traced to Patrick Matamoros, 41, a high-end dealer who finds rare T-shirts, distresses them to perfection and then places them on to the backs of celebrity clients such as Rihanna, Diplo and Mark Ronson.

Photo

Two years ago, Mr. Matamoros sold a tee from Sade’s 1993 Love Deluxe tour to Kanye West. “I’d sold Sade shirts to famous people before that, but something happens when Kanye wears a shirt that I still don’t understand,” Mr. Matamoros said on a recent afternoon.

This conversation was in his Lower East Side apartment, and he was in a Run-DMC shirt and a Sade crew hat that he sells for as much as $600.

He picked up a vintage Phil Spector shirt and poked a hole through one of the sleeves with his big toe.

“I used to say to people about Sade, ‘This isn’t going to impress everyone in the room,” Mr. Matamoros said. “Get an Iron Maiden shirt if that’s what you want. Sade was for two people in the room, but it was the right two people.”

Photo

Not anymore. Now, everyone wants them and Mr. Matamoros says even he rarely gets them without paying at least $300 a pop, which happens to be more than any other female singer alive today.

Much of the current fascination with Sade derives from the fact that her fans know so little about her, starting with the pronunciation of her name. (Many Americans believe it’s pronounced Shar-day; it’s Sha-day.) In an era that rewards people less for their talent than for their associations with other famous people and the ability to leverage those associations over Instagram and Twitter, Sade’s disinterest in self-promotion has had a reverse effect.

Her longstanding lack of interest in speaking about herself makes the world more likely to want to speak about her.

For college, Ms. Adu went to what is now called Central Saint Martins, in London, then and now the world’s most prestigious fashion school. To make extra money, said Albert Watson, who photographed the covers of the band’s “Love Deluxe” and “Lover’s Rock” albums, Ms. Adu took a job selling clothes at the Camden Street Market.

She began singing backup in a local band, and moved to frontwoman only reluctantly. “The lead singer left,” she later said.

Photo

It turned out she was great, with a breathy voice that was heard by Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman, playing in a band called Pride. They asked Ms. Adu to start singing with them.

In 1982 or 1983, Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Denman left Pride and formed a group around Sade.

They signed to Epic Records, where executives quickly realized they were dealing with an artist with no direct historical precedent.

“She was one of those rare artists I fell completely in love with because she came just the way she is now,” said Susan Blond, a former vice president and publicity director at Epic who now heads an agency where clients have included Aerosmith, Will.I.Am and Morrissey.

“She was very young, but she was very sophisticated,” Ms. Blond said. “She didn’t follow anyone else’s style. No one was as beautiful or had as sleek of a look as her. She didn’t mind designer clothes, but you’d never ever look at her and say, ‘Oh that’s a Chanel outfit.’ She never looked like a brand. And her songs seemed to become classics immediately.”

In a way, Ms. Adu’s sphinx-y stare, keen fashion sense and interest in Afro-Caribbean rhythms owed a debt to Grace Jones, but her pensive lyrics and languid delivery of them flipped the script by placing romance above sex.

When Ms. Adu sang about a male gigolo on her breakout hit, “Smooth Operator,” she was lamenting what happens when “sentiment is left to chance.”

The saxophone signaled sorrow. Ms. Adu wasn’t asking — as Ms. Jones did — for a guy to “drive it in between.”

Shortly before Sade won the 1986 Grammy for best new artist, she appeared on “Saturday Night Live” with Tom Hanks, who recalled the experience in an email: “It was the first time I did ‘SNL,’ which is a major event an anyone’s life, a heady week of being surrounded by all that history. I’d never been in 30 Rock, much less invited to work on the 17th floor or in Studio 8-H. I thought the big talisman for being on ‘SNL’ was the job of saying ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, Sade.’ which is actually written on a cue card, by the way.’

Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in her command of her art, as well as her presence. Having very little in common with her, save the close approximation of dressing quarters, a bit of me yearned to be as cool and composed as Sade. She remains a Smooth Operator, no?”

Dan Beck, a former senior vice president at Epic who worked on the United States promotion for Sade’s first four albums, said, “There was grace to everything she did.”

Photo

Although Ms. Adu looked forward to the publicity campaigns of record releases about as much as one would a root canal, Mr. Beck said, this wasn’t because she was temperamental or diva-ish.

She merely regarded the project of explication with suspicion. She seemed to operate according to the principle that narcissism was not the precondition for artistic exploration, but was instead its enemy.

“She never enjoyed promotion of any type,” Mr. Beck said. “It was painful for her. Eventually, I flew over to London to see her and we struck a deal. I said that if she would commit to giving me three weeks of nonstop publicity for each album, everything but the kitchen sink, VH1 and radio stuff and photo shoots, I would go back to my counterparts at the label and get them to put everything they needed into that time period. I said, ‘You’ll hate it but we’ll get it all done and when you’re done you’re done.’ And she laughed, and that’s what we did for the next two albums after that.”

(She and her bandmates also hired the manager Roger Davies, who guided the second half of Tina Turner’s career and long understood that mystery equaled timelessness.)

As the years went by, the break between albums stretched ever longer. She wanted to have normal relationships. She wanted to record when she actually had something to say.

Photo

Sade’s 1992 album, “Love Deluxe,” arrived four years after “Stronger Than Pride.” Ms. Adu smiled as she told Mr. Beck she might not have gone back into the studio to record — except the guys in the band wanted to return to work, he said. “I thought that was so sweet.” (In a 1992 interview she said, “It’s good that we stopped and didn’t try to make another one off the back of the previous album. You get some perspective on why you’re making a record.”)

Then, she did the photo shoot for the album and Mr. Watson, a contributor to Vogue who directed a number of Sade’s videos, proposed shooting her topless with metallic body paint, her hands covering her chest.

“She said, ‘I don’t mind. I’ll do that for you, but I don’t want it to be anywhere near the album cover,’” Mr. Watson said. “I said, ‘The shoot is for you. You control all the images.’ Then she looked at it and said it was too sexy.” Eventually, in conversation with the band, she agreed to use it, but the image remains an outlier in the way she has chosen to display herself.

A year later, Sade declined to release a house remix of “Pearls,” perhaps because there was something a little unseemly about people dancing to a song about the Somalian civil war. Then, a bootleg of it began making the rounds to D.J.s such as Junior Vasquez and Frankie Knuckles, who turned it into one of the era’s defining club tracks.

In 1995, a marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Pliego ended. Ms. Adu later said the pair had a difficult time navigating the demands of global fame with their private relationship. For a time, she lived in Jamaica with Bob Morgan, and they had a child.

An eight-year stretch between albums yielded “Lover’s Rock,” which had lots about romance but also brought a quiet force to songs about issues facing black people. The video for “King of Sorrow” was a masterstroke of Sade-ness, where she wore ball gowns and a bandanna, scrubbing a child’s shoe clean. Was it a cautionary tale for single parenthood or a fashion spread devoted to it? Who could say. It was lovely.

By the mid-aughts, Ms. Adu had become involved with a former fireman named Ian Watts. With one child each, they had settled into a countryside cottage near Stroud, England.

All this time, in luxurious quiet, her legend grew. The parasitic music business had driven many black female singers to seclusion, before Sade. The difference was that Ms. Adu appeared not to be combusting but thriving.

Her fans yearned for more material, all the while respecting her resolute privacy.

One secret to her absence is that it is not so total as to be suspicious. Tours in 2001 and 2011 showed her to be in fine form. (And the time away only helped build interest. The first tour for her 2001 album, “Lover’s Rock,” grossed $26 million. The second, for “Soldier of Love,” grossed $50 million.)

In 2012 Mr. Watson had a retrospective in Hamburg, and Ms. Adu flew in without any pomp or circumstance. She simply treated it as if she was showing up for a friend and smiled luminously as she sat with him in her trademark earrings, silk shirt and jeans.

When the exhibition was too crowded to really view the work, she returned the following morning to see it again, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Adu can also sometimes be spotted on her cat-loving child’s Instagram. On Mother’s Day this year, this undated portrait was published. Back in January, on the day she turned 58, a recent picture appeared. She looks impeccably happy.

Even with so little of her, you can see her look everywhere. Just last week, T:, The New York Times Style Magazine put Nicki Minaj on a cover, her hair in a black ponytail, a pair of gold hoops dangling.

Lauren Tabach-Bank, the magazine’s entertainment director, didn’t hesitate when asked whom they were channeling. “Sade,” she said. “You never know how someone’s going to react, but Sade is universally respected and lauded by musicians of all genres. Nicki saw the images and was like, ‘Sade, Oh my God. I love it.’ It felt expensive, cool and timeless.”

There’s talk of a Sade album coming next year, but even Mr. Watson, who sees her with some regularity, says he isn’t sure.

“It’s always like that with Sade,” he said. “Time will go by and she’ll start working on it. For her, it’s like getting out of bed on a Sunday morning. You know you don’t want to do it, but at some point you just do it.”

“When we were having our first success with her, I said, ‘This lady could have a hit album when she’s 90 years old.’ Most artists try too hard,” Mr. Beck said. “And consciously or unconsciously, I think people have a special appreciation for someone who isn’t out there waving their résumé at you every five minutes. She’s completely unique.”",Sade’s Quiet Storm of Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/style/sade-sade-sade.html

Fear can hold people back in many facets of their lives, but it’s especially true when it comes to learning to solve puzzles. For some reason, many people have surprisingly little faith in their abilities, and I wish I could convince them that they know so much more than they think they do and can do so much more than they believe they can.

Aisha Tyler, actress and co-host of CBS’s “The Talk,” demonstrates this by regaling readers of her book, “Self-Inflicted Wounds: Heartwarming Tales of Epic Humiliation,” with tales of mistakes she has made and decisions she has deeply regretted. All of these are told to let us in on the wisdom she has learned along the way, and might serve to make people feel a lot better about themselves. Nothing binds us like our shared human foibles.

If you earn less than $24,000, a silver plan will still be your best choice. That’s because you qualify for additional discounts that will lower your deductible and co-payment, making a silver plan even more generous than a gold plan. Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the president’s actions, will protect you from premium price increases.

The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year. The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.

Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.

Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend.
Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse.
“He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams.
After all, if your spouse is your best friend, then whom do you complain to your spouse about?","There is some research into this question. John Helliwell is a professor at the Vancouver School of Economics and the editor of the World Happiness Report. As he researched social connections a few years ago, he found that everyone derives benefits from online friends and real-life friends, but the only friends that boost our life satisfaction are real friends.

“But while the effects of real friends on your well-being is important for everybody,” he said, “they are less so for married people than for singles. That’s how we got to the idea that marriage is a kind of ‘super-friendship.’”

Dr. Helliwell and a colleague discovered that a long-running study in Britain had data that may illuminate this question. Between 1991 and 2009, the British Household Panel Survey asked 30,000 people to quantify their life satisfaction. In general, married people expressed higher satisfaction, he said, and were better able to manage the dip in well-being that most people experience in middle age, as they face work stress, caring for aging parents and other pressures.

But an entirely separate part of the study asked people to name their best friend. Those who listed their spouse were twice as likely to have higher life satisfaction. Slightly more men than women made that choice, he said, “which makes sense, because men tend to have fewer friends.”

Is feeling this way about your spouse necessary for a good marriage? I asked.

“Absolutely not,” Dr. Helliwell said. “The benefits of marriage are strong even for those who are littered with outside friends. It’s just bigger for those who consider their spouse their closest friend. It’s a bonus.”

Others are not so sure.

Amir Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University, and the co-author of “Attached.” A student of social relations, Dr. Levine explained that everyone has what he calls a hierarchy of attachment, meaning if something bad happens to us, we have a ranking of the people we call. In our early decades, those on the highest rungs are usually our parents or other family members.

“The problem as you grow older is, how do you let somebody close who’s basically a total stranger?” he said. “Nature came up with a trick: It’s called attraction. Sexual attraction brings down all the barriers, lets you get close to a new person in a physical way that you don’t get close to your family.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Over time, of course, this physical connection wanes. While many bemoan this loss of titillation, Dr. Levine celebrates it. “It’s smart,” he said. “If you’re going to be crazy about the other person all the time, how are you going to raise kids? How are you going to be able to work?”

Instead of complaining, we should view this new phase as an achievement: “O.K., now I have this person I’m attached to. I have the feeling of security. That’s what allows me to be an individual again and self-actualize.”

It’s this feeling of security, Dr. Levine says, that leads us to describe our spouses as “friends.” But that language is not quite right, he says. First, couples still need what he calls “maintenance sex,” because it re-establishes physical closeness and renews attachment.

Second, the term “friendship” is “an underwhelming representation of what’s going on,” he said. “What people basically mean is, ‘I’m in a secure relationship. Being close to my partner is very rewarding. I trust them. They’re there for me in such a profound way that it allows me to have courage to create, to explore, to imagine.’”

Dr. Levine summarizes this feeling with the (somewhat awkward) acronym Carrp; your partner is consistent, available, responsive, reliable and predictable. But don’t we already have a word, “spouse,” that fits this description? I said. Why are we suddenly using the expression “best friend,” when that doesn’t seem to fit at all?

“Because not every spouse provides that,” he said, “and we’re indicating we don’t take it for granted. What we should probably be saying is ‘secure spouse.’”

There’s yet another problem with calling your husband or wife your best friend. The words mean totally different things.

Peter Pearson and Ellyn Bader are founders of the Couples Institute in Menlo Park, Calif., and the authors of “Tell Me No Lies.” They’ve also been married for more than 30 years. Dr. Pearson said there’s a critical difference between a best friend and a spouse. “One of the criteria for a best friend is you feel unconditionally accepted,” he said. “Do I care if my buddy Mark is messy in the kitchen, leaves his bathroom a shambles and doesn’t pay his income taxes?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But with a spouse, he said, you can’t avoid these topics.

Dr. Bader said that when couples are just getting to know each other, they often say they’re companions, and she’s fine with that. When couples have been together 30, 40 or 50 years, they use similar language, and that can be the mark of a healthy relationship.

“It’s the in-between ones, when they use the language of friendship, my stomach turns,” Dr. Bader said. “It’s a red flag for a lot of conflict avoidance and intensity avoidance. It often means they’ve given up on the complexity of being with somebody. Instead of saying, ‘Oh, well, that’s who they are,’ it’s better if they try to work things out.”

Dr. Bader said that she wished popular magazines would challenge the notion that you shouldn’t get married to change someone. “I think that’s what marriage is about,” she said. “It’s where some of the juices come from, and it’s also how you get the best out of the person you marry.”

A good marriage, she said, is when people “push each other, challenge each other, encourage each other and, yes, change each other.”

Asked if they were best friends, they laughed. “We’re good friends,” Dr. Pearson said.

“Really good friends,” Dr. Bader said. “He’s lots of things that my best friend isn’t, but my best friend is lots of things he’s not.”

And that may be the point: Calling the person you’re married to your best friend may be shorthand for saying that you actually like your spouse and that you have shared history, shared lives and shared dreams. But in the end, the expression doesn’t do justice to the full meaning of marriage or to the full meaning of friendship.

Gregory Porter, ‘Nature Boy’

Gregory Porter’s new album “Nat King Cole and Me” pays tribute to one of his strongest influences. With its hearth-like comforts and flawless elocution, Cole’s voice is almost quintessentially dated. But Mr. Porter manages to embody some of the same principles — poise, savvy, listener validation — while punching it up with some contemporary solemnity and world-weariness. On “Nature Boy,” Cole’s signature song, the swarming and enchanting string arrangements of Vince Mendoza echo those on the original 1948 recording, though they’re more abundant. After a climactic interlude, Mr. Porter repeats the song’s famous catch phrase one last time, his voice now measured and low: “The greatest thing you’ll ever learn/Is just to love and be loved in return.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Brian Eno and Kevin Shields, ‘Only Once Away My Son’

How did this team-up take so long to happen? Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and the producer-songwriter-conceptualist Brian Eno both cherish the resonant, the amorphous, the unmoored, the immersive, the destabilizing. “Only Once Away My Son,” an instrumental, has a deceptive opening, with an urgent drum-and-cymbal beat that soon evaporates. The rest blends tinkly bell tones and almost subliminally soothing low notes with what must be Mr. Shields’s swaths of hovering tremolo guitar: freneticism that begins on a far horizon, draws close and lingers, menacingly, before finding what sounds more like respite than resolution. JON PARELES

Clean Bandit Featuring Julia Michaels, ‘I Miss You’

Sometimes Julia Michaels sings like she’s choking on the words, as if she’s turning away from them as soon as they escape from her mouth. On “I Miss You,” an affecting collaboration with the austere British dance-pop outfit Clean Bandit, she’s at her most forlorn: “You weren’t a fan of pictures, so I hardly ever took ‘em/Got ‘em saved in my mind from the bedroom/So that way I can’t forget your skin.” JON CARAMANICA

Rhye, ‘Taste’

The elusive R&B group Rhye , led by the singer Milosh, reappears with the insinuating “Taste,” a bedroom whisper — “I’m not awake, I’m not alone” — delivered in a perfectly androgynous falsetto. It’s got a subdued funk pulse hinting at Sly and the Family Stone’s “Family Affair,” interlaced with burbling chamber-pop woodwinds; it never gets anywhere near too pushy. J.P.

The Weather Station, ‘You and I (on the Other Side of the World)’

Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian songwriter who leads the Weather Station, sings as if she’s spent a lot of time pondering her way toward complicated conclusions. “You and I (on the Other Side of the World)” is a folk-rock meditation exploring the mysteries of an enduring marriage: “More intimate than I could imagine/But with space I cannot fathom.” The music harks back to the late 1960s, mostly clinging to two chords as string arrangements rise and subside in the background, mirroring hopes and uncertainties. J.P.

Snoh Aalegra Featuring Logic, ‘Sometimes’

The slow-and-low hip-hop-soul saunter of 1995-97 finds new life in “Sometimes,” one of the standout songs from the impressive new Snoh Aalegra album “FEELS.” On this song, she floats somewhere between neo-soul — its original incarnation — and trip-hop, singing breathily and with purpose. A slickly sneering verse from Logic adds acid and bite. J.C.

Sleigh Bells, ‘And Saints’

So long, power chords. “And Saints,” from a coming EP titled “Kid Kruschev,” sets aside Sleigh Bells’ usual drums-and-guitar bravado for a different minimal configuration: just motoric bass notes and high, filmy synthesizer tones enfolding Alexis Krauss’s distraught voice and elusive tidings: “Temple throb, dust lakes/Black gold, tigers and saints.” Whatever she's going through is more than a headache. J.P.

Kap G Featuring Lil Baby, ‘Pull Up’

Kap G is one of hip-hop’s underrated melodists. He sing-raps with a slur, leaving his vocals round and a little fuzzy. “Pull Up” plays to his strengths — he sounds woozy, sweet, a little distant, easing between tight clusters of words and dreamy smeared syllables. Behind him, the beat — produced by Young TT & Squat Beats — tinkles and creeps while Kap G elegantly swerves. J.C.

John McNeil and Mike Fahie, ‘Can Do’

Here’s an item on the list of “things we don’t see a lot of anymore” in jazz: a close rapport between two musicians, forged on the jam session stage, week after week over a series of years. But that’s what John McNeil, a trumpeter, and Mike Fahie, a trombonist, have developed. They spent roughly a decade leading sessions at watering holes around New York, mentoring younger musicians and deepening a repertoire. Still, for their debut album together, “Plainsong,” they’ve put the focus on their original compositions, not standard fare. The tunes are harmonically snaked and rhythmically relentless; they highlight the horn players’ teasing interplay, and keep the stellar rhythm section — the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Billy Hart — on the move. Mr. McNeil and Mr. Fahie wrote the uptempo “Can Do” together, and it’s a highlight. G.R.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

PITTSBURGH — October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I have breast cancer. The country is fully pinked out in support of breast cancer screening and research, and though I know all the pink is meant to make me feel good, to tell me that the entire country has my back, I actually find it profoundly alienating. Pink is not a serious color, though cancer is a very serious disease. Pink is about femininity; cancer is about staying alive.

I am lucky, if one can say that, within the context of possible cancer diagnoses. My breast cancer is small, has the tumor markers most favorable for treatment (estrogen- and progesterone-positive, HER2-negative) and is very slow-growing. A friend of mine, a doctor, trying to allay his anxiety and mine, joked that based on these results, I didn’t really even have breast cancer.

But breast cancer, even when one has a good prognosis, always raises the possibility of mastectomy, a surgery that removes the patient’s disease but is also said to disfigure her in a way that can compromise her femininity. The question that looms, reinforced by the ubiquitous pink, is whether a woman who has lost her breasts to mastectomy will still be a whole woman.

I have to say, speaking as a breast cancer patient, that the question never crossed my mind. I am not worried about losing my femininity to breast cancer surgery; I’m worried about losing my future to the disease. The real worry with breast cancer is metastasis: spread. And even though my present prognosis is good, there are reasons prophylactic double mastectomy would not be an unreasonable choice for me. However, after genetic testing and an M.R.I., I chose lumpectomy, with radiation, instead of mastectomy. Avoiding major surgery made the most sense in my specific situation; that mastectomy would threaten my womanliness did not factor in.

It’s interesting, that contrast between the frivolousness implied by femininity and the solemnity that marks a diagnosis of cancer. I’m an oncology nurse turned hospice nurse, and though I’ve seen many cancer patients return home to live their lives, I’ve seen more than a few of them die of their disease. It is not an abstraction, nor an exaggeration, to describe cancer as a killer.

And it’s that fear of cancer’s potential deadliness that overwhelmingly preoccupies all the breast cancer patients I’ve heard from since I received my diagnosis in mid-September. A colleague who has had a couple of biopsies since her treatment, but no new disease, wrote eloquently to me about how tai chi and dark chocolate help tamp down her fear that her cancer will return. A friend reminded me that her mother has outlived her diagnosis by over 20 years. And a friend of friends, who chose to have a double mastectomy, spoke of the enormous peace of mind the operation gave her and her sister, who also had breast cancer.

What resonates in each of these stories is two words: I lived. These women survived their cancer and keep on living.

In my own work in oncology, I primarily took care of patients with what we call liquid tumors: leukemia, lymphoma. We say in oncology that bad diseases require bad treatments, meaning savage and harsh, and treatments for acute leukemia are very bad. The chemotherapy causes patients to lose their hair, develop terrible mouth sores, suffer gastrointestinal distress and see their immune systems compromised.

I never, though, had a patient whose worry about those side effects came close to her worry about the disease. Being preoccupied with saving one’s life produces a myopia, in which other worries unrelated to one’s possibly imminent death fall away.

I did ask my husband, “If I lose my breasts, will you love me the same way?” I was half-joking, but the question was also ridiculous because I knew the answer. Knew it: “Yes.” Still. I feel that my asking it resulted from a kind of primordial sexism that, despite my best efforts, continues to infect my thoughts. The association of femininity and breast cancer is pernicious, because it genders the disease, meaning that a diagnosis of breast cancer marks patients as women first, people second. It implies that our womanliness is diseased, not our bodies.

“Be more than pink,” the Susan G. Komen website says, with links to information about supporting breast cancer research. The phrase suggests that pink doesn’t tell the whole story of breast cancer. I would take that statement further, arguing that it insults breast cancer patients to conjoin our femininity and this frightening disease.

My cancer was diagnosed via screening, a callback after my yearly mammogram. The tech finished the follow-up ultrasound, and then the radiologist, after a wait, came in. She stood a long time, saying nothing, and I realized belatedly that her silence resulted from concern. Because then she said, “We see a mass here at 9 o’clock.” I cried in the screening room while the tech held me, as tightly as if I were her own child, and I didn’t fear for some ephemeral sense of girlishness or sexiness, but rather for my life.",Breast Cancer Is Serious.

But here are some tips from design and color experts on how to use dark colors without becoming overwhelmed — or claustrophobic.

START SMALL If you’re nervous about playing with a deep, dark hue, “limit the color to the inside of cabinets, backs of bookshelves or a painted floor,” said Donald Kaufman, who owns the paint company Donald Kaufman Color with his wife, Taffy Dahl. “Dark, bold windows often bring the outside in.”

Ms. Studholme, of Farrow & Ball, suggested starting with a contained space like a powder room, the underside of a claw-foot tub or a hallway. “When you arrive, it creates a sense of drama,” she said. “You come through and go, ‘Wow.’” An added bonus, she noted: “A dark color in the hall makes the rooms off the hall feel really big and light.”

Ellen O’Neill, director of strategic design intelligence for Benjamin Moore, recommends starting with a focal point, like a fireplace mantel or the inside of shelves or drawers. “I recently photographed a home where the owner painted the inside of the drawers of an antique Chippendale chest a rich aubergine,” she said. “What a color surprise every time you open a drawer.” And as you become more confident, she said, “you can graduate to painting doors to a room or hallway, window trim or wainscoting.”

TEST IT OUT When you’re ready to tackle a whole room, “start with a color family that is already dominant in the home and select two to three shades that you feel makes a statement,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I’d get quarts of each color and paint large swatches of each, one set next to a window and one set in a corner. Observe how the room’s lighting affects the colors three times a day.”

EMBRACE THE DARKNESS “A deep, rich color goes an especially long way in a room without a lot of natural light, as dim rooms look particularly dull in lighter colors,” said Frances Merrill, the founder of Reath Design in Los Angeles, who painted her children’s room Farrow & Ball’s Pigeon gray. “It makes the small space feel finished and gives definition to the ever-rotating collection of artwork.”

In the playroom, she used Templeton Gray from Benjamin Moore. “Every surface in this room is usually covered in a layer of Legos and half-finished science experiments,” she said. “I find that the deeper colors mask the chaos.”

“Conventional wisdom states that small spaces — especially those facing north — should be lightened to increase the sense of space,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute consultancy. “However, painting trim a lighter color in an area painted with darker hues can actually increase the illusion of space,” she said, because it creates a “greater impression of height or width in the space.”

Whatever your situation, “it’s best to work with what you’ve got, rather than try to fight the light,” said Ms. Studholme of Farrow & Ball, which offers a guide to how light affects color on its website.

PREPARATION IS KEY “Before painting, ensure surfaces are sound, clean, dry and free from dirt, grease and any other contamination,” said Ms. Cosby of Farrow & Ball. “Always sand down surfaces to achieve a smooth base.”

And if you change your mind later, dark colors are just as easy to paint over as light ones, assuming you prep properly. “Start by priming over the bold hue, then apply two coats of the desired color,” said Ms. O’Neill of Benjamin Moore. But “be sure to allow the primer coat to dry completely before applying the first coat of color.”

GO HALFSIES To add “sophistication and spirit” to a client’s “stark, boxy, white rental,” Alex Kalita, a founder of Common Bond Design in Manhattan, painted the bottom half of the bedroom wall in Hague Blue from Farrow & Ball. She calls it “the chair-rail effect” and notes that it serves a few purposes: “It simulates architectural variation in otherwise uniform space; it ties in the building’s teal window frames; and it leverages the cozy, rich, complex and grown-up quality of Hague Blue, while maintaining the practical qualities of white paint, like the illusion of ceiling height.”

Another tip: “If you’re tempted to go dark and bold on the walls, but you prefer a restrained aesthetic, try keeping the furniture neutral,” Ms. Kalita said. “You can even make bulkier pieces recede by camouflaging them in the wall color. We had our client’s Wonk NYC dresser color-matched to Hague Blue, so that the piece could augment the client’s storage without competing for attention with the room’s more deliberate and sculptural design elements. Dark walls do a good job of visually absorbing things.”

FINALLY, BE BRAVE “I encourage people to be brave with color and unleash their inner artist,” said Ms. Eiseman of the Pantone Color Institute. “Experiment with color, have fun with it, allow yourself to live with it for a while. It is, after all, just one or two cans of paint. And when, and if, you tire of it, move on to another color and treat yourself to another creative exercise.”",Scared of Dark Paint?

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened.

Who’s ready for a very “Stranger Things” Halloween? That wildly popular sci-fi/horror series is returning to Netflix just in time for that spookiest of holidays. Set around October 1984, roughly a year after the events of Season 1, the second season will rejoin the citizens of Hawkins, Ind., as they battle an otherworldly “shadow monster” that promises to make the rampaging Demogorgon of Season 1 look like a middle schooler in a homemade Halloween costume.

Will and the Demogorgon

The center of the “Stranger Things” universe is the Byers family: the geeky 12-year-old Will (Noah Schnapp), who disappears on his way home from a Dungeons & Dragons game; his older brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), a teenage outcast who loves punk music; and their fragile but fiercely devoted single mom, Joyce (Winona Ryder).

As we find out, Will was spirited away to a creepy parallel dimension known as the Upside Down, by a monster whose head resembles a Venus fly trap. Will’s friends start calling the creature Demogorgon, after a demon from Dungeons and Dragons.

In the Season 1 finale, Jonathan; his friend Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer); and her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery), booby-trap the Byers house and lure the Demogorgon there in hopes of killing it. The teens put up a valiant fight, but as soon as they manage to set the monster on fire, it escapes. Thankfully, they’ve distracted it just long enough to allow Joyce to sneak into the Upside Down in hopes of saving Will.

In the final scene of the season, Will, Joyce and Jonathan celebrate Christmas together at home. It’s a happy ending — until Will starts to feel sick, coughs up a sluglike creature in the bathroom and is transported, for a moment, back to the Upside Down. You can take the kid out of the nightmare realm, but it seems that you can’t quite take the nightmare realm out of the kid.

A scene from “Stranger Things.” Netflix

The Lab and the Upside Down

Although the show spends plenty of time in the Upside Down, it’s still not entirely clear what this parallel reality actually is. We do know that a portal opened between the two realms when scientists at the Hawkins National Laboratory, a secretive government facility, used a telekinetic girl called simply “11” (Millie Bobby Brown) to make contact with the monster.

The Upside Down looks the way Hawkins might if its buildings and trees were all decaying, the sun never shined and everything were covered in vines made out of mucous. The air is supposedly toxic. (Uproxx has a great list of questions about the Upside Down that “Stranger Things” hasn’t answered yet.)

In the real Hawkins, the lab’s staff is desperate to find Eleven, who was the prisoner of its leader, Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), a research scientist who abducted the girl and raised her to consider him her father. As Brenner hunts for her, Will’s friends and family uncover the connection between the laboratory and the boy’s disappearance. A final showdown between the kids, the Demogorgon and Brenner’s minions leaves many of those minions dead. Going into Season 2, it’s not clear whether the scientist lived through the battle.

Eleven

Eleven isn’t just any psychokinetic tween. The show implies that she’s also the missing daughter of Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins), a local woman who accidentally got pregnant while participating in one of Brenner’s deeply unethical experiments. She is certain that her daughter, Jane, who was born with telekinesis and ESP, was abducted as a baby. But the lab’s cover-up has led her relatives to believe that Terry, who’s been catatonic for years, miscarried in her third trimester and became delusional after suffering that loss.

Because she’s spent her entire life in the lab undergoing Brenner’s experiments, Eleven is silent, scared and largely ignorant about the outside world by the time she meets Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). It’s with those three boys that she learns about the small pleasures of middle-school life, from frozen waffles to role-playing games.

Eleven’s story appears to end in the season finale’s climactic middle-school showdown, when she uses her powers to vanquish the Demogorgon and save her new buddies. Both she and the monster disappear. It’s a heartbreaking sacrifice, but it’s pretty clear she’ll be back for Season 2.

The Boys

While searching for Will, his friends meet an escaped Eleven and hide her in Mike’s basement. In hopes of making contact with Will, Dustin builds a sensory deprivation tank in the middle-school gym in order to recreate the setting where Eleven first glimpsed the Upside Down. And Lucas, who’s initially more suspicious of Eleven than the other boys are, goes on a solo spy mission at the laboratory. His reconnaissance helps her evade the feds — for a while.

Love, Hawkins Style

Just before Eleven battles the Demogorgon, Mike musters the courage to ask her to the school’s Snow Ball, and they kiss. His infatuation with her was palpable for most of the season, so their separation soon after is painful to see.

Theirs isn’t the only relationship thrown into chaos by the Upside Down. After Nancy’s best friend, Barb Holland (Shannon Purser), vanishes in much the same way Will did, Nancy and Jonathan investigate the disappearances together. Steve believes they’re hooking up behind his back and paints graffiti all over Hawkins, calling her a slut. But Steve redeems himself when he tells off his nasty friends and joins Nancy and Jonathan in battling the Demogorgon. Sadly for Jonathan, who’s obviously in love with her, Nancy and Steve are back together by the end of the season.

Chief Jim Hopper

And then there’s the most obvious love interest for Joyce: the local police chief, Jim Hopper (David Harbour). Initially a cynical, private and somewhat debauched presence in Hawkins, he becomes her greatest adult ally in the search for Will, and the two of them wind up trudging through the Upside Down together to find him. Still, years after his young daughter’s death and the divorce it catalyzed, Hopper remains a haunted man. As he struggles to resuscitate Joyce’s son, he flashes back to his little girl’s final days in the hospital, as doctors tried and failed to do the same. With Will, however, the efforts to revive him are successful, and Hopper and Joyce soon carry the boy to safety.

For all his heroism, we’re stuck with the uncomfortable fact that he gave up Eleven’s location to Brenner — and that his relationship with the feds may not have ended there. In a subsequent, unexplained scene, Hopper reluctantly gets into a car with people who appear to be government agents. Along with Will’s momentary descent into the Upside Down and Eleven’s whereabouts, this meeting is one of the finale’s most captivating cliffhangers.

What About Barb?

There’s one final loose end, and it’s #JusticeForBarb. Barb was last seen in the Upside Down, looking very still and white and lifeless, with a slug crawling out of her mouth. The show’s creators, Ross and Matt Duffer, have confirmed her death. But in an interview, Matt promised that while the internet’s favorite character won’t return, her story isn’t entirely over. “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb,” he said.

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned her, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, who Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly enraged child advocates. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

The United States is in the throes of a great debate: Do we want — can we afford — to remain a safe haven for people who, unlike economic migrants, come here running for their lives? This year the administration slashed the number of refugees the United States will allow by more than half.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s whom we are turning our backs on first.

Ms. Gonzalez is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by the police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state fees. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she said, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who wakes up screaming with nightmares and crawls into bed with her — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Ms. Gonzalez is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Ms. Gonzalez and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress get rid of a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers — they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent, a remedy that has been the most successful path for these children to get legal status.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian be allowed to spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes in the United States as the authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a Border Patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that Border Patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have identified hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that Border Patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration curtailed a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. When that policy change was made, some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the addresses and names of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

Amid all this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, said Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally.

But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are appearing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

Dreamers, despite having the most to lose, have been most adamant in rejecting Trump’s proposals. “It’s a white-nationalist racist wish list,” said Cristina Jiménez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.",Trump’s Cruel Choice: Who Gets to Stay?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/dreamers-children-immigration-congress.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

(Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)

Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work. I even liked how I had written it.

But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros’ left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career. It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.

While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-racking.

So, goodbye Corey Seager story. I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.

Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs. As a reporter, I have no rooting interest. But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.

I reframed the story around Houston’s improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.

At 11:50 p.m., the night sports editor, Joel Petterson, emailed to remind me that they would need the story immediately when the game ended to get it into the final edition.

“Don’t worry if it’s sloppy, we’ll clean up whatever,” said Petterson, who has saved me on deadline before.

Within 10 minutes of his email, the Dodgers tied the score, at 5-5, with a home run by Yasiel Puig and a single by Enrique Hernandez. I wrote back to Petterson: “I’ve added like 50 white hairs the past three innings alone.” I had not gotten up from my seat since the fifth inning.

By now, I knew that I needed to come up with a way to capture the mayhem of the game, no matter the outcome. I wrote a broad introduction — or lede, as we call it in journalism — and worked backward through the wildest moments of the game. (The teams set a World Series record with eight home runs in total, including five in extra innings.) I left a few sentences with blanks, knowing I would fill in the final details — the time of the game, the last out, the winning hit.

As soon as the game ended, I sent in my story. After talking to the managers and players, I filed an updated version for the web, since the print deadline had long passed.

Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe company has come to the defense of its employee, Mr. Rodríguez, the environmental manager.
In November 2015, according to the lawyers’ report, the former security chief Mr. Bustillo met with a high-ranking Desa executive.
Mr. Bustillo returned to La Esperanza for several days at the end of February and arranged to meet with the same executive on March 2.
After the killing, Mr. Rodríguez, the environment manager, forwarded details of the crime scene report that police had provided to one of the company’s executives.","“The existing proof is conclusive regarding the participation of numerous state agents, high-ranking executives and employees of Desa in the planning, execution and cover-up of the assassination,” the lawyers wrote.

Desa has repeatedly denied any involvement in Ms. Cáceres’ death or any connection to “acts of violence and intimidation.”

Eight suspects are in custody, including Sergio Rodríguez Orellana, the social and environment manager for the company, and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a retired Honduran Army lieutenant who was Desa’s director of security until mid-2015.

“What the public ministry has yet to do is indict the people who hired Bustillo to plan the operation,” said Miguel Ángel Urbina Martínez, one of the lawyers reviewing the case at the request of Ms. Cáceres’s family. The lawyers’ report, which The New York Times has obtained, will be released Tuesday.

The government’s investigation, by an elite unit in the Honduran attorney general’s office, remains open, although the lawyers’ group said there was no sign that it had progressed beyond the eight suspects.

Two American advisers, a retired homicide detective and a former federal prosecutor, have been working with Honduran authorities since the first days of the inquiry, part of an effort by the United States Embassy to push the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández to solve high-profile criminal cases.

Many of those cases involve powerful groups that critics say operate beyond the law. “The great challenge for Honduras is to dismantle these parallel forces,” said Mr. Urbina, a criminal justice expert from Guatemala and an adviser on judicial reform.

To prepare the report, Mr. Urbina’s group examined some 40,000 pages of text messages, which were retrieved by Honduran government investigators from three cellphones, one seized at Desa’s offices and two used by Mr. Rodríguez and Mr. Bustillo.

The messages, according to the report, show that the two men remained in frequent contact with three high-ranking Desa executives as they tracked the movements of Ms. Cáceres and other members of her organization, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, known as Copinh.

The conversations reveal, the lawyers said, that the orders to threaten Copinh and sabotage its protests came from Desa executives who were exercising control over security forces in the area, issuing instructions and paying for police units’ food, lodging and radio equipment.

“There was this criminal structure comprised of company executives and employees, state agents and criminal gangs that used violence, threats and intimidation,” said Roxanna Altholz, the associate director of the Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the lawyers’ group.

The other members of the legal team are a former war crimes prosecutor, Dan Saxon, and two Colombian prosecutors who have tried human rights cases, Jorge E. Molano Rodríguez and Liliana María Uribe Tirado. They have been working on the case for a year, traveling to Honduras to conduct interviews and review case material.

The lawyers were chosen by Bertha Zúñiga, Ms. Cáceres’s daughter, with recommendations from the Center for Justice and International Law, a Latin American human rights organization.

The text messages were handed over to Ms. Cáceres’s family this May on the orders of a judge after Honduran prosecutors canceled four appointments to share their findings.

The question, Ms. Altholz said, was why the prosecutor’s office, which seized the phones in April and May last year, had failed to act on “the quality and the amount of information” that “it has had in its possession for the last year and a half.”

A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said he could not comment immediately.

For Ms. Cáceres’s daughter, the content of the messages only reinforces the sense that Desa’s executives felt untouchable. “They were so confident of impunity that they talked openly,” Ms. Zúñiga said.

The company has come to the defense of its employee, Mr. Rodríguez, the environmental manager. He is “a family man, honest and hard-working, who is unjustly deprived of his freedom,” Desa’s dam division, Agua Zarca Hydroelectric, said in an unsigned email. The company “completely trusts in the innocence of Mr. Rodríguez.”

Desa obtained a concession to build a dam on the Gualcarque River in western Honduras in 2009. By law the company was required to consult with the Lenca community, but Copinh opposed the project from the beginning, arguing that the dam would jeopardize the community’s water resources and livelihood.

From the start, Desa was an odd creation, said Juan Jiménez Mayor, the head of an anti-corruption commission backed by the Organization of American States. It had only $1,200 in equity when it won the dam concession, along with operating permits, water rights and a contract to sell power to the state electricity company.

In 2011, members of the Atala family, one of the most influential in Honduras, injected millions of dollars into the company and joined the board. Mr. Jiménez’ commission has begun to investigate Desa’s contracts, a move that drew an angry response from Honduran business groups.

Copinh fought the dam on several fronts. It filed legal challenges, led community meetings and brought a case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which ordered the Honduran government to provide protective measures for Ms. Cáceres. She had been receiving death threats and knew they were serious. Four members of Copinh were killed in 2013 and 2014.

In 2015, she won the Goldman Environmental Prize, which is awarded to grass-roots environmental leaders. But it was not enough to protect her.

In November 2015, according to the lawyers’ report, the former security chief Mr. Bustillo met with a high-ranking Desa executive. In January, he visited La Esperanza and later obtained a gun through Mariano Díaz Chávez, a former Honduran special forces officer who is accused of organizing the hit squad that assassinated Ms. Cáceres.

An attempt to kill Ms. Cáceres was planned for early February but called off, the lawyers said. “Mission aborted today,” Mr. Bustillo wrote to a Desa executive. “Yesterday, we couldn’t.”

The report did not name the Desa executives because they have not been charged by Honduran authorities.

Mr. Bustillo returned to La Esperanza for several days at the end of February and arranged to meet with the same executive on March 2. Early on March 3, after Ms. Cáceres was killed, Mr. Bustillo called him again.

After the killing, Mr. Rodríguez, the environment manager, forwarded details of the crime scene report that police had provided to one of the company’s executives.

The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

But if there is one point on which virtually every piece of research into the nature and causes of human happiness agrees, it is this: our happiness depends on other people.","This isolationist philosophy is showing up not just in the way that many Americans talk about happiness, but in how they spend their time. People who study these things have observed a marked increase in solitary “happiness pursuits” — activities carried out either completely alone or in a group without interaction — with the explicit aim of keeping each person locked in her own private emotional experience.

Spiritual and religious practice is slowly shifting from a community-based endeavor to a private one, with silent meditation retreats, mindfulness apps and yoga classes replacing church socials and collective worship. The self-help industry — with its guiding principle that the search for happiness should be an individual, self-focused enterprise — is booming, with Americans spending more than $1 billion on self-help books a year to help guide them on their inner journeys. Meanwhile, “self-care” has become the new going out.

But while placing more and more emphasis on seeking happiness within, Americans in general are spending less and less time actually connecting with other people. Nearly half of all meals eaten in this country are now eaten alone. Teenagers and young millennials are spending less time just “hanging out” with their friends than any generation in recent history, replacing real-world interaction with smartphones.

And it’s not just young people. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time Use Survey shows that the average American now spends less than four minutes a day “hosting and attending social events,” a category that covers all types of parties and other organized social occasions. That’s 24 hours a year, barely enough to cover Thanksgiving dinner, and your own child’s birthday party.

The same time-use data also allocates another, broader category to “socializing and communicating,” a designation that includes not just the good stuff — the heart-to-heart with an adoring spouse, or setting the world to rights with a dear friend over a bottle of wine — but any kind of socializing and communicating at all between two adults, where this is their main activity rather than an incidental part of something else, like working. All in all — and that includes daily bouts of nagging, arguing and whining — the average American spends barely more than half an hour a day on social communication. Compare that to time per day spent watching television (three hours) or even “grooming” (one hour for women, and just over 44 minutes for men).

Self-reflection, introspection and some degree of solitude are important parts of a psychologically healthy life. But somewhere along the line we seem to have gotten the balance wrong. Because far from confirming our insistence that “happiness comes from within,” a wide body of research tells us almost the exact opposite.

Academic happiness studies are full of anomalies and contradictions, often revealing more about the agendas and values of those conducting them than the realities of human emotion. But if there is one point on which virtually every piece of research into the nature and causes of human happiness agrees, it is this: our happiness depends on other people.

Study after study shows that good social relationships are the strongest, most consistent predictor there is of a happy life, even going so far as to call them a “necessary condition for happiness,” meaning that humans can’t actually be happy without them. This is a finding that cuts across race, age, gender, income and social class so overwhelmingly that it dwarfs any other factor.

And according to research, if we want to be happy, we should really be aiming to spend less time alone. Despite claiming to crave solitude when asked in the abstract, when sampled in the moment, people across the board consistently report themselves as happier when they are around other people than when they are on their own. Surprisingly this effect is not just true for people who consider themselves extroverts but equally strong for introverts as well.

What’s more, neglecting our social relationships is actually shockingly dangerous to our health. Research shows that a lack of social connection carries with it a risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking, and is roughly twice as dangerous to our health as obesity. The most significant thing we can do for our well-being is not to “find ourselves” or “go within.” It’s to invest as much time and effort as we can into nurturing the relationships we have with the people in our lives.

Given all that, the next time you have the choice between meditating and sitting in a bar with your friends complaining about meditation class, you should probably seriously consider going to the bar, no matter what your happiness app says.",Happiness Is Other People,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/happiness-is-other-people.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

the look Is Fall Dead? Daniel Arnold’s photographs showcase the season's identity crisis.

Daniel Arnold, a photographer known for capturing quirky moments on the street, waits all year for autumn to arrive.

“New York really hits its stride in the fall,” he said. “All year long you’re dealing with discomfort, and I feel like fall is the only time in New York where it’s steadily, predictably comfortable.”

Not this year, though. New Yorkers who view fall as fashion’s favorite season — denim jackets! boots! sweaters! — and rely on temperatures in the 60s and 70s to serve those looks have slogged through an unseasonably warm October. “Hotumn,” as some have taken to calling it.

“Unfortunately I keep dressing for the weather that I want, and I just keep getting sweaty all day because I am wearing layers and a hat, trying to summon the proper weather,” Mr. Arnold said.

So what is fall in New York without the crisp breeze?

Image Children try on new identities at New York Costumes. Credit Daniel Arnold for The New York Times

Sweater weather or not, it’s a time for new beginnings. It’s a brief respite from the tyranny of summer and before the severity of winter. If you’re the type of person who reads horoscopes, you’ll know that the beginning of Libra and Scorpio season signals transformation. But it’s usually plain to see: in the start of a new school year, the turning of the leaves, the return of beloved television shows and the sudden emergence of turtlenecks.

“There’s something about fall that I think becomes associated with rolling out this new version of yourself,” Mr. Arnold said. “It’s like an identity redefining time.”

This new identity can take on the form of a Halloween character. This year, Mr. Arnold noticed that more people were trying on politically themed costumes, like two children who put on Donald Trump and Melania Trump masks at a Halloween store in the East Village.

“Scandals, outrages and internet memes,” Mr. Arnold said of the themes of the costumes he saw. “I’m sure there will also be plenty of people who just cut two holes in a sheet.”

Despite the warm weather, some fall rituals persist. Take the Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade for example, where owners show off their outrageously costumed pets and spectators harvest content for Instagram. This year the temperature was 78 degrees, but that didn’t keep 500 dogs and nearly 25,000 spectators from showing up.

“The dog parade was really a hot dog parade,” Mr. Arnold said.

It’s also a time for New Yorkers to escape the city and enjoy the nature of the larger metropolitan area, whether that means taking the train to the Hudson Valley to see the leaves change, apple picking in New Jersey or a day trip to the expansive grounds at Storm King Art Center .

Others know that you don’t have to leave the five boroughs to find events that celebrate the fall harvest. Through Sunday, at the Queens Country Farm, you can get lost in a winding corn maze , and you can pick pumpkins there (or pretend to be one) all season long.

But if you’re going to a corn maze, Mr. Arnold would not recommend going it alone.

“It’s maddening,” he said of the experience. “It messes with your head.”

Inside the maze, the photographer was drawn to this fellow traveler. “I have a soft spot for these things where people’s T-shirts are accidentally nailing the whole situation,” he said.

For some adults, fall also marks the start of “cuffing season,” when people couple up in preparation for the winter months — whether with a partner, a puppy or even a slice of pizza.

“We become bowerbirds,” said Mr. Arnold. In case you missed David Attenborough’s BBC special , bowerbirds are creatures that create colorful nests to attract mates. “The instinct at this time of year is to find someone to get cozy with and to prepare yourself and your home and your body for this more vulnerable time.”

If it ever comes, that is.
